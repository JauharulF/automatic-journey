<START> this movie was yet another waste of time why oh why do i keep renting crap like this someone please tell me sigh oh well back to the movie at hand cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie like i did and just want to check out what's up in the last hopefully movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed then of course this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot evil grin then this movie is definitely for you d ok i'm lying at best this movie sucks ok i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool well coolish and i laughed quite a few times prolly at the wrong things but nevertheless i was amused but all in all the few things that barely makes the ok category isn't enough to make this movie worth it at all unless you count manos hand of fate one of the top ten movies ever
<START> a damn good movie one that is seriously underrated the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character i wish she was in more movies br br this movie should have a higher rating i give it a 10 10
<START> i had the privilege of attending a special screening of 'the absence of light' at a horror convention in ohio br br first off you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film saying now keep in mind we didn't have much money not that no budget films are bad but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse the results are always poor and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep fest br br actually 'absence of light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema it's the only time i've seen a dream cast of talented genre vets actually bore me charismatic actors like david hess tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no names who are their characters what are they talking about who cares it's all so dull you'll cease to care about anything or anyone br br after thirty minutes of this endurance test i gave up and walked out of the theater not surprisingly so did most of the cast members in attendance br br any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this with a little luck this movie won't ever see the light of day
<START> if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy then look no further br br starting at about the halfway point the beautiful and erotic arielle dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity that is the only thing that made this movie worth watching br br the story is both lame and preposterous the humor is corny and character development is basically non existent
<START> this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the feudal landowners like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the 13 century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman br br the story revolves around a clan chieftain robert roy mcgregor who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend alan mcdonald when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protÃ©gÃ© archibald cunningham and his sleazy factor killearn rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the duke of argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite br br the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is neeson's best performance his brogue albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband father and also touchingly loyal to his friend mcdonald who is accused of robbing him br br tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains archibald cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father br br the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair 'how fine you are to me ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema br br the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife mary mcgregor lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting killearn looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize their kinsman alastair mcgregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham br br of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale
<START> after being bitten by a bat in a cave a doctor named john beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man bat creature his wife assures him that there's nothing wrong with him it's all just due to rabies or the anti rabies drugs he's taking the local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome murders the bat people by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible film the script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity this pointless piece of crap is so mind numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it even the design of a man bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable avoid this stinker like the plague 2 out of 10
<START> someone or something thing is leaving puncture marks on the jugular and draining victims of their blood till dead police detective karl brettschneider melvyn douglas before slipping out of the b movie horror genre for greater heights is stumped at who or what is behind these notorious crimes the village is overcome by hysteria and karl depends on his trusted medical genius dr otto von niemann lionel atwill in yet another effective mad scientist role to provide some feedback as to what might be causing the deaths of innocents he also fears for the safety of his beloved ruth the lovely fay wray who stars for the third time with atwill after doctor x the mystery of the wax museum who is niemann's assistant br br dwight frye steals the film as a rather loony village idiot who collects bats and carries a demented demeanor wherever he goes it's easy to see why he becomes a suspect as local paranoia is at a fever pitch maude eburne provides the film's humor as a very naive and easily influenced patient of von niemann's who believes she has ailments she reads about in books near the laboratory where he works she's impressionable and often von niemann just humors her and constant fictional illnesses she feels plagued with lionel belmore returns as yet another frightened superstitious bÃ¼rgermeister br br creaky static but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast the film is obviously as low budget as they come but this doesn't hurt the film too much since it's put together rather well by director frank r strayer and his crew i'm certain the film's print has seen better days though this is the kind of b horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers the film's villain and his motives for feeding a synthetically made biological creature certainly provides a different take on the frankenstein formula many might be disappointed with the end results as the film strays away from being an actual supernatural tale about a real vampire killer causing the murders
<START> why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of roberto moreira's up against them all contra todos at the san francisco film festival it's about a hit man my friend said well and it's brazilian i added beautiful multicolored people tropical weather lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot ample enticements no doubt br br somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie really pretty horrible and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made br br so how on earth did contra todos get to make the rounds of berlin melbourne london manila stockholm cairo chicago numerous smaller local festivals and now san francisco apparently because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work br br first of all it won first prize at the rio film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year it must have been a bad year they've had much much better ones next snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and since the movie isn't featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics it keeps going the rounds br br festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot a chicago festival one called contra todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to claudia's s boyfriend as the stud of the slum like neighborhood soninha is teodoro's nymph like teen aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently hand held camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay the effect is unbearably raw and honest and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as dead ended as the lives on display not the best writing but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer br br contra todos does concern a hit man two hit men actually and a wife and daughter and a born again christian girlfriend it's shot in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera work mostly in a barren looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or village like brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as black orpheus pixote and city of god were made and not in rio this time but sÃ£o paulo br br the hit man with family problems is teodoro giulio lopez and his partner with a drug problem is waldomiro ailtan graÃ§a both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays teodoro's sluttish blonde wife clÃ¡udia leona cavalli and silvia lorenÃ§o who plays his pouting ready to revolt daughter soninha these actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas who knows in a better directed film they might even be good aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by teordoro or when he's busy gangs of thugs the principals don't work up much presence even though the camera magnifies their pores br br a couple of observers one at the berlin festival and one at london's did see this movie's failings but alas they're buried in the web hinterlands henry sheehan noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film sheehan wrote and hasn't made any creative use of the new medium nor he adds done anything else creative br br sheehan pointed out the movie's first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama that's supposed to ratchet up when half an hour into the action moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is at the very least a waste of time but ratcheting up is all moreira ever does like a little kid who's gotten a tool kit for his birthday and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill devastating but true br br writing about the 2004 london festival for kamera com metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the film's best feature yes very easily given that everything else is so bad alsanjak admitted that this low budget violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters and as a result of hope too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition the film is not helped by poor subtitling alsanjak's connecting contra todos to dogme and mike leigh didn't help matters br br apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence which when they come are just banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of low level hit men in working class neighborhoods but he can't make the characters which he sees generically come alive for us and the structure of the film shows that he also can't edit his material br br seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 28 2005
<START> this is an excellent heartbreaking movie it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin america kidnappings corruption ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career in my opinion dakota fanning is an amazing young actress the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed i believed every minute the cast is brilliant christopher walken mickey rourke are great as always walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor i would have loved to see more of both of them the authentic locations are remarkable the camera work is interesting and different there are many famous latin actors in the cast making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema i highly recommend this movie
<START> if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action a few of the actors i've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great rondo whom performs all the magic whit his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all br br get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving
<START> this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever the acting was pathetic jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions at the beginning of the movie she was supposed to be discouraged instead she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses they had to pluck out her everyone else was suffering from over acting as well it was flat out annoying it was also an insult to figure skaters jordan took a month to train and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team it's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work a pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating don't waste your life it doesn't even deserve one star
<START> possible spoilers br br when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like not too high but not low either this was nothing like i expected at all though it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make br br in the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes very obvious scenes as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times br br the ending is the most ridiculous of all though almost splatter comedy br br i'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes whole br br 4 10 movie man
<START> why every horror director wants to imitate the exorcist is a complete riddle to me as william friedkin's classic is a very overrated film and in my opinion not all that tense or shocking and yet here's another clean rip off a spanish one this time that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family paul naschy who i must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable exorcism is not only very unoriginal it's also an insufferably boring film here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments albeit very stupid and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money this is just an awful film end of story other european the excorcist rip offs are the antichrist and beyond the door and they suck as well
<START> this is one of the best crime drama movies during the late 1990s it was filled with a great cast a powerful storyline and many of the players involved gave great performances pacino was great he should have been nominated for something john cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesn't mind his louuu siana accent he may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect the way that pacino's character interacted with cusack's character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times danny aiello was superb as always david paymer was great in a supporting role bridget fonda was good but not memorable there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many it may take a second viewing to remember which zapatti was which after so many cross references one has to stop and think just to recap the ending didn't have a lot of sting it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown this was one of the few problems with the film since the movie wasn't billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed pacino and aiello were great but the film's lack of splash in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations it was semi successful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come br br so make yourself some lemon pudding you'll see and see this movie
<START> apart from helen bonham carter there is nothing worthy about this movie and the surprise ending the thought of a sequel is even more annoying save your money wait for the video and ignore that too
<START> this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old i began looking sometime before the rape scene and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking what kinda sick movie is this today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is it's exciting frightening shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river and there is nothing they can do about it it's something they have to live with this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart brilliant and horrifying br br and the acting is also great especially jon voight and burt reynolds magnificent acting in this movie all in all john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney's novel a must see for all the movie lovers
<START> ok another film bought by me and joe swatman ok this isn't the worst film i've reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap br br the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun the film wasn't as gory as we hoped i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack again i think the acting sucks sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason br br the absolute worst part is the ending it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw 2 but thats never gunna happen lets face it br br my ratings br br funny 4 100 mock how much fun we had mocking it 73 100 acting 8 100 generally 12 100
<START> this is a really funny film especially the second third and fourth time you watch it it's a pretty short film and i definitely recommend watching it more than once you will 'get it' more the second time br br it's like spinal tap but the rap version it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films but it's just a total p s take and isn't a problem because of the irony it creates br br plenty of stand out bits one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates and it will raise laughter br br my personal favourite part is the 'guerrillas in the midst' section great video superb
<START> jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget box office ones it's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets and the only star is barbara stanwyck but what a star of course br br stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help some psychological battling there br br it's a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that stanwyck is great should go without mention but i'll still praise her every time
<START> well i could nt get into the plot but thats just me maybe listless camera movements at times nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality the acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies which was nice the climax is confused and disjointed but still err riveting thanx to stella stevens br br the stunts are interesting specially because of the 70's las vegas backdrop there are a few jerky hand held camera movements at the end which keep me guessing for a while but i don't think i ll b chasing the dvd just yet
