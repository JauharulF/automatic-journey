<START> it really impresses me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me' but the reality is for them to appeal to you you'd have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn't it
<START> spoilers since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece phyllis murder mystery writer abigail mitchell ruth gordon has strong suspicions that it was phyllis' husband edmund galvin charles frank who was responsible for her death in fact abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident br br knowing that there's no evidence to have edmund arrested for phyillis' death and deciding to take the law into her own hands abigail cooks up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look like phyllis' death a tragic accident getting edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk in safe as she's about to leave on vacation for new york city abigail tricks him into going inside locking the startled and surprised edmund in with the safe being soundproof nobody at the mansion the butler maid and abigail's personal secretary veronica mariette hartley hear him screaming for help and the next day edmund is found suffocated to death veronica discovered edmund's body as she was about to put away for safe keeping abigail's latest murder mystery manuscript br br lt columbo peter falk is called on the case involving the strange death of edmund garvin to determine if it's a murder or a tragic accident going through edmund's apartment columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesn't have a single photo of his late wife who's been missing for just a month this ties into what abigail always felt about him in edmund not being in love with phyllis and also a suspect in her in abigail's mind murder br br columbo a big fan together with his wife of abigail's murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for edmund's death all the evidence points to abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was edmunds this all proved that abgail was in fact in the house not on her way to the airport when edmund was locked inside the walk in safe br br going through all the evidence columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is that conclusion is quickly checkmated when it's found out that edmund didn't even have a pen or pencil as well as light with the safe light bulb burned out on him to write it there's also something very odd that's inside the safe that has been on lt columbo's mind ever since he came on the case this has to do with the black paint residue that was found under the dead edmund's fingernails and on his belt buckle br br it's that evidence when put together with a number of other items in the safe that in the end hangs edmund's murder on the tricky and very cunning mystery writer abigail mitchell edmund let abigail unknowingly convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up by his breathing in using burnt out matchsticks to write on abigail last manuscript who murdered him abigail mitchell
<START> i wasn't expecting much of this film a fun little diversion wuthering heights could be turned into a plausible modern story nice and soapy melodramatic and intriguing but this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it wuthering heights at all it ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable mostly unsympathetic and frequently cruel to one another it changes the very nature of certain characters isabelle for instance in the novel had not a conniving bone in her body they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path but in this version catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care the dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces in place of depth or actual emotions we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face i've read criticism of the early 90's version emily bronte's wuthering heights which featured ralph fiennes and juliette binoche saying that it turned an intensely dark gothic story into a sudsy bodice ripper slightly valid comments but the mtv version goes a step further using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music
<START> i'm a big fan of westerns but this one whew what a stinker i think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog i think i could have written better dialog than this when i was in eighth grade and the poor actors given this terrible dialog none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous really i'm not kidding some of this is little better than what you'd get in an ed wood film br br the biggest tragedy is sterling hayden he was probably the big star in this movie which if you called it a b western you'd be lavishing praise upon it this is what should be called a b minus western perhaps pity sterling hayden who appeared at other times along with joan crawford bette davis frank sinatra and other major talents for him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life br br one annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven't shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy i know in the old west guys weren't always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go 'ewwww ' really this is a crummy western denver pyle also had to live this one down especially after appearances in so many great westerns bad bad movie
<START> a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lover's apartment rogers actually has two identities at the film's outset that of miss terry the dead victim's secretary along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand talbot instead of her paper's rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he's been out scooped br br here's a puzzle it's revealed during police inspector russell's purnell pratt investigation of harker's death that terry morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding harker's association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn't relevant until it's all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and who's making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss with the words you will hear it cut and pasted beneath apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house's radiator system which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs coby in the apartment below harker but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs coby's death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation br br it's these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the building's incinerator furnace however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred arthur hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room br br sorry but for all those reviewers who found a shriek in the night to be a satisfying whodunit i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesn't dance
<START> the plot of 'house of games' is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do she finally gets her revenge that's about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets it has to be the director mamet lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career so she can't perform this badly all the time she's supposed to go from uptight cool controlled professional to calculating wicked fast lady having fun as shown by the change from beige trouser suit which she seems to wear for three days straight including underwear to floppy floral sundress but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped precise way i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create at times 'house of games' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot the clunky vibes'n'oboe faux jazz soundtrack doesn't help either the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic two dimensional performances and they smoke too much
<START> i can safely admit as an imdb geek that 'phantom lady' will never crack into my film noir top twenty it may not even sneak into the top fifty but rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre it should be noted that 'phantom lady' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing all that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning br br the film doesn't get cooking until 'kansas' ella raines sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss scott anderson alan curtis who has been convicted of murder 'kansas' is anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night as the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of new york at night little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together to be honest the film belongs to raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest i'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film br br as interesting as raines is as a novice detective things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'kansas' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer elisha cook jr in search of some information to help her condemned boss she and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the all night jazz clubs trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet it could ruin the scene all together you'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out if you're lucky enough to have this film on dvd you'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again as good as raines is it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy it is mainly because of this scene that i rate 'phantom lady' a 7 instead of a 6 br br for the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene it is the 'drum sex scene' that separates this film from any others of the same ilk br br and just like it is said in the film that you never go wrong with vanilla i would also like to add that going with vanilla is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a tastier treat br br 7 10 clark richards
<START> action violence sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie and everything they do is done without reason mark l lester is un known for his violent without reason movies commando the base the story is weird but stupid the actors play their stupid characters very well i'm not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors it's another low budget unknown b series action movie if you saw something like operation delta force drive the patriot sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than misbegotten don't rent it and by the way don't rent any of the movies i mentioned i give it 1and a half out of5
<START> note that i did not say that it is better just more enjoyable the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving br br i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie as it has all the troma trademarks including spewing acidic liquids wisecracks from the villain after every murder a ridiculous bathtub rape scene which is sort of hard to get upset about since the rapist is a snowman and dumb deputies br br there's a lot to love br br 1 a snowman about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet drives a police cruiser around town br br 2 even though it is supposed to be close to or below freezing nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running br br 3 the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snow br br 4 a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered she talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house of all places in order to get it on but first she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine br br 5 after teen aged jake's head is cut off by a sled runner his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy the sheriff's son had anything to do with it the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn't have been fighting with jake because jake is at least two feet taller than tommy at that moment someone in the background chimes in not anymore br br 6 when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions if i were an actor i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point br br all in all a fun film there's not really even that much blood
<START> halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year i even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday this film is so great jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving this movie might be old but the story line still gets me right there every time and the acting was absolutely fantastic although i have not seen the remake i feel already that it was totally unnecessary i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic what kills me though is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original i am getting furious just thinking about it this movie was great and it will always be remembered in history as a classic
<START> bestselling writer george plimpton alan alda takes on an assignment for sports illustrated he is to go incognito to the detroit lions training camp and try out for a position as third string quarterback he is quickly found out by the team members featuring alex karras and mike lucci the entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer's determination to quarterback for a series in a real game br br this movie is alda's debut and also helped karras leave the gridiron for acting besides the 1968 detroit lions the cast also includes sugar ray robinson roy schieder and lauren hutton br br alex march directs this story based on plimton's book
<START> characters you don't care about relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other she was actually somewhat endearing in this role
<START> i question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the btk killer's motives are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters who is responsible for this don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough what a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims it was like a personality experiment what disturbs you more the slaughterhouse or the human murders they used actual names of some of the victims this movie was hideous disrespectful and insulting the creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda people need to awaken and redraw the line
<START> this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause one of the most important movies of all time the elements are simple yet fascinating the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds yet the story is always believable and never depressing the characters are so realistic a city dweller would recognize them as neighbors the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending buy this one for your permanent collection it is a piece of american history
<START> 30 seconds into the opening credits i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie but i didn't know just how bad then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie we'll have to turn the volume down make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd but that didn't help about half way through we turned it off now i've lived through some very bad movies before both with and without the aide of mystery science theater 3000 and svengoolie but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin i guess they were all hypnotized into death then hypnotized into rotting themselves stick to the real b movie cult classics like plan nine from outer space
<START> the only reason the norliss tapes deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast other than getting to see angie baby in a pre police woman performance there's nothing else worth seeing here br br the synopsis br br minor spoilers br br david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the norliss tapes a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural br br in the pilot episode a wealthy sculptor dies but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death we soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant immortality instead it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood br br blue faced yellow eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven't heard since you last watched scooby doo cartoons the sculptor attacks his wife dickinson one dark night she escapes and via a mutual acquaintance contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate br br so is this guy a vampire no there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard the sculptor doesn't drink his victims' blood he collects it how don't know we only see him attacking never collecting why to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood once it's finished sargoth plans to inhabit the statue using it as his gateway into our world br br the final analysis br br the norliss tapes wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason it was garbage as you can see from my synopsis the story is a paltry ill conceived mess the acting and dialogue offer no better this isn't even a contender for a so bad it's good award sometimes bad is just bad br br after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of the norliss tapes i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10 15 03 i wish i hadn't set myself up for the fall br br having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago i can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis either way they've offered you misleading reviews of the norliss tapes br br pauly orchid october 17 2003
<START> i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of spiritual new age types who quite unlike me very much enjoyed this movie although according to those that also knew the book apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense the movie is not quite as good so if you tend to think of yourself as spiritual believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like aura and astral body and don't mind the frequent use of the term energy outside of the context of physics or technology you might actually like the movie and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on br br however if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality and perhaps even expect reasonable non wooden dialog an acting then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie stay away br br don't even think about it tonight this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad such as plan 9 etc at the same time it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two d d being the other one i do not walk out on movies not even on this one but i should've when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on br br the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution or something like that they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe the movie is shock full with whoppers like that occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as another dimension or perhaps another plane only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment goodness br br at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the insights making up the prophecy painfully slow presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better more enlightened individuals br br good things about the movie some very pretty nature shots and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida br br i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind and unless that's your thing you better do something else with your time and money
<START> for all its visual delights how much better renaissance would have been in live action the animation is fantastic in the big picture yes but the characters are cold and hollow much like the story and the style of this film with real actors perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless there is much to admire here but at the end i found that all i could do was admire i did not enjoy the movie that much and it clarifies something that i did not see before that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film but without a good story and strong characters it can all be for nothing i will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing but sometimes it comes dangerously close i love dark sci fi thrillers blade runner and dark city are two films i thought were wonderful but blade runner had its tragic villain and dark city had its thought provoking story arc renaissance has shadow and light but little else i wish i could have liked this movie more but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that the renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life how ironic then that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies i've seen this year takes its title from the renaissance
<START> true story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters amusing though not really good monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago
<START> somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end this comedy is an utterly delightful never condescending or ridiculing look into the problems of a power man who likes to wear womenÂ´s clothes at nite br br julie walters is lovely as always but adrian pasdar is utterly credible and steals the film he she is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings
