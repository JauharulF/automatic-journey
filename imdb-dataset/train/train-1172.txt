<START> this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd the print is not great nor is the sound but if you have 1 00 and 90 or so minutes to spare you'll get your money's worth which is not saying an awful lot anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette whatever her charms may have been back in the day they are not evident in this film a great number of fine character actors appear in this film helen broderick zasu pitts even arden but the material falls remarkably short of their talents still it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing the musical numbers there are really only two are quite horrible clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original no no nanette for what it's worth the dvd can be had for 1 00 it's worth that much just to say you've seen it
<START> i'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile i love to praise a great movie and i'm not biased toward male movies legally blonde was an excellent film georgia rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst by the end of the film i didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved br br the most important thing in a film is a good story this story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep doesn't mean the story is good a good story has dynamic characters a dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie in georgia rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped secondly there were too many attempted dynamic characters pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time you've only got a couple hours in a movie that means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change even if i ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters i can't even say i liked anyone every character was a mess that's fine if your're writing american beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being no i'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions the dudley do right mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments and simon i mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally unless he's an actor or a politician this movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not
<START> the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manquÃ© that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film
<START> from the pen of richard condon the manchurian candidate 1962 comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination the story told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow all star cast considered this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew the novel was replete with the same short comings it seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in manchurian candidate a disappointment on all counts
<START> really an amazing pile of pap br br a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary br br the acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie br br watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me br br never ever ever again
<START> i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome dentists are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist it's cheesy it's fun sometimes it's scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken foree dawn of the dead is also in this one playing a nosy cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool torture death scenes check this one out
<START> acting this film is a very well acted film i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire he was incredible tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible paul newman good as always cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece and i rarely use that word conrad hall is a true genius if at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out when the camera is still there is a postcard like quality to the screen when the camera is moving every shot is planned to understated perfection but it doesn't stop there conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen his work on this movie made it what it is this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr black hawk down hero cthd moulin rouge and vertigo story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but i believe they missed the point of the movie it is a love story about a hit man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other the screen writing is worthy of an oscar music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film making world i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film 10 10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen
<START> what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club if he had he could have called it the razor's edge since the katha upanishad tells us the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard but maugham decided to stick with the well bred class and so we have darryl f zanuck's version of larry darrell recently returned from wwi carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner br br or as maugham tells us this is the young man of whom i write he is not famous it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature br br the razor's edge has all of zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy it's so earnest so sincere so self important as larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend isabel played by gene tierney his tragic childhood chum played by anne baxter the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by clifton webb and willie maugham himself played by herbert marshall taking notes the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is clifton webb as elliot templeton if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating clifton webb not elliot templeton br br zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century when he bought the rights to maugham's novel he waited a year until tyrone power was released from military service he made sure there were well dressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself the effort is as self conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux despite hollywood's view of things in the razor's edge i can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay br br after nearly two and a half hours we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale he's going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face my dear somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get i don't think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him you see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the world and he's got it larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine br br maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories to see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in encore trio and quartet and instead of wasting time with larry darrell spend some time with lawrence durrell the alexandria quartet is a good read
<START> great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young hellraiser chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here sally field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud feline sassy great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney
<START> again it seems totally illogical to me at least that arthur merits a mere 6 4 out of 10 possible steve gordon's one shot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements that he managed to make alcoholism laugh friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is in itself wonderful that he gave dudley moore his finest role and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact including the score seems to me patent and egregious i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud but apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed well i for one found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would be father in law absolute gems of background characters even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization and the late sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee but wrong about undertaking his role arthur makes no effort to underztand much less rationalize the scourge of alcoholism hey ifit ain't booze it's other drugs of choice including meth and addictions are merely symptoms not targets it simply observes in its own quizzical manner
<START> nice attempt and good ideas redemption of the prostitute human beings helping each other out but a poor result the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when the scent of the green papaya had a historical background trying to project this kind of ambiance muffled sounds and the slow pace of life on modern days leaves a feeling of fake besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious br br i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel ex marine in the movie was probably stationed during the war but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker br br an old poet with leprosy very doubtful not a disease for people of his condition a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry even more doubtful br br
<START> master director ching siu tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series a chinese ghost story 1 3 chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him beautiful actress joey wang wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon a wood devil who collects human souls for herself itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts leslie and joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness br br this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung his masterpieces include duel to the death 1983 and the swordsman series which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has there's plenty of wire'fu stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form br br the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer's mind to be interpreted and found another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts br br otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story 7 10 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
<START> awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br zaphoid br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z
<START> the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead' a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment a soft pillow for your head may you be 40 years in heaven before the devil knows you're dead ' first time screenwriter kelly masterson with some modifications by director sidney lumet has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but here very sensible manipulation of the flashback flash forward technique of storytelling by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong br br andy hanson philip seymour hoffman is a wealthy executive married to an emotionally needy gina marisa tomei and addicted to an expensive drug habit his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money andy's ne're do well younger brother hank ethan hawke is a life in ruins he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha amy ryan is behind in alimony and child support and has borrowed all he can from his friends and he needs money andy proposes a low key robbery of a small mall mom and pop jewelry store that promises safe quick cash for both the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents charles albert finney and nanette rosemary harris andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery but though hank agrees to the 'fail safe' plan he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car the robbery is horribly botched when nanette filing in for the regular clerk shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies charles and andy and hank and their respective partners are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn br br each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances and while we have come to expect that from hoffman hawke tomei finney ryan and harris it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful it is not an easy film to watch but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be grady harp
<START> i've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published so i must opine that someone at imdb com really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous so is the acting and direction pass on it
<START> citizenx 1995 is the developing world's answer to silence of the lambs where silence' terrorized our peace of mind citizen' exhausts and saddens us instead this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals br br citizenx may also argue against the death penalty far better than kevin spacey's the life of david gayle 2002 br br humans are machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains lizard logic why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped why do bloodthirsty women yell li lilililililii' at acts of obscene terrorism my own term for this is limbic domination' the lizard logic urge to dominate an enemy' if you have the words enemy' vengeance' in your vocabulary you're easily capable of limbic domination' br br in wwii devastated 1980s rostov located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo's urge for limbic domination' from overpowering his layers of civilization chikatilo jeffrey demunn 's easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldn't afford anything else br br citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such lambs' rostov's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years after the police arrested and let him go br br the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west vote grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter agency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime in the soviet union of citizenx however viktor burakov stephen rea 's killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy br br geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority to the point of complete obscurity in real life too chikatilo had a lifetime's experience blending in and evading capture br br his pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts perhaps by design stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov rea's russian accent is impenetrable and his burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyone br br so it's donald sutherland who walks away with the picture sutherland's col fetisov burakov's boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations his reawakening as a logic driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film's cornerstone idealism br br joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk overseeing the investigation naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home andrei chikatilo br br soon he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik detective gorbunov john wood insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals' the funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during bondarchuk's gorbunov's institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports as i suspected comrade it's fornication i've made some drawings' cue howling laughter br br 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky max von sydow who termed the unsub citizenx' he later also observed to fetisov burakov that together you make a wonderful person' we concur br br the drawn out pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost openness' that wasn't the contrast with perestroika restructuring' couldn't've been greater for the case although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruit br br in 1990 col fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference staff communications publicity suddenly all were available in just one night of telephoning around fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi's serial murder task force at quantico where fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators br br fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now colonel' burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse watershed scene fetisov's is the most tender apology i've ever seen on film privately i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance' he almost whispers br br a hbo production citizenx is a film of the highest caliber not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak shot exclusively in the most run down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest but randy edelman's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits br br chikatilo's actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world this makes the murders seem not entirely out of place but of course they were as president kennedy reminded us we all cherish the futures of our children' br br citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate so do some soldiers such limbic dominators' make poor humans br br warning spoiler the real andrei chikatilo was the world's most prolific known serial killer convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences one shot in the back of the head foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death br br conclusion the best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution executions merely guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how why they died nor do killers learn regret if they're dead br br vengeance doesn't unkill victims baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter domination once it's too late br br vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn't justice for the deceased it's appeasement of the living 10 10
<START> streetfight aka coonskin is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer ralph bakshi it is an oddity of the cinema and is very much worth seeing it is live action mixed with animation seemingly influenced on disney's legendary song of the south almost as if it is a response to that flick philip michael thomas later to become don johnson's sidekick on miami vice and scatman crothers most famous for his role in kubrick's the shining are prison escapees charles gordone and barry white yes that barry white are thomas' friends and plan to help him escape prison they are stuck at a police roadblock and crothers tells thomas a story about a black rabbit a bear and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence the story is animated and provides a lot of wonderous things to see like all of bakshi's films most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation true animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness the movie is very violent very sexual and it is mostly about battles between the races for a long time i thought i was watching something extremely important but after a while especially after i got done watching it it started to seem more like a run of the mill blacksploitation flick along the lines of superfly it's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything besides isn't bakshi white whatever the answer to that coonskin streetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans 7 10
<START> the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation lion king ii simba's pride is the by far the best direct to video sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by elton john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything you've come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew broderick robert guillame and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba rafiki and nala respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenas there are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it
<START> i'm not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to br br i didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing br br i will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining br br and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack br br but i don't think i'm going to get hooked on this series br br 3 10
<START> i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you won't be disappointed just awed
