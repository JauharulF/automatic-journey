<START> two warring shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box number aliases within this simple idea and an everyday setting lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit drama poignancy and irony that never lets up stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes although wrongly eclipsed by stewart's big films of 39 40 destry philadelphia story mr smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films
<START> this really doesn't match up to castle of cagliostro lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting br br the only good thing about this 'un is the nudity only in the uncut version provided by fujiko it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes coc had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set pieces the locations in tsotg are not very vivid or engaging br br zenigata goemon and jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time it's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing br br the dvd is in full frame with dolby stereo sound it has a decent amount of extras including quite a few trailers but one curious thing there is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote
<START> drew barrymore plays young holly gooding who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick highsmith george newbern and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her doppelganger or evil twin is out to kill her and her family br br this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously even if the film makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious doppelganger is muddled with some unpleasantly dumb dialog br br some viewers will note that drew's character's name is drawn from audrey hepburn's role in breakfast at tiffany's and that newbern's character's name is a play on the name of famed author patricia highsmith he is actually trying to re write breakfast as a horror film believe it or not br br i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film i mean writer director avi nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare br br after a silly villain explains everything to the audience confrontation the film goes on to submit a hideous out there climax that has to be seen to be believed this film certainly does not skimp on the gore br br but hey drew kills her mother in this one no i'm not joking jaid barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered br br drew is always very watchable and very sexy in this one newbern comes off as a likable enough nice sort of guy but the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with sally kellerman an attractive veteran who's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who's started a phone sex business br br the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy sordid little level br br 4 10
<START> the second renaissance part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans it all starts of with a single case in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want br br although an interesting premise the story gets really silly from then on with violent riots between the robots and mankind somehow it doesn't seem right as another reviewer points it it's all a little too clever br br the animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix in particular osiris work for the best as for second renaissance part 1 i'd say it's too violent and too silly 4 10
<START> norman is that you was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the prints from the theater can't have been that great still performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good br br what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family for that reason alone it's pretty interesting if not a little hollywood don't believe me check out lines about curtains etc very stereotypical not too deep br br but the movie really shines in a couple of areas there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife who's run away with his brother to ensenada in a souped up pinto the phone conversation across the border is really memorable br br but the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs to the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed and it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version i'm told still it's vintage madame and shouldn't be missed people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted enjoy the movie
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible there are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up i don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination let alone 2 here's why 1 sam lee portrays a angry irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad pros he's angry alright cons when it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadness disappointment he has in his father the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes br br 2 to connect the movie to the title there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer i understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not but it's just sooo dumb 3 why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer what the heck is wrong with this movie when the killer started stabbing an officer shoot him he's already dead what the heck there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but i do not know why he wasn't 4 during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt in the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer wtf 5 the sounds in the movie are off sync br br 6 i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight 7 this movie is just too violent without a purpose cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate they give them marijuana and coke this is overall the worst movie i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life worst movie ever
<START> this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie stallone was good as always michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain the music is fantastic especially the theme the movie is action packed and never dull if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger you won't be disappointed
<START> i'm not a stage purist a movie could have been made of this play and it would almost necessarily require changes comme ci comme ca but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full on shallow blockbuster mode it would be hard to imagine a worse director perhaps only josh logan jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did br br onstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage career experiences very 70s then bennett and hamlisch took some time handed them a song and cast them as themselves astonishing unbelievably modern the 'story'of acl is in turn about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of because the play doesn't matter it was meta before the idea was invented 25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive which is a hallmark of modern creativity that technique itself is compelling that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters what a gracious idea the stage play had one performance area an empty stage and three different ways to alter the backdrop to alleviate visual tedium not to keep viewers distracted the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted it worked just fine that was the point all these ideas are trampled or bastardized set wise there wasn't one and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows in which the exhilarating one is finally powerfully performed in full gold top hats and tails with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions the pent up anxiety of the play is released and audiences went nuts br br after grampa manhandles this it's like a mushed strangled bird he clearly has the earlier respected all that jazz and fosse's stage piece dancin' in mind as he makes his choices hamlisch's score was edgy interesting for it's time but time has not been kind to it it's as schmaltzy as jazz hands and that's before attenborough ever touches it he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left and mangling it br br a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater pivotal by it's absence in theater would be addressed in the film format there's never been a more frontal play the answer they came up with was i'm sorry what was the question the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience and blending their grating selves together i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope clowning at the absent audience the play made you understand theater people this movie just makes you want to choke them br br perhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience les miz miss saigon instead of relating to other characters started here but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie br br a chorus line is pure schlock
<START> i love watching early colour films you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey br br margaret rutherford dominates this movie her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure but i feel she was given her head rather too much she probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her if it gets a laugh leave it out she does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery arcati behaves like a retired headmistress we'll really put our backs into it the contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out br br just because all the actors are english apart from cummings the americans feel they have to use the words brit stiff lip and upper oh give it a rest the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risquÃ© remarks did he make love to you yes but very discreetly he was in the cavalry
<START> a somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of abraham lincoln's early years from director john ford concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder br br the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure and the film is well made but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with stephen douglas the obvious intent was to portray lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become but the result for me was that while i admired the portrayal it just wasn't as satisfying as i think it could have been with a greater scope br br in the role of abraham lincoln we have henry fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength fonda's performance includes some gangly mannerisms' and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt br br the supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of ford's regular supporting cast sometimes referred to as his stock company but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actors in hollywood bond has appeared in more of the afi top 100 films than any other actor both the original and revised list he has also appeared in 11 best picture nominees br br the film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in to kill a mockingbird where it would be done even better than it is here even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film
<START> picking up right after the moscow showdown of supremacy this is bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight 115 min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid paris marocco and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert ludlum imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that's so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in '63 director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard
<START> this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable br br the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the 50's these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating why isn't sam sheppard in jail the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and sheppard was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he exonerated br br i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include hurricane the thin blue line and breaker morant in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended br br 8 10
<START> there are no reasons to watch this movie should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill like that would ever happen then get this movie from the video shop if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk go figure but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie claudia udy showing her chest sadly no other reason than that
<START> i watched the un aired episodes online and i was so sad that the show won't be back it had the best cast of mature talented actors and an amazing chemistry it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life towards the end the show became engaging sexy and highly watchable of course some of the story lines are not realistic so what the characters are all likable and you root for them the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites sex and the city and felicity big kudos to all the cast note to abc execs nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results the show audience will mostly record it i've been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with reality tv or teenage oriented shows why to get a mature thoughtful well acted material we have to switch to hbo or fx i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers
<START> monstervision was a show i grew up with from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one the only joe bob briggs the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive in memories to ever come outside of the drive in br br without a doubt the best late night television ever if you didn't stay up you were missing out br br i know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they belong monstervision question did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of the swarm q br br long live monstervision
<START> well not yet at least br br it's not listed in the worst 100 br br so let's all team up and put it in it's rightful place br br this is truly a bad movie and i liked ishtar
<START> nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too this is not great cinema but i was most entertained given most films these days this is high praise indeed
<START> several posters have quoted renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera the short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so at this stage of her career bergman couldn't get arrested in 1949 she left hollywood to make a picture in europe fell for director roberto rossellini and never looked forward after five turkeys in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year after making this for renoir she was back where she belonged and with an oscar to boot for anastasia this is one of three movies that renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than the golden coach which isn't hard and about even with french can can renoir probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and renoir picked two doozys in jean marais and mel ferrer solid mahogany in both cases the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but renoir is content to give it a once over lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up in its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period les grandes manouvres which is no bad thing all in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress
<START> after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat serling continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight zone' in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode 'the sixteen millimeter shrine' is one of the more understated episodes focusing on an aging movie star's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes because of this approach the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story br br both the leads ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent shine in their performances the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly fortunately lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past it's a situation most can sympathise with and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character she is a prima donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her such as the disastrously withered co star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were it is somewhat surprising then that she is rewarded with a happy ending it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen what is not clear at the beginning however is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment as it turns out trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be br br 'the sixteen millimeter shrine' gets better with each viewing the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past even though we can never return except in the twilight zone
<START> this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate activated without a human computer where did the goa'uld ra's race come from how many are there br br the first episode has a retired jack o'neill spelled with 2 ls recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis a powerful goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial then daniel's wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen br br it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams in which jack's team will be sg 1 which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to chulak a goa'uld homeworld to rescue daniel's wife and another one captured at abydos named ska'ra they get captured and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a jaffa named teal'c first prime of apophis saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sg 1 br br that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa'uld called the tok'ra in which samantha's dad becomes a member the asgard a cute little race in which we see thor most often he's jack's buddy and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times br br the show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the ancients season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben browder as cameron mitchell the new leader of sg 1 and claudia black as vala maldoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team br br very well produced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you don't want to miss unlock the gate and step through you won't regret it
