<START> this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ok it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun i saw many similarities between this and 'creature with the blue hand' aka the bloody dead and they do have the same director scotland yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done there's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid and there's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance there's a monk and how anyone identifies this thing as a monk is beyond me it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood more of a klan member of a different color than a monk there's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight a nifty trick right there this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch 7 out of 10 not bad
<START> conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie there are occasional exceptions but this is not one of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 dalmatians
<START> i must be that one guy in america that didn't like this movie i guess this just wasn't my style or something i just don't see what's so fascinating about it this was barely entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history br br it's about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about mafias drug trade criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie don't forget good storytelling
<START> i found this to be a charming adaptation very lively and full of fun with the exception of a couple of major errors the cast is wonderful i have to echo some of the earlier comments chynna phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager at 27 she's just too old and yes it does show and lacks the singing chops for broadway style music vanessa williams is a decent enough singer and for a non dancer she's adequate however she is not latina and her character definitely is she's also very strident throughout which gets tiresome br br the girls of sweet apple's conrad birdie fan club really sparkle with special kudos to brigitta dau and chiara zanni i also enjoyed tyne daly's performance though i'm not generally a fan of her work finally the dancing shriners are a riot especially the dorky three in the bar br br the movie is suitable for the whole family and i highly recommend it
<START> reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel there are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews simply put it is a hammed up over acted chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending br br while many characters are mis cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them the worst by far is paltrow i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles but here she is abominable she is self conscious nasal slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her an extremely disappointing effort though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film
<START> paul armstrong is a liberal scottish born professor of law at harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie's murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair br br at first all goes well sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon materialises earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanie's murder if earl will murder his parents just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrong's wife herself a lawyer who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape br br just cause is an example of the auto cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa gavras's music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the swamplands of the american south ed harris' characterisation of sullivan as a bible quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro's character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause br br there is a postscript just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes br br the trouble with this style of film making by numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film connery and harris were to act together in another better film the rock the following year br br there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie anti death penalty anti racist and critical of heavy handed policing the second half looks more like the work of a die hard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency 4 10
<START> will smith is one of the best actors of all time i don't know how he does it i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head amazing and sad all at the same time thanks again will you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie you cannot miss a thing make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle well worth the money that you will pay to watch it don't wait for it to come on tv
<START> a spaceship returns from mars about a couple of months earlier a 4 person expedition had been sent to the red planet most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there the picture is saddled by inane melodramatic dialog typical of many sci fi efforts of the fifties sixties note for example how the ship's commander mohr tells another crew member to 'stay there' for no reason as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem later the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside the two he ordered to stay say 'no way' and follow out i didn't have high hopes for the expedition's success by this point there's much talk of 'ears twitching' and hugging a freeze ray gun named 'cleo' short for cleopatra of course it would at least be pretty funny unintentionally if the story didn't drag br br there's a very slow pace to the whole thing the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship's window portals which change color from red to blue commenting on what they see as they do outside actually exploring the martian landscape advertised as filmed in 'cinemagic ' usually resembles animation cut outs or drawings shot through an orange red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process but i don't think it fools anyone over 10 years old the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista oh okay br br i was amused by some of the astronauts' actions as they begin to explore right off the bat they test their freeze gun on a plant killing it just for the hell of it then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider rat monster nice going lady look up next time no wonder the 'intelligence' on mars gets upset and doesn't mind that one of the lower lifeforms a giant amoeba attacks the explorers the acting isn't too impressive mohr especially had a very annoying technique saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out reminded me of it the terror from beyond space the ending is fairly anti climactic don't expect any huge revelations beyond the 'no more expeditions' with freeze guns named cleo
<START> i simply love this movie i also love the ramones so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place there isn't a lot of critical praise to give this film either you like it or you don't i think it's a great cult movie
<START> i'm still new to the krimi genre and the only one i've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'the dead eyes of london' which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me if i'd seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while the college girl murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style the film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack this poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison and then has them put back in jail as the title suggests it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims there's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip br br of course with a plot like that this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue in cheek vibe to the film which does bode well with the plot the fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly although this isn't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested the atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at of course the film is based on an edgar wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra 'something' you cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax overall college girl murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended
<START> as an animated film from 1978 this is pretty good generally well above the standard of the days when disney hadn't done anything good in years and tolkien cared little for disney anyway it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work applying cinematic techniques with relative success the much maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well especially with the ringwraiths and the opening narration however it is so drastically overused possibly as a money saving technique that it detracts from the overall effect the same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the prancing pony br br as for the adaptation of the story it's actually quite good we lose little bits here and there minor details such as the old forest and tom bombadil the gaffer and the sackville bagginses we compress a few characters such as revising legolas as one of elrond's household and an old friend of aragorn's but that's a rather wise decision for film in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the elves and middle earth's vast history in film you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way nothing critical is truly lost here and although i have minor quibbles about some of the changes i'm generally pretty happy with it br br if only the dratted writers had managed to remember saruman's name he's frequently referred to as aruman a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly named sauron it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadn't misheard it it's also annoying that boromir is a bloody stage viking and irritable from the start however gandalf is excellent and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent if only john hurt weren't too old to play aragorn i love his voice br br of course with the film ending at the midpoint of the story there's a vast disappointment built in what makes it far far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the rankin bass crew on the sequel that they were permitted to do return of the king after butchering the hobbit remains a huge mystery they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling for all its faults this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision
<START> since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80's elvira cassandra peterson has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror bad monster movies while ms peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures covering a wide variety in genres it was her tv character elvira that brought her the most fame part of her charm Â and respect from the fans Â lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous unlike many other big name actors actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their early work i've seen only bits pieces of her tv performances but her cameo role in ghoultown's recent tribute song mistress of the dark really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video over the years elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid 80's came around br br and in 1988 after films like fright night and terrorvision incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv work it finally happened elvira mistress of the dark the motion picture now i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film a few years ago i did manage to watch elvira's haunted hills made in 2001 but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much was it really that forgettable or should i give it another watch i actually really do feel like re watching it now as this first elvira film from '88 really convinced me though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script there really is no way to deny it cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy she also co wrote the screenplay br br when elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt she never heard of before she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas out to claim her rightfully inherited money she travels to a quiet new england town but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her often unintentionally provocative behaviour to make things worse her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected a rundown mansion a cookbook and a poodle but what she doesn't know and her evil uncle vincent albot does is that her great aunt was a witch and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable and if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe book then rest assured you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face br br it's surprising how a script rigged together with boob jokes witty one liners movie references inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story simple of course but coherent while other movies heavily relying on gag like situations often make you loose track of the story completely like the naked gun films for example this film doesn't a lot of horror comedies were being produced during the 80's but not a lot of them actually worked let alone a horror spoof that doesn't derail at some point killer party although i'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale or becomes too tedious too quickly saturday the 14th although elvira is more comedy than horror it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot including a real honest to god witch hunt and elvira's very own burn at the stake moment br br i'm telling you there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already when daniel greene's name appeared daniel who oh yes i recognized his name and later on his dim witted macho face how can one not forget daniel greene once you've seen atomic cyborg aka fists of steel but if you haven't seen atomic cyborg then i'm sorry but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one and on a side note i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better
<START> very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression cross eyed is a rare gem the writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate the script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but commit to ernie as a character very funny stuff despite the tiny budget adam jones manages to give the film a serious look he's not messing around when it comes to making a good movie i can't wait to see what he comes up with next this guy can make people laugh and think that's special
<START> this norwegian movie is so crap the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so wannabe hollywood the only actor who did a ok job was haavard lilleheie 3 10 if you want a really good norwegian movie watch buddy great actors and a feelgood story 9 10
<START> ghost story the new house is a terrific horror story this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot remember him from the early family series family affair in the 1960s this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors and as the main characters in the story i saw this recently and i was so scared if you are alone i would not recommend that you watch this this story is terrific no gore or curse words but very scary barbara parkins played the young bride david birney played her husband both actors were very good in their parts if you like scary fun terrifying ghost stories then you will like this little gem i gave this a high rating i highly recommend this story
<START> this movie is pretty cheesy but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well br br the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie br br i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran sure it's not all that well done but the premise is not at all bad br br tom
<START> gandhi my father is like viewing a book chapter by chapter you read it with your eyes and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter kasturba gandhi so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely the title misleads though its as much a movie about mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son as its about harilal and his mother and akshaye khanna and shefali chayya do full justice to their respective roles br br such movies are like leap years they come after only so much time br br gandhi my father is also about an internal struggle which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken br br watch it if you like quality cinema
<START> in order to hold the public's attention for three hours we were treated not so much to a family's romp through four generations and 120 years of hungarian history as to sexual liaisons with a sister a sister in law and other adulteries oh yes there was also a totally gratuitous rape having said all this the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual thanks to jennifer ehle
<START> i've always liked fred macmurray andÂalthough her career was tragically cut shortÂi think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you getÂa mediocre movie experience br br skid johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skid's a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom ah yesÂit's the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon br br stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it's difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and s l o w direction just don't give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesn't ring true br br this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours
<START> just caught it at the toronto international film festival this is a good story told in a compelling way the handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes in a documentary style not a blair witch style joel schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping film br br the actors were strong particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film boz
