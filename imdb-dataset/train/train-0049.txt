<START> well i'll be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my daughter sally field 1991 in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a well inspired one well handled and well done nana patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time but she hasn't lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age br br all in all a nice watch
<START> ripoff of a dozen better films particularly steven martin's la story which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his then girlfriend playing his girlfriend in the film br br yes naive boys and girls 20 dates is a mockumentary although i am not absolutely certain that was myles berkowitz's intent when he started my impression is that he started the project semi seriously then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous as a result the whole thing has an uneasy cheap and insincere feeling about it br br as someone smartly pointed out the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on myles and yet they appear in the film which would be impossible as it would require a consent form it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses albiet not famous ones excepting tina carrere they are simply too obviously pretty polished thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians br br mr berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress instead of utilizing a variety of believable women which might have made the premise even in a mockumentary more believable and funnier he also skates over what is probably his real world problem and which is that both the movie character and the real world myles berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed his real life imdb credits are practically non existent excepting this film even in the world of the movie his ex wife divorced him for never being employed i think the viewer let alone mr berkowitz's real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the us in a luxury apartment driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he doesn't seen to have any source of income whatsoever is he drug dealer living off his rich parents no clue br br you can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny 20 dates is painfully embarrassingly un funny mr berkowitz's idea of a joke is to have his character while on restaurant dates announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation the worst kind of childish potty humor br br it is not very surprising to discover that mr berkowitz never made a film before 20 dates and in the last 8 years has not made a single film appeared as an actor in anyone else's film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind my gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by elie the gangster money man who appears off camera but more likely by mr berkowitz's affluent parents or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards whichever it was we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see myles berkowitz or any of his creative efforts ever again hallelujah
<START> i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian chris rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid 50's white mans body he doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community
<START> a true wholesome american story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural west virginia coal mining town after the launch of sputnik in 1957 br br through trial tribulations and perseverance beyond belief they are ultimately able to achieve their goals br br jake gyllenhaal as the leader of the group is excellent in the title role as his motivating science teacher laura linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top br br there is a standout supporting performance by chris cooper a head miner who wants his son to follow in his footsteps but gradually comes around at film's end br br what makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever it is the epitome of an american story that is well done br br besides the science angle we have the father son disagreement football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining and the loving spirit of family br br why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times
<START> i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player i thought i'd have a good laugh since i've played d d for half my life i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching br br finished it later and i should have just left it off at the soft core gay clown porn in the beginning no they run the gamut of fart jokes cum jokes incest racism dressing up as kkk this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d d br br no wonder it looks like the real d d wouldn't let them use their game who'd want their name attached to this
<START> men of honor features cuba gooding jr in what is probably his best performance to date he plays carl brashear a man of towering courage and heroism he's a poor dirt farmer from the south who wants to become a navy diver but has problems because of his race the head of the diving school played by robert deniro is a racist redneck that nonetheless grows to respect brashear the film is about how brashear has to concur the nearly insurmountable odds not once but twice the performances are what make this film special gooding is great and deniro the best actor in movie history gives a towering performance his best dramatic work in years charlize theron gives another solid performance as deniro's much younger wife the film lays on the patriotism a little too strong though no where near the level it was in the patriot and a few of the characters are just one dimensionally bad hal holbrook's mr pappy is just so evil but the film is a rarity among films today it's uplifting and uncynical a wonderful film
<START> i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a downer now some of you may not have watched hilary duff's 'raise your voice' but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in 'brave new girl' holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory in 'raise your voice' terri wants to go to a conservatory in l a don't remember the name of the conservatory there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester it's really funny how these two films are alike i personally like 'brave new girl' better than 'raise your voice' though
<START> i don't remember seeing another murder mystery movie as bad as this this movie about a medical examiner who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car accident has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama i remembered seeing this movie on pax a tv station notable for dishing out low budgeted and campy made for tv movies such as this one tv movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen but this movie sure hit all sour tastes the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making receipe for murder a great tv movie the title does offer some suspense br br so if you want a good recipe don't watch this movie this movie alone can kill your tv appetite br br grade f
<START> no day passes without a new released computer animated movie so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre br br but it's because i am a big guy now and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children maybe up to 14 the story is quite simple and the actors are funny in a cute way without any crude or complex humour even the evil is lovely fluffy big cat with those funny teeth and the story has a happy end which was a small disappointment for me knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way but a great thing for children and apart from some fights nobody dies not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth several times which made a cartoony feeling br br the computer animation part is nice but nothing special apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics which means lots of work nevertheless br br there were some gags which made me smile i accept the creators tried to satisfy those grownups but they are hard to spot and in my opinion better left unnoticed since it does not feel to fit into the story br br overall it's a nice movie but it's rather in the ideal world and fluffy animals for children disney cliche if you don't hate cute animals making funny things watch it at least once
<START> a different look at horror the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good the protagonist marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else the concept was more original than most direct to video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all i'd recommend it for renting but not for theater goers
<START> the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema without so many commonplaces in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence
<START> ok here is my personal list of top nicktoons shows as in today br br 1 all grown up spongebob squarepants br br 2 my life as a teenage robot br br 3 invader zim br br 4 catscratch rugrats br br notice a word with only capital letters that means this is the nick show i'm going to talk about br br catscratch is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats mr blik gordon and waffles who get into weird and really surreal situations from attempting to join human kimberely's slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship this is one nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later the theme song is catchy and memorable voice actors including wayne knight from the seinfield franchise brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities the stories are enjoyable fans' episodes would be king of all root beer and gordon's lucky claw and the humor is all done in some style of earthworm jim br br so in conclusion catscratch is one of the nicktoons series like invader zim and mlaatr which becomes very very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less
<START> when i say doctor who you might conjure up an image of tom baker or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison when i say james bond you ll almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan but when i say sgt bilko absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor and that s the problem with this film version you ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
<START> one of those classics held up next to deep throat and behind the green door br br sure it was clever but the female lead isn't that attractive and sex isn't that hot but if not for this film porn would not have blossomed into what it is today br br harry reems was the ron jeremy of his day worth a look if you're a fan
<START> this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet it made the rm sons of provo look like well done films it was supposed to be funny from what i was told the best part was the best actor in the movie travis eberhard if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made he ruled br br 10 it wasn't funny 9 it was beat 8 it had thurl big t bailey who's character made no sense 7 it was made in provo 6 it didn't make fun of brokeback 5 it had larry h miller in it 4 it was the 1st movie clint howard wasn't funny in 3 gary coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 they should have cast at surreal life auditions 1 it was made by halestorm entertainment
<START> i think this still is the best routine there are some others like rock's bring the pain and allen's men are pigs that are hilarious damon waynes last stand is also funny in a tearful way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect just long enough to last 20 years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if you're bloated thanks eddie god bless
<START> i was thirteen years old when i saw this movie i expected a lot of action since escape from new york was 16 rated in germany i entered the movie as fallback it was so boring afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access it is more then 20 years ago but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film this is a soft porno for schoolboys undressing bo derek and painting her with color nice but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her
<START> for the record i am not affiliated with the production in any way br br hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date over 7 seasons this is the last they have produced some 50 or so episodes br br this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy br br by their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improve br br i did find it difficult to dip into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes improving on the characters over the original br br the whole experience includes an excellent web site blooper reels a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat br br if you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for you br br if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think this is the one
<START> the super sexy b movie actress has another bit part as future goodfellas star ray liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb she plays marion has only one line of dialog well one word of dialog actually she shouts out joe as ray's character is violating poor pia zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler this movie is so bad though it becomes funny hilarious at times the guys at mystery science theater 3000 would love this check out the hysterical scene at the end where pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly pia's character is freaking out pia plays an aspiring hollywood screenwriter in this pia zadora as a screenwriter yeah right pia can barely talk let alone write pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role but who cares the real star is the hot and fresh glory annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion rock on glory
<START> 'intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery i'm a middle aged married father of two i'm quite functional in my personal and professional life still i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe and issues from which i am slowly recovering when these addicts and their families share their lives with me they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family br br the show unlike many others digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do as alice miller says the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started this digging is painful and difficult but worth it so much coverage of addiction fictional and non fictional seems to ignore the underlying issues often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self interest and now they can't stop not so addictions are about killing pain i can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives there are common themes and surprising exceptions many addicts have suffered miserable abuse some kids simply respond badly to divorce to those who think that addiction is an over reaction to a hardship i would just say that different people respond differently although some kids handle divorce well others like cristy in the show collapse in a heap on the floor and have their lives forever changed by the event br br for example last night's counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men she strips for cash for a 75 year old neighbor and lets men abuse her sound familiar to anyone the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest as they say even a stopped watch is right twice a day but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while until it's made your life miserable br br to the producers thank you for making the show for digging into the past for the follow ups also the graphics the format and the theme music are brilliant br br to the addicts thank you for your courage to share whether or not you have helped yourself you have helped me
