<START> i first saw this movie here in the u k in december 1989 when central tv broadcast it i still have the video tape although worn out over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it br br anyway i remember coming home that night grabbing a christmas tipple switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a 'christmas ghost story' even now i remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on end br br i have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that i think those people get scared by friday 13th and the like stalk and slash rammel which are laughable this is a 'traditional' ghost story there is no big budget action or special effects no swearing no blood no gratuitous sex scenes no chainsaws or guns etc so how refreshing it's atmospheric if you like chilling horror well written well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere this is the movie for you i like the original horrors only last night i saw the original haunting and that is a superb movie very atmospheric again and so is the woman in black the end of the movie differs to the book but still very good i recommend it try it you will like it if you like traditional ghost stories so turn off the lights turn up the fire lock the doors grab a drink and enjoy
<START> gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinema br br there are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see special the figure of toni sabine timento is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this coolneÃ is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia hummer is not inside of the laws of society the is outside and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems the stupid break with conventions the criminal fascination throw it all away and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side there the parents who are the pendant to the two girls the have a car a hotel suite the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of them br br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic story has nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an introversion way there is no exhibition in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes away br br okay the film will end in the german way of coolneÃ rubbish here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment where is happening something else and this moment was important he is more than german coolneÃ and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
<START> so why does this show suck unfortunately that really is the only question because there is no doubt that it does br br for those unfamiliar with the premise of the show the doomed to be shortlived series cavemen focuses on a number of neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day america and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for geico insurance the concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully br br i had to think about it for awhile but then the tagline from the commercials something to the effect of we're not that much different from you provided me with the key to the show's suckiness even though cavemen neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity the title characters of this show it turns out are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks br br maybe its my background as a game writer rather than a soulless hack committee based writer from california but this show had so much potential and none of it has been realized to start with the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us br br what could conceivably be funny for example about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks why would they play prosaic games like squash when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears a show like this could write itself and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring br br another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities yawn this has been done so many times before and never more drearily than this and as noted previously neanderthals really are a different species so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark br br responses are welcome including those from anyone who wants to tell me why i'm wrong i'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that i have thus far been unable to br br michael j varhola skirmisher online gaming magazine

<START> i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on me br br i first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987 my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it for an re project i think we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema little did we know what we were about to experience to this day i still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year br br i think it served it's purpose in my case
<START> if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time then this is the documentary for you admitedly i didn't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism but that was enough for me maybe the rest is even better br br i wonder how long it's going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies perhaps game shows based on self mutilation might be nice br br i already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen i don't need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment
<START> contains spoiler from both original and movie versions br br i am a huge fan of notre dame de paris musical i also read book this summer and i watched movie today in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6 3 imdb point first scenes were good but i actually waited for theaters scene directly from book but it was normal but when esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong they don't even kiss in book even in musical br br and there were huge gap why esmeralda being judged by sorcerer in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word phoebus wait there were a phoebus weren't there in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more the creators made quasimodo's love to show around and they even canceled frollo's love but notre dame was frollo his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts and not mentioning phoebus not mentioning love of frollo not mentioning jehan brother of frollo not mentioning mother of esmeralda maybe it is ok the storyline would have chopped much they even not mentioned the real story another ps frollo wasn't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold he was stuck in science and religion br br finally don't watch this movie it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece and if you have watched it before read the book god have mercy on you you must read to book immediately br br this movie is worse than hunchback of notre dame ii the animated movie spend your time with watching notre dame de paris musical enough said

<START> this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didn't know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn't believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it can't get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie
<START> imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on to make it easier for her to fall asleep that i came across it yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an 'early night' br br anyway this must surely be a rather unusual idea to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries' most appreciated literary artists georges remy a k a hergÃ© br br i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in hergÃ©'s life and i can tell you that i will a s a p get the few that i don't have of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them as has my view about what albums are my favourites but this adds at least one more dimension to them
<START> this film was pretty good i am not too big a fan of baseball but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love determination heart etc br br danny glover joseph gordon levitt brenda fricker christopher lloyd tony danza and milton davis jr are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport the plot was believable and i love the message william dear and the guys put together a great movie br br most sports films revolve around true stories or events and they often do not work well but this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there br br 10 10
<START> stilted stagy strange and opaque if visually striking a wannabe erotic fantasy really boring way too much male nudity including father son incest and just a sort of shameless pointlessness i will confess however that certain passages of dialogue taken on their own terms do have a lulling haunting quality
<START> the japanese cyber punk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that i've seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining meatball machine is no exception br br the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts takes control of their bodies turns them into necroborgs and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said parasites the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of human will vs the parasite's control over their physical bodies br br meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo as most cyber punk films are and for good reason there are definitely some thematic parallels though the films are definitely different there's plenty of fun splattery moments in meatball machine and the creature borg fx are definitely the high point a mixture of tetsuo meets gwar that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films meatball machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyper kinetic cyber punk films with a healthy dose of splatter this one's for you 7 10
<START> i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary and i waited a good while for this to come through the pipes my local video chain and it was worth the wait i like a good documentary special interest piece but this was definitely a heartfelt honest and nostalgic if you will look back on adolescent life the imagination of a child is fascinating and that's where a great story begins rent it or buy it if you like a good humorous and all around entertaining documentary mr stein and company have definitely come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder productions of bank hold ups and gay rings that turn people gay from one glance they all seem rather successful in they're respectful fields and it was good to know that they are all still good friends the dvd has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries and it features a number of darren's most notable productions including crazy news
<START> prom night is a title only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen this movie takes place in an oregon town where donna brittany snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years she and her friends arrive at the prom which is taking place in a grand hotel and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives little does anyone know a man from donna's past who has haunted her for years is also at the prom and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her br br i'm a fan of the original prom night so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie but i have to admit i was quite disappointed prom night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have and that is predictability there are absolutely no surprises here and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times often better before what does this equate to for the audience boredom unless of course you have never seen any horror movies or are part of the pre teen crowd but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen the plot is simplistic but the entire script is void of any type of surprise twist atmosphere or anything and this really really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into it all just seemed very bland br br a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg 13 slasher movie as well and i understand what they are saying but i don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore take carpenter's halloween for example little to no on screen violence but still an extremely frightening and effective movie you don't need gore to make a film scary but even had prom night been gratuitously violent which it is not it is very tame it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with the tension and suspense here is mild at best and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations and was correct about 99 of the time our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them and their by the numbers demises are routine and careless br br i will point out a few things i did like about this movie though because it wasn't completely useless the cinematography is really nice and everything was very well filmed and fairly stylish among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable there were a few that were kind of clever the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold however predictable the unfolding may be as for the acting it's mediocre at best brittany snow plays the lead decently but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent johnathan schaech plays the villain and is probably the most experienced performer here but even he isn't that impressive however i did like the character he played which was a nice change from the typical 'masked stalker' type killer we see a lot as far as the ending goes the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti climactic br br overall prom night was a disappointment everything was very by the numbers routine and predictable which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie there were a few neat moments but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere and had little plot development nor believable characters i'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video or rent the original instead because there are absolutely no surprises here some may find a little entertainment in it but it was far too predictable for my tastes i expected better and left the theater very disappointed 3 10

<START> no artful writeup here because it doesn't deserve one not an art film not even one of those 'hidden' gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films br br just pack it into the christmas boxes and dispose of quickly
<START> final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas shooting people who shoot people then he's off to malta where he shoots more people he gets locked up many times for shooting people then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy who is dressed like a monk there is a boat chase and joe don winds up in jail again finally joe don with the help from elaine from seinfeld kill the bad guy blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare all this and a catchy theme song just like mitchell
<START> this movie is a lot of fun what makes it great especially are two things one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and superpowers there's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr furious's desires there's a boatload of talent here i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed but this movie is a lot of fun and kind of sweet
<START> dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind but now he's fixed lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one goldblum who's supposed to have something going with lane's sister barkin br br with what anyone could consider an all star supporting cast burt reynolds gabriel byrne kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor can't help this plot as dreyfuss proves he's not fixed and tries to kill just about everyone in sight br br you know it's not like you didn't know what was coming the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out but i'll save you all the trouble skip this movie br br the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies the real let down for me wasn't just the terrible plot but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie although we hear about her all through the movie even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on br br 3 out of 10 stars
