<START> death lends a hand is one of the pivotal early episodes of columbo that helped define the show for the next thirty years it marks the first of robert culp's four appearances three as a murderer playing much the same role in each show br br in this case culp plays brimmer the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate mr kennicut is having an affair although she is brimmer decides not to tell kennicut in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates she reacts badly to this suggestion an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face because he is wearing a large ring the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her br br there are some really priceless moments in this episode one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm reading although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring columbo being columbo he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple minded man who gets excited by the lifeline going over the mound of the moon or some equally ridiculous palm reading mumbo jumbo br br another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around again columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer br br and there's another where columbo says to kennicut in front of brimmer that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him without directly accusing him so he rather cruelly but understandable in the circumstances decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid which of course he does all the while the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation it's only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut not shown on screen br br i won't reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights but let's just say there's a potato involved br br a really really good episode possibly the very best of the first series if you liked this then you'll like double exposure too also featuring robert culp
<START> this movie is wonderful the writing directing acting all are fantastic very witty and clever script quality performances by actors ally sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky really original and heart warmingly unpredicatable the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production
<START> the critics are dumb this movie is funny and smart i loved this movie a lot why does everyone hate this movie so much i wish people would love this movie more than they don't ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie i don't see you people out there making movies like them so people should just watch it and not comment it i like this movie it is ok through it all there are parts were it get's dumb but at least they made it jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens but this is better than that i can't believe this was rated so low
<START> one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began the members of the summer of love culture at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life whatever that meant for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance their's was the culture of wonderland a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority values and the establishment is the world that the film captures br br the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american house apart once the battles were over we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies part biker part hippie part crook all outcast no ideology to express just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing ron billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope they talk of love and behave violently they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten they steal from everyone br br holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti matter like sex and drugs and rock roll when the lab technicians get bored and move on br br the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant that story was told in boogie nights this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era
<START> eh not a particular good slasher flick so so acting effects decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack br br there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes apart from that there's a lot of characters wandering around not realizing what's going on or chasing after red herrings more killing of time than of people there are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer not partial to any one implement the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well the identity isn't revealed towards the end and motive is pretty thin and we really don't care br br supposedly the movie takes place around christmas but this isn't a major factor one scene gets lit by christmas lights that's about it br br the movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time at least on the videotape i watched some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes the ending should have been stronger than it was we think we realize what happened although there's a chance something else did
<START> ooof this one was a stinker it does not fall 'somewhere in between star wars and thriller' thats for sure in all actuality it falls somewhere between the cracks of a wham video and captain eo only with not as big of a budget and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying simon le bon preens front and center while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from roxy music's last 3 albums brief clips from barbarella add nothing avoid at all costs however i liked the part when they played 'hungry like the wolf' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes i mean they aren't singing 'eye of the tiger' or 'hungry like the tiger' it's a wolf whatever a dvd of duran duran's '80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia's sake
<START> when i saw this movie i couldn't believe my eyes where these hilarious creatures dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth really meant to be scary or where they designed to have a good laugh i sincerely hope so if you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them better dragging them across the screen the whole was rather funny than scary and i had a good time watching the movie because i was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part it is one big joke from beginning to end and i believe this movie belongs into a new category so unbelievable crappy you'll be laughing from beginning to end i'm not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things
<START> don't get me wrong the movie is beautiful the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic however it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done br br bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph loss and gain it was balanced br br disney's edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us they made predators evil they made walruses evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive br br i am all for preventing global warning but this was over the top political and environmental junk br br that's another thing i went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at home br br if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the bbc's planet earth series it is better lessons better sound and if you have blu ray better picture quality
<START> i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting who'da thunk it br br parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films br br a movie like this never gets its dues from close minded males it's too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting br br and its depiction of contemporary l a and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made l a look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie br br i won't divulge the plot but as a long time and hard core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyable br br this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however br br if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc you'll enjoy this br br a first rate job all around even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence
<START> what's happening to rgv he seems to repeat himself in every movie has he run out of creative ideas if he has time to take a back seat went to see the movie with great anticipation of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original i knew it wouldn't the promos said it all but even then i thought it would be a great rgv treat after all isn't he the same guy who directed sathya and company or is he i have my doubts after watching aag i am not going to talk about the plot or the story as most of it is taken from the original if you are really dying to go and see this one you could play a fun game with friends identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own so veeru becomes heero how corny is that guess heeru wouldn't sound that great ajay devgan is quite a disaster as heero the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in company sounds fake the chemistry between heero and gunghroo nisha kothari doesn't exists at all in fact the more charming nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes this reaches a peak by the end raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others he is a guy to watch in the future i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as babban he looks like a caricature of gabbar singh there is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl the only performance that really stood out was mohan lal as inspector narasimha i am afraid i don't have the patience to write more
<START> i was interested in seeing this movie because i knew it was christian based the director had a good idea intentions when making this movie but it could have been better i can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life however i didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive mean and rude the main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him they weren't understanding at all and they used god as a reason to explain their behaviors the main character nor anyone else didn't know if the ex girlfriend was divorced still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with his friends were suppose to be christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not so many times we do things in life where we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him the ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name address and phone number she seemed to be the stalker she didn't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself god is love and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god doesn't care about true love only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with we all make mistakes it's all about what steps you take to make amends like i said the movie had potential but i was tired of the one sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so called well meaning friends this movie didn't hold true to the christian belief of love but i give it a c for its effort
<START> ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles particularly as shakespeare's othello critically lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin unfortunately the witty banter comes off as self conscious here and the backstage business is overripe miklÃ³s rÃ³zsa also won an oscar for his score and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress when theatrical colman breathlessly addresses her she asks him what are ya some kind of nut otherwise this scenario is awfully obvious surprisingly draggy and not very funny 1 2 from
<START> the story centers around barry mckenzie who must go to england if he wishes to claim his inheritance being about the grossest aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great nation of ours there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue the songs of barry mckenzie barry crocker are highlights
<START> yes kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity here we have shaq as a rapping genie yes a rapping genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him so yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o'neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy the main plot of the film involves this kid played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great grandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom box then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the shaq genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady gang type absentee father br br this really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies i e the two chances in life speech from father to son but it's shaquille o'neill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all his plot line involves him when not getting the over talky treatment from capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career on top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box so is there a camp factor to the movie up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material one might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing i'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid but i'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq machine br br so if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker all the more fun to you hell it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel but if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's
<START> i was watching this with one of my friends who is a vampire freak and i was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists this film should be shown to prisoners of war yes it's that bad even john mccain wouldn't be able to sit through this so why the 3 10 rating because it had a vampire midget come on what's more entertaining than a vampire midget there's one scene in this film where john savage gets laid by saying i want to feel human again and the chick being the brainless stripper slut she is lets him feel human i wish i could feel human with jessica alba or megan fox this is a movie for stoners there is bright flashy objects and random movements all in all don't waste your money on this garbage i got it for free when i was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said free so in a way i didn't get ripped off but still
<START> what happens when you give a homeless man 100 000 as if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen the creators of reversal of fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment br br they take ted a homeless man in pasadena and give him 100 000 to see if he will turn his life around then with only the most cursory guidance and counseling they let him go on his merry way br br what are they trying to say money can't buy you happiness the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be or how about lift a man up it's more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude they took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain that's supposed to be entertainment they dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked what happens when you take down a stop sign
<START> it's a gentle easy going 1950s comedy kim novak belongs to a coven of witches in manhattan she puts a spell on neighbor jimmy stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him losing her powers see witches are permitted to have hot blood but not love elsa lanchester is novak's aunt also a witch jack lemmon is her brother ditto hermione gingold is the chief witch and ernie kovacks is sidney redlich an author who specializes in writing about witches br br i described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else everything is so smooth and polished from the set decoration through wardrobe and plot to the performances and direction take the character of ernie kovacks he's referred to as a drunk and a nut and here's how the movie demonstrates these traits he asks for a second drink and though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen his hair is a bit long and tousled that's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut nothing is out of place everything is tidy and free of dust the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely scuffed br br and the zodiac club where the witches hang out it's called a low dive yet it's a clean dark place with polite waiters a quintet of musicians neatly dressed clientÃ¨le and potted plants against bare brick walls that is not my idea or yours of a low dive not even for greenwich village in 1958 my idea of a dive in greenwich village is julius's or the white horse tavern or the san remo or the swing rendezvous a now defunct lesbian hangout the zodiac club is a high dive compared to these br br the kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards i mean kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet and she wears a lot of black clothes like the beatniks of the period did br br but never mind all that it's an enjoyable romantic comedy kim novak is effective as gillian who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden she has a strange beauty bulky and ethereal at the same time she glides rather than walks a wispy presence her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic french curves and jimmy stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim in the 1930s he usually played in light roles in the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use who could resist laughing when hermione gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of novak's spell it's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming richard quine directs the movie quietly without fireworks or special effects and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart when the siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with novak's startling eyes br br ernie kovacks in the 1950s was a well known television personality there was never anything quite like the ernie kovacks show before or after it brings the word surrealism to mind he could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only bartok's concerto for orchestra as background and he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of percy dovetail an effete poet the credits kind of skip over the condoli brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys pete and conte were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles conte was later a member of doc severison's band on johnny carson's late show br br the third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy but it's never dull the whole film rolls along as neatly as van druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too
<START> i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a vh1 special i think where are they now and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky pigeon he played the male child ghost in this b horror horrible but i remember him from his character freddy on the silver spoons television show this flick's a major letdown there's nothing here it actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish i kept stopping it in boredom setting it aside and forgetting about it then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it obviously the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element the apparitions and obviously here that doesn't work i can't stand the male leads i kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines the situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb i guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh it's fairly good gore makeup there man i'm really reaching for a positive now huh the only other no budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home
<START> i actually really like what i've seen of this cartoon so far sure the animation isn't the best but frankly i'd rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply which was starting to happen more and more often it's only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it there's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black dot eyes in fact i think it's really cute as a kid i never thought scooby doo's design was particularly adorable but i think i might like it better know br br anyway shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not but i think he has the most potential for some depth sure the show doesn't center around the original mystery solving theme but that was just a tired old formula anyway don't get me wrong i'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery inc 's traditional pursuits which has been lacking as late but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard shaggy and scooby are still funny but no longer only comic relief they're still cowardly but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be shock intelligence they're the same old over eating slackers as ever but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle albert's inheritance br br i used to find most original scooby doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor also i never really like casey kasem as shaggy anyway so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people i still think billy west was the best though br br overall while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history still an achievement among other scooby incarnations
<START> the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible br br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i'm not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess it's not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don't listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don't be surprised if you cry too
