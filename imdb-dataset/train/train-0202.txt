<START> this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers br br the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake journalistic report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in it's production it is like a bad student film the story's horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could
<START> i rented this shortly after renting ben stein's expelled and thought it would interesting to compare them before i go further it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i'm prejudiced or not i'm trying to be objective for the record br br i tend to enjoy maher's hbo show now and then though i rarely think he's the source of the humor i don't really care for his stand up either but he makes some good points on the show now and again and i liked politically incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which i deem a negative because the very term sounds orwellian or at least fascist as for my religious views i'll say for simplicity's sake that i'm a non denom christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in br br that being said this a bad documentary for reasons that haven't been touched on yet by many reviewers though the ones mentioned are valid too the reason it's not convincing isn't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either it's just come on really which isn't a point just a question try david hume if you want a decent argument the reason this isn't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn't a clergyman there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with masters or doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring particularly in the fields of history anthropology or a host of others br br if one compares this to ben stein's expelled no intelligence allowed he'll find that stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors professionals clergy etc he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century's secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio political power it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the anne frank house i think this is a true orwellian head trip he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deaths which has had its share though far smaller than most without even including a basic view of the evidence perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism's miserable record of the 20th century alone br br another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner he picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd how difficult is that how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule it does not wow so people in cults think outside of the norm how enlightening to know this great work maher again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in br br beyond all that he's just not that funny here some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of context irreverent ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from maher will not be forthcoming much less convincing he spends most of his time bashing christians spouting inaccuracies and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn't allow to really answer his questions br br for the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves he touches on almost none of these i get the feeling that i could've responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing reeks of deck stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out
<START> i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension especially when landing yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets and gizmos dreamed up by the props department all in all an entertaining hour and a half my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young' man
<START> this was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many many times the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format as for judi dench she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars i always make a point to see judi dench in all her performances she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life i can only be grateful when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters good scripts and good acting the movie public needs heroes not deviant manikins who lack ingenuity and talent how wonderful to see old favorites like leslie caron olympia dukakis and cleo laine i would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment i congratulate the writer director producer and all those who did such a fine job
<START> while the original titillates the intellect this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities instead of intricate plot twists this so called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development worst of all replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four letter words leaving behind a stark but uninteresting taste br br there was promise unfulfilled promise the prospect of michael caine pulling off a patty duke like keller to sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing unfortunately this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation first by accepting the role in this horribly re scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude law's amateurish overacting br br if you haven't seen the classic original overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks hunt it down watch it and just enjoy a story and a half as for the remake pass on this insult to the original
<START> more tv movies ought to be made like this one i saw it way back in '93 when it was first on tv helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific giving very gritty and realistic performances weber was especially good turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester killer this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress the director also directed hoosiers which was somehow both formulaic and exciting but the direction in both of these works has the same stark simple realism that is so appealing if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting see it if you can the side story about hunt and fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story
<START> here's a gritty get the bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington he's three personalities here a down and out low key now drunk former mercenary then a loving father type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge br br the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico where kidnappings of children occur regularly at least according to the movie he becomes attached to the kid played winningly by the child actress of our day dakota fanning when fanning is kidnapped in front of him washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one beware this film is not for the squeamish br br this is stylish film making which is good and bad i liked it but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera work is one that could give you a headache i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view but it's the shaky camera not for all tastes br br besides the two stars there is the always interesting christopher walken in an uncharacteristically low key role and a number of other fine actors br br the film panders to the base emotions in all of us but it works
<START> this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff rather it's for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the run of the mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah ish this is such a wonderful movie you must see it semantics tho' she is right for once br br the story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along a journey that i believe most of us will come to recognize at some time a compassionate existentialist journey where we make amends fÃ¶r our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise br br acting is without faults cinematography likewise occasionally quite brilliant and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story br br a warm movie not excessively sentimental
<START> i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many times br br this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie it was as if i was looking at paintings many times which i think was the idea br br terrific movie story actors and cinematography full of profound emotions from every angle although i am not particularly fond of romance movies i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryder's plea to her father toward the end br br mr irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never better br br
<START> i saw this film at the rotterdam festival as did presumably all the other voters the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite round the twist but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states as i can't think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic poorly acted albeit by an amateur cast and prey to the subaltern mentality the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in all problems can be solved by leaving the island
<START> i had the opportunity to see this film debut at the appalachian film festival in which it won an award for best picture this film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble my favorite performances were from youssef kerkour justin lane and adam jones also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that i was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget the writer director adam jones who i believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction the audience loved this movie cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie definitely a must see
<START> i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since br br the plot has been well discussed so no need in going over it again the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings americans especially aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around i know i didn't br br this movie is funny touching sad all at the same time when ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding it's cringe inducing when karen calls tony brian as he attempts to kiss her it's heartbreaking when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black it's too funny for words br br and the music it's as good as any movie soundtrack i've heard in years i was dancing in the living room to all over the world br br every performance is absolutely perfect bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray a man who has had one too many bad trips stephen rea is perfect as tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him but all the actors are equally brilliant br br ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it it's a gem
<START> to be honest i didn't like executive decision which was obvious the template very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of art br br not only that the people moving in the film the term actors would be an insult for all other actors should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar it is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg the film is full of illogicalness e g use sleeping gas then don't use it then use it anyway which dropped my rating finally to the bottom br br you can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk
<START> well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i'll never get back on this piece of trash i heard someone online describe this movie's villains as subhuman cannibals and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent wrong the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch this movie isn't so controversial i've seen this level of gore in many films this movie plain sucks synopsis a blonde who thinks she's real hot but she isn't her admirer and her admirer's friend no i don't remember their names go into the woods their car breaks down they are warned to leave by a man named mark the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend admirer impales his foot whoops don't worry he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets impaled by nails after a nanosecond of coaxing the blond leaves to find help events ensue that i cannot remember during this and throughout the movie we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals even though all they are seen eating is intestines which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard unsuccessfully to work up tears then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can out think them mark the man who warned them to leave has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family then there is some shooting they leave the house the shooting continues then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them before he is shot we are shown an acid trip inspired scene of more killing the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them there's more killing the admirer professes his love for the blonde then a mysterious hand covers the camera what does that imply i don't know hopefully not a sequel
<START> i went and saw rivers and tides again today it's the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy's works this morning when i threw the coins i received 29 the abysmal water goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title i received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film again br br i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film he'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second time br br yesterday i thought that i'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar some of his work words are zen like his knowledge br br anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend setter go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film you've heard about from the hinter lands it's called rivers and tides br br
<START> this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a lumbering drama the scary music is excellent but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography sp and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different
<START> another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks also aptly yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non critically and black comedy also well worth consideration br br watch the whole thing all three series at the end all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel the detail and intricacies are staggering thoroughly post modern wickedly funny and startlingly tragic not for kids not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity thought provoking at once literal figurative and surreal in disturbing ways the blackest comedy i can recall br br and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see
<START> i agree with all the accolades i went through a box of tissues watching this film it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way br br the question i'm about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous br br this is the age of no animals were hurt in the production of this move iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation was it possible to fake these animal deaths or were these animals slaughtered for art
<START> there are some things i will never understand why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example similarly i will never understand this film and that is brilliant if you approach this film expecting an actual movie you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures take pitch for instance the most ineffectual camp unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms however it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever seriously this is no understatement the same can be applied to every other character bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of then again if santa's inter space recon station is real there is no chance she could have avoided him this long put simply if you haven't seen this movie you cannot consider yourself a serious buff the achingly funny characterisation acting concept and almost under the radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date if you're after pure laughter that is
<START> i strongly disagree with ctomvelu regarding jim belushi's talent i happen to like belushi very much admittedly i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john but jim has an on screen charm that has gotten him very far and he has developed it well over the years br br curly sue is one of his earlier films his weight is a giveaway ain't that true for most of us and i like the film yes it is touching and heartwarming so if you're into car chases explosions and gratuitous sex then you might want to pass on this one it is a warm film of three lost soles who find each other don't get me wrong i am all for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film but i also like a nice solid tale like this one br br and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performances the real star of this film is alisan porter who is absolutely adorable br br i don't know what happened to her career but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball agent parents herself should be shot you couldn't ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since br br another sad hollywood story
