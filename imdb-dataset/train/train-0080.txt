<START> what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that while perhaps lacking in substance still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction rounders and roadkill i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director it would be well worth watching and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of the plot focuses on the overly moral michael a man travelling across america looking for work he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife he's been mistaken for a killer named lyle but instead of doing the job he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway however his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up br br john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road he did it three years earlier with kill me again and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill it's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters the acting is largely very good with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role and getting a class support from lara flynn boyle j t walsh and of course dennis hopper who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it overall red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching it's thrilling throughout and you can't ask for much more than that
<START> this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons the only reason that i give this show a 9 10 is because of the unfortunate final season the only good part of the final season was the finale my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people's imaginations often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70's it is a rare show in that i liked every character with the exception of the final season too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny red's foot in your ass comments never got old nor did kelso's stupidity bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long too long even
<START> a film as bad as this should be withdrawn from all stores world wide so full of boring dull unimaginative characters and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice over for every action and feeling this film holds the record for the most challenging film i have ever watched as i had payed money to own it i felt a duty to see it through and how i regret it my head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless plot less lives a bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything are all frigid and worst of all have terrible dialogue throughout just mulling around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl boring so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and i was red with embarrassment that i'd thrown away Â£6 the dvd was on ebay the following day and i didn't make much of my money back avoid like the plague
<START> i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled enforcer deadpool was a bit weak in areas too but i still enjoyed it this one is one of my favorites of the series if nothing else for the great line of go ahead make my day this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong just think magnum force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me granted she is not to bad here but her character could have been so much better by someone else another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns i like guns as much as the next person but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds still very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies
<START> being a big fan of the other planet of the apes films i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton once again he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction even the ape makeup looks second rate which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor as if boogie nights wasn't proof enough i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche ridden screenplay i rented this dvd on a special 1 night and i still feel ripped off
<START> sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite t v shows of life d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school so far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage girl witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to she's funny smart outgoing witty and a lot more caroline rhea and beth broderick both fit the part very well as sabrina's aunts zelda the intelligent scientist and hilda the crazy wacky one make a perfect balance in sabrina's life though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years but that doesn't mean they weren't still good i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped it made sense and i loved it anyways
<START> this was another great tom berenger movie but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent
<START> i did not read anything about the film before i watched it by chance last saturday evening and then as i was watching it i felt the misery of lena and boesman into my bones i was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that i listened only partially to the dialogues my husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and i was sleepless under the impact of the film i wanted to wake him up just to say if i would ever vote for an oscar nomination it would be for these two actors i decided to wait until the next day then i read more about the film on imdb and was sad to learn that mr berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece i still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film in its concept and spirit the actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine no showing off well to the contrary displaying the true image of human depression sad but poignant
<START> a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers the mystery is whether or not jane graystone nancy coleman has amnesia the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr ingersoll a good doctor turned evil he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane coded information related to allied activities will she tell can she remember moroni olson as mr goodwin is convincing as an accomplice to massey the role played by john garfield as dr lewis is nothing short of disastrous he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents the movie is worth one look despite being a half spy and half gangster film and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters it's easy to forget this one amnesia is not necessary
<START> like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing the 1940s noir films but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past the term 'neo noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact john dahl's film on the other hand truly deserved to be described as such the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes james m cain would have appreciated it many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to and i'm not even that old movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past
<START> the child actors were annoying also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes decent death scenes though if not for the death scenes this movie would have a very disneyish feel to it br br the main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as she should have been if i was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual you can bet your arse i wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike br br overall i've seen worse i e it waits but it's nothing i would watch again or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you're an avid horror collector
<START> based on tom wolfe's satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs either melanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film this will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten 3
<START> i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep it's slow moving and the idea of a mid atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony apart from conrad veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to spill big time it even on one occasion woke me up br br but give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt he doesn't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly browns there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke
<START> twelve years ago production stopped on the slasher flick hot blooded since almost everyone on the set started dying now a couple of film students have decided to finish the film despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed well they're about to find out that some curses are real br br when scream was released every country seemed to want to cash in on its success even australia the concept which today has been done to death a slasher film within a slasher film was at the time relatively cool and original this movie was released right before urban legends final cut and scream 3 well not in the us but in australia so it felt like the first movie with this concept when urban legends 2 was released most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good the movie flopped disastrously now cut is not the best slasher flick ever and nor does it try to be it knows that it's a rip off and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story they've decided to rip off some 80s slasher flicks like nightmare on elm street as well and surprisingly enough this actually works the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer and instead of trying to scare the audience to death they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie spoiler ahead i mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene it makes no sense i tell you end of spoilers all in all cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip offs that never made it big i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel but i guess it simply came out too late br br suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous
<START> the story is somewhat stilted what with the main character's sudden reversals of fortune but leslie howard and bette davis's portrayals of philip carey the naÃ¯ve obsessed lover and mildred rogers the unworthy object of his affections raise this film considerably above standard melodrama br br sensitive cultured philip who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years later ashley wilkes the southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough reconstruction era philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before mildred enters the pictureÂhe doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he'll never make it as a painter it is perhaps this passivity these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he does br br although leslie howard is memorable today of human bondage is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy mildred may have a grating voice but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her one may also think she is on to something when she accuses philip of looking down on her for not being fine enough the scene in which philip and norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this br br most of the supporting characters are also effective particularly norah the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has mildred's beauty and norah's decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end the only character i found hollow was sally's eccentric ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era br br a classic that deserves it reputation
<START> no real plot to this one just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes i chuckled once or twice in the beginning much to my chagrin but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake still as bad as this movie is and that's pretty putrid it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer jason friedberg date movie epic movie meet the spartans also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way br br eye candy 11 pair of tits 3 bushes 3 asses br br my grade d br br code red dvd extras original trailer for this film and trailers for beyond the door dead pit the farmer obsessed ones power play sole survivor wacky taxi
<START> the plot it's not so original if someone saw l'ultimo bacio there's nothing new a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that's is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them really boring after an half of hour because it's simple to understand where the story is going to finish this because it's simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal to summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a 30 years old i don't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie
<START> this movie is an awesome non stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy bumbling heroes buffoonish supporting characters made up dolls for heroines nasty villains wisecracks rocking soundtrack choreography and a little dose of action br br amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop heroines are mere rouge smothered props as usual the conmen have no heroines paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward he played a similar don in khoobsurat too asrani shines in a brief role he does a retake on his famous angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer act in sholay br br govinda is impeccable as usual as a wisecracking good humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results amitabh bachchan believe it or not pales in comparison with him but still ab is fine madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song makhna she dances like wind br br viju shah's music is awesome check out kisi disco mein jaayen makhna and the title track br br do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely just enjoy yourself
<START> italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960's and this is certainly one of them the first thing you will notice about danse macabre is the style of the film shot in beautiful black and white and due to director antonio margheriti's use of lighting the film almost looks like it could be a german expressionistic horror film this coupled with the horror filled plot line ensures that danse macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror of course the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters and the good news continues as in this film she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released and so incorporates the great edgar allen poe we follow alan foster a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in the latter's creepy old castle everyone that has spent the night there previously has died and our hero is about to meet the previous wager takers br br nowadays horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre it is refreshing therefore to see this film many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful from the female side of the couple wearing just a see through skirt to my personal favourite a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door this my first antonio margheriti film and even after seeing just this one it's obvious that he was one of italy's premier directors also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co written by another of the italian greats django creator sergio corbucci the plot can meander a little too much at times but there's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring and the fact that it is always intriguing even when the plot slows down ensures the same thing the way that danse macabre utilises the 'haunted house' theme is both well done and original and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible on the whole fans of italian and or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem
<START> i had very low expectations for this alleged re imagining of the original and they weren't even met what were they thinking answer they weren't please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest clip your nails balance your checkbook do anything besides watch this remember if you rent stuff like this it will only ensure they make more
