<START> this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war as if upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in cow dung collehe the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy br br the worst thing is that while dangerous the concept of a policy based on if the ussr and us went to war it could mean the end of the world worked the us and ussr never went to war br br had we only conventional weapons the notion of yet another war a win able war in europe and asia was not unthinkable br br not that i think they should get rid of this movie it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of how not to make a film br br it should be 0 stars or maybe black holes
<START> i didn't even know this was originally a made for tv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washed out colors bland characters and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80's plus a 'social platform' that practically screams afterschool special anyhoo br br rona jaffe's thank you mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons dragons a pen and paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america i count myself one of said geeks tho i have never played d d specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren m m was also made in the heyday of d d's major controversy that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be worshiping satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rare but it dates this movie horrendously br br we meet 4 young college students who play the aptly named mazes and monsters to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life except that m m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the allure of gaming is presented here and jay jay's request to take m m into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere it's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also though at that point we don't really care jay jay robbie kate and daniel are supposed to be different but they're all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really has br br but things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the 'entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns robbie pardu shows why he's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever and the payoff atop the 'two towers' is unintentionally hilarious tom hanks' blubbering jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his career br br don't look at it as a cogent satire just a laughable piece of 80's tv trash and you'll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but it's all worthwhile for pardu's breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here
<START> never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell scott blair who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler bea thorn james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell nan prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy
<START> this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really don't remember any emphasis on judo as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
<START> the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in naturally the film takes place in los angeles orange county he attacks stand up comics caw caw caw rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other mediums eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day it's the best description of post punk anger i've ever seen it's also one of my top 10 favorite films
<START> this reminded me soo much of michael winner's crappy 'dirty weekend' with it's awful english low budget feel br br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say 'demented' for it's ineptitude and 'last house on the left' for it's sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs br br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought 'let's remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel br br the whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point what's with the rapists's daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
<START> after just 15 minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimou's earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin i'm sure my opinion is different from many others as i'm coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and it's certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all 3 the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck there's an air of superiority with this film that's really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase i e an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive w itch she's so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though she's reading her lines from a notecard it's so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest they're tricked into thinking it's brilliant film making ching siu tung's choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if there's subpar obvious wirework then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct b movie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though there's a little pilot inside i know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you don't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu it's obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf i've come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films he's definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
<START> stupid stupid stupid i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today but a movie like this isn't just worth her time she deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie talent is just wasted sorry but i don't feel like writing a review for this br br i give it no stars out of
<START> it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny his skull like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing not only that but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester whatever the cap was made of it looked very new and artificial jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits but brett did not have to dress up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part frewer on the other hand is painful to watch even in the full holmes outfit he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes br br frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad upper crust british accent is painful to see and listen to to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone the jack russell terrier i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone but sadly there is no dog in this movie except for frewer wishbone would have made this movie a lot better br br not only does frewer's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking in that awfully artificial british nasal accent but he is much to friendly and kind frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes wishbone was better at that too that was kindler and gentler whatever the point of frewer's interpretation of sherlock holmes it is flatter than a pancake and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen including the previous worst by charlton heston br br overall the tone of this film is awful it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder all the suspects over acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie even on murder she wrote there is less exposition br br this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes especially the bbc version with jeremy brett this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help br br the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer and when he is often interviewing witnesses his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible unfortunately the rest of the cast is amateurish and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other to show they are suspicious is something that i had not seen in any modern movie
<START> being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design br br now i'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it's good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that's about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far between br br ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on
<START> first of all really kim basinger your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful most likely paid in cash for home and you can't even put on a decent shirt i'm a woman and yes i'm going to come right out say it clean something starting with your hair and while you're at it it's christmas eve buy your kids some presents or at least a christmas tree don't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in and simply buy wrapping paper also the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note don't sign your name i refuse to feel sorry for della obviously due to the fact that kim basinger is this masterpiece's executive producer she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman we get it alec baldwin is a jerk but seriously don't model horrible films after your own life also you're in you 50s you definitely wouldn't have 8 year old twins and those names terry and tammy way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves it's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a girl obviously ms basinger had some say about what goes in the script it's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back apparently della's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat her driving skills are pretty nifty too this film is so clichÃ© it hurts wahhhhh they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you're at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at boohooo the fact that she refuses to take off that bright trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point this woman is a moron who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car but not their purse full of identifying artifacts such as your address i have never wanted the bad guys to succeed as much as when i watched this film and did anyone else happen to catch the african american shirt the black guy was sporting oh yes rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet don't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life instead go do what della couldn't figure out how to do take care of your kids and maybe brush your hair that powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive singing i'll be home for christmas in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets thanks della
<START> although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show ever br br i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and i am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq br br the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics br br basic story that they covered in the episode frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ex girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son he gives money freely to lots of broke students all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him don't worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on i was almost sick at this point br br this 'drama' gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is your gonna laugh at this i sure did br br it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral br br the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br br why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line watching this show is like watching 'last action hero' with arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick except arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br in the words of the simpsons beloved character 'comic book guy' br br worst tv show ever
<START> lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgotten br br he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out br br his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details br br the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected br br at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many by standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dream br br it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train br br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von trier's later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps i'm a realist
<START> this is one of the best movies i've ever seen it has very good acting by hanks newman and everyone else definitely jude law's best performance the cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special to me it takes a lot to beat godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest definitely a best picture nominee in my book
<START> ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself if you remember him he was from the movie dragon the bruce lee story ' jason london is funny as luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula's body from the slab diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend and stephen billington is great as dracula himself giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee's character this is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start it's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note
<START> hello again i have to comment on this wonderful exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue the music in wonderful and memorable very good colorful movie another movie i liked as well later on was high society with bing crosby wonderful music thanks for listening florence forrester stockton reno nevada
<START> this movie is one of the worst ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not annoying i have never watched desparte housewives so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible it's like she knows nothing about acting all her character does is whine throughout the film and she can't pull off being a b and still be entertaining and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them br br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit br br final verdict it's not worth watching
<START> ok let me again admit that i haven't seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated with that admittance let me begin br br before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn't know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movie's hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry moores and her name is sajani and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them word spreads to sajani's husband who questions her involvement with moores she denies any contact with him but moores asks her to leave the area sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions br br sajani's body is discovered right as moores' family comes to visit the alleged perpetrator is moores's english educated assistant t k t k knows of his master's affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is declared innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores t k is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall br br i want to warn you this isn't a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting this image is captured directly from the film's opening but quickly disappears then it's over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love it isn't effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are bundles of walking clichÃ©s moores is an arrogant white man who doesn't recognize his indian friend t k 's intelligence t k is torn between his own heritage and his educative background sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course moores' family is inquisitive into sajani's death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasn't so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isn't the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development br br no this film isn't terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isn't poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here nandita das who plays sajani was part of wonderful indian drama water even director sivan has an impressive resume he recently oversaw the terrorist which is part of roger ebert's great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs apparently the story was timeless and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930's india i don't have any problem with that approach but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan's aura you'll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you aren't in accordance with him and watch something else final consensus and Â½ out of
<START> man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie let''s go over a few plot points oh wait there aren't any there is literally no plot i think casper van dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape this movie is literally the worst movie of all time don't believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to gouge your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous
<START> i've been disappointed if not surprised at the lack of appreciation this film has received once again billy zane proves he's more than just a hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos calling this a silent film is inaccurate as there's a lot of music and sound it has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that ed wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for look at the cast listing and realize that everyone shines no one is there just to show their face i believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of wood and to do a broad physical kind of acting not seen much these days br br but today reviewers try to guess what's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of esthetic appreciation for a movie and iwuetdid has no discernable target audience it was made mostly out of love for wood's script even after his death the trendy social parasites have dealt him another serious blow and deprived the world of a minor classic this is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live at least on dvd
