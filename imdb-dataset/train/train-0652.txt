<START> this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced written and directed vanity project while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me before the burning at the stake sequence this is the worst piece of sh t i've ever worked on and i've worked on a lot of pieces of sh t also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario a religious shrine in chimayÃ³ at which point one of the local vato loco low rider onlookers growled show some respect man which apparently caused jim to remember where he was as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories like the night we caught the producer director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in like they say ya gotta' love the biz
<START> i have to say this is one of the worst films i've ever seen they had a pretty good storyline to go on but than the messed it up so badly first of all the cast is all wrong where did that van peeble crap actor btw and puff daddy come from it looks like carlito has come from the hood and used to hang about with some real idiots this film doesn't do carlitos way any justice im so happy that the sequel carlito's way came out first if i had seen this rubbish first i would have never given the pacino version a chance and anyway pacino is supposed to have read this story thought it's crap and did the sequel instead carlito's way rise to power 1 out of 10 carlito's way 9 out of 10
<START> nick cage is randall raines a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother kip giovanni ribisi when he screws up on a job by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night he has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch but the cops are onto him so can he pull it off this was one of the great candidates of a film to re make as the original was far from a classic and if you don't go into it expecting much and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is you'll end up enjoying the ride watch it on a double bill with the fast and the furious for a night of high speed hijinks just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards br br my grade b br br dvd extras 7 minute jerry bruckheimer interview bruckheimer bio filmography action overload highlight reel the big chase 0 to 60 featurette wild rides featurette stars on the move the cult painted on the heart music video theatrical trailer and trailers for shanghai noon mission to mars and coyote ugly
<START> the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on br br this film is asinine it's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting i didn't care about any of the characters but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i'd complain about the money i spent but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining live free or die hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of captivity for 40 minutes
<START> this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made for television drama my all time favourite actor robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole california setting the cars are really great as well as i recall i give this film a 10 and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute remember just because it's made for television doesn't mean it isn't great art
<START> except for the acting of meryl streep which is of note as always i'd avoid this film because it has a dated movie of the week quality about it but it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind how a couple endures media scrutiny and how the different are treated br br throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different australians are different than us most of the rest of the world so we most of us automatically come at it with an air of oddness about them the couple involved is religious different than most of culture and adventists different at that so their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with dingos are different animals than other dogs so again we're faced with oddness questions the real story then is how society and the world treats the different those who have different accents different beliefs than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect br br it's difficult to hear the phrase a dingo took my baby without laughing and there are humorous posts sadly all over the web about it but in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered as you'll find in web searches that much larger children have been stalked by dingos research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos maybe a pair extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace br br yet what is left behind is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children why because a woman's affect expression is so cold she is assumed to be guilty and on and on br br haunting questions with or without the film
<START> a very engaging intelligent and well made film liam neeson and tim roth play their roles superbly the cinematography is outstanding the fight scenes are amazing this is a film i will enjoy watching again and again one of my favorites
<START> despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyone br br the story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and wins br br in girlfight it's boxing in bend it like beckham it's soccer and now it's kung fu br br but fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it semra turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she can't do is to act her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this clichÃ© movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer br br even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this it's just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet br br the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's european it's very easy to publicize this movie a first martial arts film from denmark but don't be fooled it's not it's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincing br br bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story
<START> for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone's comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing
<START> first i'd like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the movies less so with episode 2 though captured something magical it's hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie it's an idea br br how may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly it's darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin not just luke but even before 1 3 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far away br br star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope
<START> as a true elvis fan this movie is a total embarrasment and the script is a disaster the movie opens with the beautiful son stay away and the scenery of the grand canyon gives the viewer hope of something special elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time especially on the rest of the featured songs i sat through this movie twice just to make sure it is a piece of junk 1 out of 10
<START> why bother seeing this movie if you have great movies to see it is a total waste of time and money the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it everything in it is bad actors were bad script was really bad the story is stupid and the worst cgi ever the only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club one interesting thing that there is a characther that we wish that he dies because he is so stupid that we get enough of him i don't remember the name but was the boyfriend of the chosen one br br note if you want to see a good movie this movie isn't the right choice 0 stars out of 10
<START> tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy after his great fist movie called el fondo del mar and the spectacular tv pro gramme los simuladores damian szifron made another great work tiempo de valientes looks for moments a movie made in hollywood diego peretti and luis luque are two great actors and here they have great performances the movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you wanna have a great time and i have to congrats szifron for all the talent he has br br rating 9
<START> you've gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolie's and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them it's because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesn't fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking 1 2
<START> this beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving it shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world with a sense of family that we have lost the story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic it has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western movies br br the acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people this is brilliant directing and movie making br br would love to see more movies by this director
<START> finally timon and pumbaa in their own film br br 'the lion king 1 1 2 hakuna matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale which classic tale you ask why 'the lion king' of course br br yep if there's one thing that disney is never short of it's narcissism br br but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film it's basically the events of 'the lion king' as told from timon and pumbaa's perspective and it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'the lion king' by heart to see where they're coming from br br anyway at one level i was watching this and thinking oh my god this is so lame and on another level i was having a ball much of the humour is predictable i mean when pumbaa makes up two beds a big one for himself and a small one for timon within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious which imo is 'hakuna matata' in a nutshell it's not what happens it's how br br and a note of warning there are also some fart jokes seriously did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage but as fart jokes go these are especially good and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur br br the returning voice talent is great i'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return what with most of them only having two or three lines if they're lucky whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome br br the music is also great from 'digga tunnah' at the start to 'that's all i need' an adaption of 'warthog rhapsody' a song that was cut from 'the lion king' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever br br in the end timon and pumbaa are awesome characters and while it may be argued that 'hakuna matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with br br am i starting to sound creepy br br either way 'the lion king 1 1 2' is great if you've seen 'the lion king' far too many times especially if you are right now thinking don't be silly there's no such thing as seeing 'the lion king' too many times
<START> first an explanation despite my headline i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made all the criticisms registered here have valid points also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue especially dry jewish love suffused sarcasm and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie br br so much for warnings here's my main point walter matthau is flat out perfect even beyond perfect in this movie i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star self image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch and he only barely shows us that sad part it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now i mention this as a warning but artistically it's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots i'm seen in possibly any film performance this is beyond method acting matthau's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery this is a masterpiece of comic acting br br about richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception although he has some fine moments here chicken is funny is one of them so if you like him you should like him here and if you don't this movie won't change your mind br br about the 1976 oscars i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in cuckoo's nest that year it was a killer year for leading actor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys not to dis jack's fine work as mcmurphy but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance i mean he was good in this movie but not that good burns's fine as ever but unexceptional in itself return to show biz beat brad dourif's truly brilliant debut in cuckoo's nest not to mention chris sarandon's stunning debut in dog day afternoon which i think proves my theory br br oscar theories aside here's my bottom line review if you like matthau's comic acting then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother inspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides but if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now
<START> it is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it br br at first i must tell you that i love animated movies unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws br br 1 i quoted the tag line it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before br br 2 the flies in this movie look nothing like real flies at least they could've make them black but cyan flies seriously with giant heads and slim torsos br br 3 the story i guess it was written for 6 year old kids i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified br br 4 excessive patriotism for example they are american files after all oh give me a break
<START> which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement overall dinocroc was a much better movie sure in that movie matt borlenghi played a complete wuss bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the dinocroc but the special effects in dinocroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better here are the problems with blood surf 1 the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw 2 the plot is ridiculous matt borlenghi co get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film and 3 there's not enough croc time there are a couple of redeeming qualities of blood surf the actresses are pretty attractive and matt borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie but if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one matt borlenghi killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up dinocroc instead
<START> this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched i couldn't sit through the whole thing i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping i mean what was that all about i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have ingwasted a Â£4 rental fee the quality both picture and sound are terrible the acting well doesn't exist it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup urghh avoid at all cost the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears br br this was like possibly worse than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car br br definatey not one to buy folks sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have
