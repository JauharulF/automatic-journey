<START> emma was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid nineties and it was recently shown on british television doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with pride and prejudice two years ago we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic becoming jane and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels these include northanger abbey the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete no doubt however there will be more to come in the near future there is after all her juvenile love and freindship sic the short novella lady susan and someone somewhere has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments the watsons and sanditon then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writersÂÂÂ br br the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england not as some reviewers have assumed victorian england austen died before queen victoria was even born emma is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications br br emma always insists that she will not marry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome mr knightley we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage it does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy knightley who is sixteen years older than emma she is 21 he 37 and related to her by marriage is more like a father figure than a lover much more of a father figure in fact than her actual father a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenth century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well but this is not really one of the great screen romances br br of the other characters i liked juliet stephenson's vulgar mrs elton and toni collette's harriet i know that in the novel harriet was a naÃ¯ve young teenager whereas here she is more like the character collette played in muriel's wedding a gauche slightly overweight twentysomething fretting about her chances of finding a man nevertheless i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen's themes br br emma is one of austen's more light hearted works without the darker overtones of mansfield park or even pride and prejudice and this is reflected on screen we see a world of beauty and grace full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners apart from the ruffianly gypsies who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are mrs bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of picturesque rose strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over Â£500 000 we can be sure that their poverty is relative not absolute in emma's world poverty is defined as not having your own stately home this is of course not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth century life but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen sink realist sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for analysing human character was more in her line br br i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 sense and sensibility or the recent pride and prejudice it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending but it is in the main a highly enjoyable austen adaptation 7 10
<START> i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks which i thought was pretty good i was right in all honesty i thought it could have been better sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me the acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much better this movie i'd say is for teens and the young of heart full of female bodies alcohol and sex it's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again 4 10 is my vote for this one
<START> can only be described as awful it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse but fear not because it does another poorly written script for a donkey director for no talent offspring of past movie stars it's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both as for the hero well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete doesn't even blink then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies this is a really ridiculous movie lucky it only cost me 1 to hire
<START> in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi however due to the earlier import of george romero's dawn of the dead which had gone by that name for its italian release it was retitled to zombi 2 which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie continuing this theme the second zombi film which would have been called zombi 2 was then consequently titled zombi 3 in the uk the original zombi film that is zombi 2 was titled zombie flesh eaters to continue this theme the second zombi film zombi 3 was then titled zombie flesh eaters 2 for its uk release are you following all this so if zombie flesh eaters was fulci's dawn then is 2 his day of the dead while this is only a flippant observation this tale of military compounds helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance br br some of fulci's european direction compels in a film like this but the acting dubbing and exposition heavy script are absolutely horrendous its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext while there's an unintentionally hilarious birds homage combining this last element with mor 80s rock is not a good idea for some reason i couldn't stop thinking of time of the apes q v the whole time i was watching this this is obviously not a good thing br br while there's nothing here to rival topless scuba diving shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter fulci's misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner's mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing both themes are combined when a woman's face is ripped off first by one zombie then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman's stomach br br production wise this is obviously a step up from zombi coming five years later nine years in worldwide release terms but without the original's low key charm it struggles while stefano mainetti's music is inappropriate and uninspired fabio frizzi's score was one of the best things about the '79 movie here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tyler's holding out for a hero in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest and roger and kenny two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious we're out of ammunition to a stalling gun is a particular standout but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves low key or not fulci's original had truly magnificent rotting zombies skull faces worms in eye sockets they really were something to behold by contrast this dull follow up opts for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option br br the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal br br it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes the rest filmed by bruno mattei i'm fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave unfortunately however it's his name that's above the film title on releases so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through on that scale then it's a major setback for him for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring
<START> in the year 2006 in cold blood a riveting thriller from 1967 has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have first and most chillingly is the fact that it's star robert blake was recently on trial for murdering his wife second the recent oscar winning biopic capote showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author truman capote these two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience br br as a stand alone film from it's era in cold blood is top notch in every way most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from conrad hall later of american beauty and road to perdition fame many of the stills from this film of the kansas farm house at night or the tree lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography combined with the cracker jack direction from brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events it's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen br br the film is also anchored nicely by robert blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo the flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last confession so to speak it's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting superb writing flawless direction and haunting photography i dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down robert blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears br br the only thing hampering in cold blood is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end the tacked on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey
<START> i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences by the finale there are too many unanswered questions what's worse as the story is so confusing it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie now that would really be fun
<START> give this movie a break its worth at least a 7 that little girl is a good actor and she's cute too jim belushi is a comic genius you can't help but feel good at the end i wish there were more wholesome shows like this that you can enjoy with your kids
<START> at the beginning of the movie the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing however the story was so very slow and boring and then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox which leads to tragic events we live in the forest and frequently see foxes one thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar this movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it in trying to make a wild creature into a pet i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be even after the terrible events with the main fox the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits does she never learn her lesson and there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie what a disappointment this movie was and what a horrible story it tells the final narrated dialog was so stupid by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv i absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone
<START> it's a lovely movie it deeply reflects the chinese underground bands' current lives if you chinese culture traditionaled rock n roll music there you go i will highly recommend this one but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in mainland i sorta doubt it d
<START> i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards br br much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama arising from the 'high concept' science fiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey's aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom it's not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of it br br everytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal 'life' yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedged bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are br br concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say it's not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly 30 years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in 2036 a technocratic socialist we don't believe in independent nation states type government in britain after 1970 hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheaded luddite fascist as under the boss or all hands to the pump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters br br much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isn't explored but then this was the 1930s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightly br br i would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous br br yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate br br things to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis 'tis much as silly in wells' words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it
<START> prison is set in wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years warden eaton sharpe lane smith is put in charge 200 odd prisoners are shipped in they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including burke viggo mortensen who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out all the electrics gas fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing no one is safe br br directed by renny harlin i thought prison was a poor late 80's horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story the script was by empire pictures regular c courtney joyner who was responsible for writing such 'classics' as class of 1999 1990 puppet master iii toulon's revenge 1991 puppet master vs demonic toys 2004 amongst other low budget horror crap that even i haven't heard of seems to take itself very seriously the biggest problems i have with prison are that it's far too slow it's over 30 minutes into the film before the 'evil force' is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned then there's the fact there's no discernible storyline here at all for a start it never tries to explain why there's an 'evil force' bricked up in the old execution chamber it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it's supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn't kill warden sharpe straight away no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted has come back there's no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything that's going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it's never revealed what it is or why to be honest i couldn't really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn't have a rigid story which it follows all the way through the character's are dull forgettable the murders are few far between the pacing is way off the whole film is a mess even ghosts can't shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero a less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes there really are better things you could be doing br br director harlin's full american flick debut he does a good job there's a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab dull dark prison cells corridors i started to get bored i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive bland frankly lifeless i didn't think it was scary the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open other than that there's a burnt corpse a mangled body which falls from the ceiling very little else there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard i was watching this scene thought that you'd never get away with doing something like that over here prisoners have rights if the warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians every prisoner would sue the warden the prison service the government for everything they had they'd win br br with a supposed budget of about 4 000 000 prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn't really look like it on screen sure there's a decent cast the few special effects that are included are good but overall it's set in the same location with limited ambition prison was actually shot in a real wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business the acting is alright prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of mortensen he has two with this the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre 1994 both of which i'm sure he'd like to forget about br br prison is a dull lifeless colourless humourless waste of 100 minutes despite one good gore scene i didn't like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense
<START> i watched this film along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on including seeing plays in preparation for some academic research the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr rochester all of his most fundamental traits are gone where is his wit where is his passion scott's rochester more closely resembles rochester's foil st john than the character from the novel in fact the actor playing st john in this adaptation played a passionate st john while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time i have no idea what they were thinking i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly can't bear to see this film for too long because of george c scott's performance
<START> the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed up things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on screen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out right other than that this is very good quality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there it's worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him br br sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book
<START> a young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked to speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day once there he sees visions of a woman in black is she real or imaginary he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill that spends it first third building up its characters before moving to the creepy country house its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately this really should have been in black white but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little underwhelmed
<START> the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot filled with gas don't spill it man hilarious stuff and then as 'the plot' ensues you're in for one heck of a ride i watched this film recently and it holds up being just as funny upon each viewing check it out
<START> disney what happened i really wish the movie had been set in the 60's like the book was and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption i'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books but the man with red eyes interchangeable as it and what's up with the volcanic upheaval where was that in the book peter jackson save us a long time ago 1978 i heard that there was european version of this film i sure wish i could id it i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption this movie needs to be x'd
<START> though not a fan of sam rockwell i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'joshua ' heck i wasn't even aware he was in 'joshua' until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of 'rosemary's baby ' 'the omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'joshua' was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a low low budget movie or at least that's how they designed it a person falls Â you don't see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab Â you don't see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up i'm not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid Â joshua who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days she's alive Â and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i don't think so they were nuts prior and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut i'm sure that might have been the idea but for pete's sake give me something anything there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore joshua's more like the mini me of the antichrist
<START> this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tv looking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age and the examination day a point where 12 year olds must undergo a government required iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry it's pretty obvious they are worried i won't give anything away in the ending but i will say this there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night by today's standards we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching but why would his family ask this the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i haven't read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a 16 year ld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesn't go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college he's been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700 the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably 3 4 of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew
<START> bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van halen bring out a 3rd film
<START> this was one of the worst films i have ever seen br br i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film br br most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it er ok br br also trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work alas it does here as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous in an enclosed space with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea br br anyway about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation however if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate br br it pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made br br oh did i mention the last five minutes well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques absolutely priceless
