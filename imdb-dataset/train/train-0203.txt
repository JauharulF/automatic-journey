<START> modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was 1948 communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly
<START> the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its best worst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichÃ©s on every level story line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses br br
<START> it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years for me the main problem's the uneven script br br while some of it is witty and hip quite a bit of it is dull unfunny and lifeless many of the gags just sit there lacking spark and energy br br of the cast mae west and rachel welch come over well roger herren in the role of rusty shines too bad he didn't make more films but for my money there's just too much of john huston and poor rex reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines wondering what he's doing in this film br br the low user rating should give an idea as to the public's opinion of this piece vidal's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted not even the 'classic' film clips did much all in all a rather sub par effort and it's not likely to get much better with time
<START> the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always reliably returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isn't the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity but it's still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make up effects Â although courtesy of a young stan winston Â are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the film's title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat cave and a bat mobile a stolen ambulance the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon weekend exploring caves they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal's vicious attack worried that he might be infected with rabies he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesn't prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat guano so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolf theme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy there's a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring film's current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldn't feel and traditional without the bat people
<START> this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while it is so awful that i am not sure where to begin or even if it is worth it the plot is the real problem and i feel sorry for 'sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part but that plot oh dear oh dear i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top whilst the helicopter is on the way a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes i could go on but it isn't worth it apart from the grim opening which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of the rest is drivel sorry folks but this is about as bad as film making gets
<START> simply not the quality i expected from morris love brass eye and blue jam this is very much like a not so bad student film what concerns me in all this is why did it win a bafta morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity' ayn rand in much of his work nathan barley and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining br br i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle the humanity of terrorism four lions that he isn't going to cock that up wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena
<START> whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i've ever seen this movie is always on it it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing and i would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again br br what's wrong with it let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater br br i went to a midnight show on a saturday night i the only ones in the theater were myself and a bunch of loud boisterous rather unruly teenagers sitting somewhere behind me they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night and had come to this comedy for some laughs before the movie starts during the previews they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time it was borderline annoying had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie i might've said something but i was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun so i let it go and they did settle down once the movie started br br why am i telling you all this because you can judge this alleged comedy by the effect it had not just on myself but on this rowdy bunch br br during the entire run of the film not one person in the theater laughed not once not myself not the boisterous kids absolute silence aside from the soundtrack and when the film was over and the lights came on we all all of us slowly filed out of the theater in slow somber absolute silence it could've been a funeral br br this was the effect that this comedy produced not laughter not enjoyment but absolute depression it was a depressing depressing movie and not the tiniest bit funny preachy self indulgent depressing but not funny br br i consider mel brooks' blazing saddles to be on the short list for funniest movie ever it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever br br in short if you're feeling too happy give this movie a whirl otherwise don't say i didn't warn you

<START> grand canyon is a very strange bird it's a completely unique urban piece where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much br br it's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race background and station but to proclaim that the theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope similarly to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile br br the film has volumes to say though likely different volumes for every viewer and says it all in such a non preachy way from so many angles that in the end i can't even define its central message for myself br br nevertheless it does it's business with such laser precision every prop line of dialog and bar of background music contributing to it's pervasive mood and powerful message that i'm pleasantly surprised and come away very thoughtful after every viewing still it doesn't feel at all stuffy a sparkling film with a great cast and everything working
<START> 089 footlight parade 1933 released 9 30 1933 viewed 5 5 07 br br the ice cream cone is invented in new york br br kevin after a long and busy break we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros this time it's the ultra fast paced footlight parade starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent i am 100 certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute joan blondell is also excellent as the acid tongued secretary turned love interest the ruby keeler dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable one thing that baffled me was berkeley's performances themselves which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards obviously busby doesn't let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over the top musical numbers he can possibly conjure i liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number shanghai lil which as one can guess is about as stomach turning as racially distasteful performances come br br doug six movies in three months got to be a new record anywayÂthis completes warner bros ' musical trilogy of 1933 preceded by '42nd street' and 'gold diggers of 1933 ' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by busby i hope it was it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does the funny thing about cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense he was 5'7 square headed and talked with an odd new york accent but the guy was quite versatile going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast talking producer types we see here and he could dance basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor the rest of the cast has some familiar faces joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney's loyal and lusting secretary dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp the movie is typical of the more racy and adult oriented musicals of the pre code era as opposed to those of the 50's and 60's that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year the shanghai lil number not withstanding with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese br br last film dinner at eight 1933 next film i'm no angel 1933
<START> while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind this is still a stunning film that presages the science fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen it predicts the global chaos of wwii but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release and which still impress today this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre
<START> i saw this little belgian gem two days after seeing 'american teen' make no mistake about it adolescence is a roller coaster ride be it american or european 'naissance des pieuvres' or as it is being called in the u s 'water lillies' is a tale of a young 15 year old girl played by pauline acquart who at times resembles a young scarlett johansson acts the cool withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team just to be close to another attractive girl adele haenel it's more than obvious that marie is more than attracted to floriane figuring among all of this is marie's rather plump unattractive friend anne who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age along the way we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes broken hearts shop lifting alcohol and or drug use casual sex etc this is a quiet little film that takes time to work it's way into your system michael bay fans take note the pacing here is s l o w so steer clear but if you have no problem with this water lillies is a charmer no rating here but would pull down a hard r due to language nudity adult situations
<START> before tuscan sky i saw diane lane's tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost which makes it so realistic maybe you had to be a camper to really get it but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet this is so camp from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell it's amp once exciting activities now seem mundane a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one two dimensional roles and makes them believable bill paxton diane elizabeth mrs brad paisley probably when he first fell for her the beautiful scenery bright colors comical music including variations of hello muddah and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend
<START> if you've read the original novel as i did you will probably hate this thing br br the film version of absolute beginners is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a period piece set in the late 1950s and failing to re create or even pay homage to that period the us monstrosity of dirty dancing does similar to 1963 except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing in addition to suffering from looking too 1980s the characters have been changed re arranged and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and of course their names suze is transformed from the narrator's flighty ex girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money at her own admittance in the first few pages into a hapless and naive eve archetype seduced by fame and glamour exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss who surprisingly wasn't given a van dyke and pointy hairstyle she and the narrator re named colin after the book's author colin macinnes for the film are also in a relationship br br big jill's character a lesbian seemingly butch yet fop like in her mid 20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble headed lesbians and one of the narrator's closest friends dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator is reduced to a sort of named extra with only a few throw away lines and tonnes of comical outfits br br the fabulous hoplite a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film camped up and all but ignored br br the narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator's mum seems for all practical purposes ignored br br in its favour the music for what it is is well composed and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book some days they'll write musicals about the 1950s as their inspiration to write a musical but in the world of bad camped up musicals this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch unlike shock treatment or starstruck crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts unlike the apple there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue br br you really can't blame it's too 1980s feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s the film version of annie released in 1981 pays a wonderfully well executed tribute to the look and feel of new york city in the 1930s and napolean dynamite manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 though it's not explicitly set in the 1980s those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film feels very 1980s obviously it was possible to make something good out of this especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the uk but it fails most apparently in the look and feel and also in its treatment of the source material which is downright disrespectful br br perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late 1950s soho london's modernist jazz set i can definitely see what the writing team were attempting but they definitely could have done better with boy george as a household name and mixed race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 uk they definitely did not need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing in fact i'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen aged audience like two bit idiots to make a quick buck off of
<START> wow my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted i will try to tone this one down lets be real no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main character there was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie stank i have to wonder if old chuck just can't hang with the best any more has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie chuck is an awesome martial artist and as we have seen from walker texas ranger a fairly good actor but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies and this one does not very disappointing for us norris fans chuck stay as the main character in your movies because this does not work for you gary
<START> i grew up watching and loving tng i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand riker's character which is how it probably would have been treated on voy they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as clichÃ© in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on bar none worst episode ever
<START> no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full time photographer it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws for one thing angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scenes the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original but overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching
<START> if you're the kind of movie goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense then look elsewhere kids cause sleepwalkers really sucks usually i'm more eloquent than that but wow this was bad i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home she declines and then he is seen walking home where's his car anyway just don't see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn cheesey lines up the proverbial wazoo just don't see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen king's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard he's actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman king gives the best performance of the film but other than that wow bad
<START> i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible because i have seen worse but it's not even halfway decent br br the plot is very confusing i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going when the movie was over i was left scratching my head i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br character development is very shallow i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it's credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which should make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters this film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible br br another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them so i never really missed any of them br br and last but not least was sadie's singing it's awful the music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl a thon br br as a whole this movie is confusing characters are ill developed georgia's acting is wooden and stiff sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation the music was unbearable and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain
<START> this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheap br br overall the film looked low budget and silly it's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and or has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat chunky hedy lamarr it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america she looks like 2 completely different people br br it's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it
