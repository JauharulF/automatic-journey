<START> this hong kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week's worth of 'the young the restless' this one is more of a throwback to the original 'emmanuelle' trilogy especially 'goodbye emmanuelle' than a d'amato sleazefest chai lee emy wong undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot to trot streetwalker future italian porn star politician illona staller who would later go by the name ciccolina and have sex with an hiv positive john holmes plays emy's competition exotic locales and some decent soft core scenes round this one out recommended for fans of the original 'emmanuelle' of which i am one
<START> this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening scene br br don't be fooled by the title end of the world is truly a bad movie i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit
<START> there is no such a thing as perfect murder lieutenant columbo knows that ken franklin who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories doesn't know that he kills his partner jim ferris who had plans on going solo now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr franklin and returns for one more question columbo murder by the book 1971 is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame steven bochco wrote it columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look it's hard to believe this man could solve any crime but he could each and every one of them peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character so no remakes please this part is a very good example of how columbo worked jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim rosemary forsyth plays the victim's wife joanna ferris there's something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her how he makes the omelet and everything barbara colby plays lilly la sanka she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here i've been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them there was a break for many years that they weren't showing columbo stories at all but now he's back back for one more question
<START> as an impressionable 10 year old i liked the love conquers all philosophy of the 70s sitcom bridget loves bernie i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david birney and an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter and both sets of parents harold j stone and bibi osterwald as bernie's parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget's parents who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage br br looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highly rated season created by veteran tv writer bernard slade who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight br br there was no denying the real life chemistry between birney and baxter but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects birney in his short lived role in st elsewhere and baxter in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject br br the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles br br this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered
<START> they were always trying to get me killed alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white suit's technicians they thought actors got in the way of things he went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and assured it was safe narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid descent br br people get in the way of things might be a maxim tailor made for white suit inventor sidney stratton fittingly played blank slate fashion by alec guinness in alexander mackendrick's definitive ealing film of 1951 certainly he cares only about his work its realisation and sod the consequences and similarly with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour br br told in flashback the film concerns stratton's invention of a dirt resistant everlasting fibre fashioned into the white suit of the title and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it br br while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job abduction and bribery attempts follow with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer daphne the delectable 4 packs a day voiced joan greenwood to the tragi comic end br br what's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do bemoans stratton's landlady near the close a notion stratton hadn't even considered and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda br br a superior if decidedly downbeat comedy expertly performed and pretty much answering the oft raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water
<START> this is a great short i think every voice is done by jason steele you can only just barely tell if you've heard his normal voice though so don't worry about them sounding the same they don't its about 15 minutes long br br edward the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he meets some weird people in fact everyone he knows seem pretty crazy br br edward general peterson we have to get you to a medical unit no i'm not gonna make it edward dont talk like that i'm sure you'll be fine im a goner edward and you know it before i go yes can i just have one kiss umm no come on just one small peck on the lips im walking away now sir br br there's gonna be movie pretty soon the date for that is in september but its probably gonna get pushed back
<START> it's not well shot well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show i've seen since twin peaks every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure they have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they've just told you everything you wanted to know however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal some characters are very two dimensional the more experienced actors like locke and ecko really stand out over actors who play jack kate sayid and so on the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing however the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously all in all its a great show but not perfect
<START> this film is hilarious original beautifully directed i have become a big bad swim groupie tracking it to film festivals whenever wherever i can i've seen it about half a dozen times now each time enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years at nearly every festival it has screened it has either sold out or won the audience favorite award it's clear that people love this film even clearer why they do the cinematography is superb the characterization acting brilliant the ending fantastic the direction filled with compassion wisdom the art of perfect timing it's hard to believe this is ishai setton's first film i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it
<START> clint eastwood would star again as the battle weary detective harry callahan but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry' series 'sudden impact' again like the other additions brings its own distinguishable style and tone but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments and bestowing a classic line go ahead make my day Â but some of its humor has to been seen to believe a bulldogÂ named meathead that pisses and farts oh yeah however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco br br the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood he's ordered to take leave but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo where a murder has occurred similar in vein bullet to groin and between eyes to his case there he begins to dig up dirt which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge br br to be honest i wasn't all that crash hot on eastwood's take but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'magnum force' this well assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging it's like he's experimenting with noir thriller touches with character driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework his use of images is lasting due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics dark tones brooding lightingÂ like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure harry with his new 44 automag handgun moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks it's a striking sight that builds fear mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor it seemed to come off a major plus with these films are the dialogues while i wouldn't call 'sudden impact' first rate it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable linesÂ you're a legend in your own mind don't you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip before pulling out his piece the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intenseÂ the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages lalo schfrin would return as composer after 'the enforcer had jerry fielding scoring bringing a methodical funky kick which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get go bruce surtees an eastwood regular gets the job behind the camera where he did a piecing job with 'dirty harry' and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments br br eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry's quest for justiceÂ by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it i just found it oddÂ a real change of heart across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke her turn of traumatic torment being senselessly raped along with her younger sister is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity when the anger is released it's tactically accurate in its outcome paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big mouthed performance these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell a regular in the series 1 4 but under different characters how can you forget him in 'dirty harry'Â yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote do i feel lucky well do ya punk
<START> i liked it i really did please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film i expected it to be crap it was crap but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it i didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales and there wasn't any but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment and it did entertain me throughout films like this are why the ben stillers excusing 'there's something about mary' and the vince vaughns however you spell his last name i couldn't be bothered checking have jobs it's ok to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it and i for one shall take a stand jog perhaps run but not drive because i don't have a car to blockbuster video or even choices and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them good day to you reader p s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don't like you if you do say it helped then god bless you you will go to heaven
<START> i'd even say some shades of hitchcock this is clearly better than mmm which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans by the way did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery anyhow woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one the plot turns are nice and tight i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines but stick around scarlett johansson proves well cast in the diane keaton type role and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman
<START> i am from the dallas fort worth area and lived in arlington for a few years this movie was way off as far as making it look like arlington i saw mountains in the background of one scene texas doesn't have mountains i guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in texas is filmed in canada the accents are also really bad they should have gotten actors from texas to play the parts there a lot of aspiring actors from texas out in hollywood the movie is really sad though because it is a true story i pray that the killer is found and convicted the one good thing is that bc of her death we now have the amber alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted
<START> where to begin anachronism high tech cross bow with a scope in about 500ad arrows with explosive charges in 500ad a monster grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him the heart torn out of his victim's chest without any sense of contact possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make up and streaked hair the ancient danish court represented in classical greek style the queen played by marina sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness the effects are way too weak to carry this story there are some stories that don't mind or even benefit from cheap effects but this grendel isn't one of them br br what about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation a bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the geats to help the desperate danes in this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth br br beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure i suspect that any modern telling which doesn't make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail i didn't love the recent beowulf and grendel which sees grendel essentially as human and sees hrothgar and his danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize grendel's attacks as well justified vengeance but i had to respect its revisionist position that hrothgar's danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped even after it was all over that they had brought this nightmare on themselves and therefore the original story of beowulf as it was written was a misrepresentation of the real story i think there's a more complex meaning to be understood than that but this grendel's terrible secret that grendel's attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice doesn't really bring us closer to the shame experienced by hrothgar and the danes br br this beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy i give it a 4 higher than it deserves but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently in the meantime sci fi's movie making seems to be following the nasa policy that it's better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed
<START> the cover of box of this movie has kyle minogue's name on it but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in scream that's the first thing that makes this movie lame they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for 5 minutes br br of course we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around to top it all off molly ringwald of 80's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film it's a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states br br either way this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that's in it throughout the movie we're supposed to guess who's the killer long story short remember our little friend molly she saves the day or does she br br this move is just plain bad rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf don't spread the horror
<START> i picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was but when i watched it i laughed so hard it is now one of my favorite movies of all time rusty and the guys created a masterpiece i would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor thank you rusty for giving us something to laugh at
<START> i know i'm in the minority but br br uwe boll is about as talented as a frog not even a toad just a frog he's reminiscent of about a hundred other no talent hacks who churn out one useless crap fest after another br br this movie is a crap fest slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things like his failed relationship on his mind reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons or has one of the worst directors in the history of film i'm voting on the third choice myself although the other two are always possible br br uwe boll has never done a single thing from which i've derived even the slightest pleasure frankly i'm satisfied that he made this stinker i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with underworld evolution for ticket sales now i'm confident that len wiseman has nothing and i mean nothing to worry about br br this rates a 1 0 10 rating for this messy convoluted crap fest from br br the fiend
<START> medellin is a fabulous place to live work and study i've been there twice and never did i hear anything about guerrilla activities paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or anything of the sort there are invisible police but it is not a big brother system there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not hassle someone without good reasons br br la sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters the directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la sierra and when a character dies there is genuine pathos it is difficult to imagine however that the three youths are all members of the bloque metro a gang that used to terrorize la sierra before the colombian government began to restructure the country br br la sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in colombia there are of course things to be wary of such as petty crime but when one considers pickpocketing happens in modern cities such as london new york or tokyo colombia doesn't seem that different after all colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war torn country is now prospering more than ever
<START> i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on this has to be the worst piece of monkey s t i have ever seen i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but i got bored and turned it off let's see br br the wardrobe consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot the masks were made from what looks like tin foil br br the gore the gore was pretty good i must give it that but ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget movie br br acting was horrible i didn't mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in ittenbach's premutos great movie the fighting and action sequences were pi poor br br bottom line don't watch any of schnaas's movies there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter check premutos house of blood schramm and the nekromantiks
<START> first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies nothing and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i say more power to you i on the other hand just want to be entertained which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time seems that most here agree also most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and well i guess you see where this is going avoid this one sucks bad
<START> the cat o'nine tails il gatto a nove code br br aspect ratio 2 35 1 cromoscope br br sound format mono br br 35mm and 70mm release prints br br a blind ex journalist karl malden overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter james franciscus to investigate a series of murders at the lab unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer br br rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage 1969 dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tails as a giallo thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden fresh from his appearance in patton 1969 and rising star franciscus the valley of gwangi sadly the resulting film which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than bird is a disappointing follow up impeccably photographed and stylishly executed but too plodding and aimless for general consumption br br malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles and cinematographer enrico menczer the dead are alive uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi tech world in which argento's dark hearted scenario unfolds but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak the libertine as franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black gloved assassin in a crowded railway station edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations but despite these flashes of brilliance the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil it's no surprise that cat failed to emulate the runaway success of bird when released in 1971 br br english version
