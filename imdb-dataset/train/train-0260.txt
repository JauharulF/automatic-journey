<START> i just did not enjoy this film but then i loved babe a pig in the city and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way the animals were not likeable they were all irritating especially chris rock's guinea pig but then what could i expect it's chris rock i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it
<START> in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened br br one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co stars and does a semi decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can re create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future
<START> i felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else whether intentionally or not we are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective advanced nations i write from japan where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon pubs in england were once all male the business world was totally off limits for women in america until rather recently and women in china had their feet bound so they couldn't develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another back to the issue of sexuality we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game the official reason is that the men are bad especially such boyish girls a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well i think one point is that not all women are the same and the women the police are trying to protect are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in and each one separately at all it is a brutish man's world any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed the world of sexuality is not one size fits all br br meanwhile the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who knows where and in a much more subtle way begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them these had definite ideas about women and femininity which were being challenged head on the change in attitude is glacial but visible br br since the movie is pure iran from the first moment it takes a little easing into for the foreigner but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you and you end up getting the whole picture and even understanding the men's misunderstandings and give them slack the supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the ayatollahs which remain unseen and unnamed and likely unremembered br br knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved
<START> my kasi lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman this film is a lost gem a dead on satire mockumentary of the early 90's hip hop scene when mc hammer had just began to fade away into that good night we follow the three members of the nwh as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would be riches and fame and like nickolas nickleby at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started but at least a little wiser and lot less naive this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of but it's the kind of film you either love or hate a lot like company man in this regard i regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate new york it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself
<START> just utter trash i'm a huge fan of the cusacks this being the sole reason i watched this movie but the only reason i can see for their presence was the reprise in complete and depth less quality their exact roles from grosse point blanc apart from that the films' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose and to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery but seeing as though this is nothing near grosse point blanc and in the same league as meet the watch if your a moron spartans in terms of political satire lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves
<START> although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman br br i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters br br the story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the story br br i highly recommend this movie and i must confess i'll forever look at my mom in a different light
<START> writer director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film br br unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the 30 minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footage br br finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked up version of it he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his smoking gun sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth br br as with most films of this type sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence
<START> this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellent br br the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here it's liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs well br br few actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this
<START> i saw the film at the nashville film festival it was beautifully done from cinematography to the acting it's the story of a father and son and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis beautifully written with dialog that never rings false the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk among others in this outstanding cast the film begins with the aging father peter falk is trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him the father presents himself unannounced on the doorstep of his son and daughter in law the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip they fish play pool watch a baseball game get drunk get involved in a barroom brawl and dance with strange women but more important they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family it's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them
<START> my eyes in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days for all who wish to see this movie you are not prepared you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and urinate on you
<START> it's hard to know what was going through per kristensen and morten lindberg's heads when they wrote gayniggers from outer space the movie is billed as a comedy yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names capt b dick sgt shaved balls the rest of the movie is a presumably unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice overs with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling 'futuristic' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes and a plot that makes almost no sense br br even though 65 of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 this is the complete opposite of what a good film is it may be entertaining to watch with some friends but this film only deserves about a '2' out of ten slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie
<START> one two three four five six seven eight and back haha this is a must see first of all to see the work out there are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie it's a slasher but without suspense the ending is funny too and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the copper jesus looks like a clown the killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory there are a lot of fight scene's too and hey no one got hurt and what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that won't spoil it you must see it and being a slasher there's a lot of t a too to guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part but what about the story of the copper in the woods huh but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have i'm glad that i have my copy one of those slasher failures but man those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles if you are in your 40's then this is one is back to memory lane
<START> this is one of the worst films i've ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn't i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century i don't think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice
<START> i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s it's politics too upfront and ridiculous and let's face it i was still under a love spell known as blowup and i still haven't completely shaken it now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well good luck to me br br but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age and zp is it's own experience and is only really linked to blowup through its creator the late great mr antonioni br br twelve years ago i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size immense restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place br br what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own br br i remember the second time around seeing it the early 80s i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular whereas before these two seemed like a smart alecky shadow version of zefferelli's olivia and leonard read romeo and juliet they now were engaging me particularly the girl in her insistent slo motion ality she took her time to live everything everything dies around her br br upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment the encroaching shoulder padded big haired 80s whispered but that's a hippie fantasy let it go br br the force of antonioni's vision had i had realised already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered 80s with an uh huh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealously br br but this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back secretly jealously and possessively and you get changed br br was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup undoubtedly zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment but hey sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all br br today reality hit zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice's restaurant br br so it is still too difficult too disturbing too what br br maybe it's that as with all good art it lives while everything dies around it br br peace
<START> julia stiles is a talented young actress who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential obviously the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone it was poorly written the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care
<START> its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people a movie which has no story again shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of times i think this is to much pretty zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didn't know that there is enough facilities in pakistan for the pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities and also i didn't know that an indian can cross the march's between both countries go to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani soldier's were sleeping
<START> even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this with a string of anti military anti war movies already being destroyed at the box office it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script br br at first it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusack s all over again but only about 90 seconds into the movie it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelove br br i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one i have to say that i don't know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide tom cruise was never close to being this far gone not even close
<START> i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult i can look back and laugh and still feel sad but this time i actually know what's going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissy get married move into a trailer have a falling out cheat have an uncle die then get back together all in the course of a month only in america
<START> i don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that's what reviews are personal taste missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs taboos of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of equality guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally i thought under the skin you have to submit to the aire of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty insides excellent and actually very cruel
<START> this movie is very great the acting is fine with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman and then he goes crazy he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman beside the patients he tortures the most special effects are also beautiful although some are really fake like a drilled out tongue that has laid for 1 night outside and is still red in the morning but the torture scenes are absolutely well done though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts but for the real horror thriller fan this is a must watch
