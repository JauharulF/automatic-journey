<START> this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany br br i find the wooden horse disappointingly boring the subject could have been thrilling suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way it's a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and thrill the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge the latter half of the film is even worse they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film i am disappointed by the wooden horse it wasted the potential to be a great film
<START> a truly truly dire canadian german co production the ever wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term problem child a few uears prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the offspring now she's moved up to the northwest us to start over but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond br br unfortunately mandy schaeffer as the daughter murders more than people she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini clad bod don't help any we're supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing not to mention the fact that arquette and schaeffer don't really convince as mother and daughter all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom particularly rosanna are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago br br one of the production companies is called quality international films not since the three hour love lies and murder from two short productions has there been such a you must be joking credit
<START> the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same time br br i saw it and i was bored to death the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10 20 30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely br br the time is also a factor as they only have 50 60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster br br i give it a 2 star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it which you then of course won't do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap
<START> i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival in a small 200 seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival br br i absolutely was into it i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes it is amazing set design the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies br br and the music is so nice br br i rate this experience 9 10 br br spoilers ahead br br the documentary tells about awesome blues men with black and white old looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing it is really amazing but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock bands playing those blues songs in a modern way i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs this is the same kind of un perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club br br the documentary was such a standing ovation at this first screening in the little cinema that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open air cinema though the sand the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night
<START> this movie should be number one on the bottom 100 the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill and the story is worse i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet don't waste your time money energy or anything else on this movie thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn't spend anything on it had we i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction in conclusion i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film don't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it
<START> don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken br br such is how i felt watching this so called battlestar galactica arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains it's not what the fans ordered br br imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip steak which you loved when your meal arrives you find they've applied the name new york strip to a chicken dish you complain but the waiter merely states but ze cheeken ees really good zir do you really care if the chicken is good you wanted new york strip a steak the waiter then explains you zee zir ze chef wanted to to do as you zay zomezing new we felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called new york strip now on the menu you'll never see the original new york strip ever again br br such is the case with creating something new and slapping the battlestar galactica namesake on it br br this mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show br br it's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original the team put in charge of resurrecting bg should have loved the original series seeking to improve what the fans loved not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the battlestar galactica name br br if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show then do so give it a new name don't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers that effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future br br we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as bg because we liked something about the original we didn't simply want the name and remnants of the basic concept there are things we loved about the original series br br sadly probably the best elements of the original were those which were omitted sure the original bg was imperfect and could have used some updating this mini series however was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards br br many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream br br that being said i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself not in comparison to the original br br the battle sequences were the best part effort was obviously put into making the effects more real in appearance and less wow look at that effect i would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made for cable original movies what was the deal with this pseudo live cam some views tried to fake the effect of a real camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms however it was over used considering there was no apparent source of these cameras the infinitely more intelligent series babylon 5 is the only instance i've seen such live cams used effectively when we were supposedly witnessing action from security cams br br the script you ask the script felt like it was written by a teenager for other teenagers the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical indeed the whole story felt pieced together from other well known stereotypes the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series it was obviously dumbed down for digestion of your average tv audience br br the human interaction was pitiful rather than drama based on subtle looks expressions and fine timing every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer such was obvious in any interaction between adama and son the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention sorry but real humans don't behave like the continually br br i wouldn't have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own nothing great it will never be revered by true scifi fans or artisans but it would be watchable by the masses i personally could have lived without it though i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original br br how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers how even scifi channel has dumbed down its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market the science fiction fans it will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken despite our complaints br br i leave you with only one thought br br no moore br br
<START> man what the hell were the people who made this film on and more importantly where can i get some the opening scene sets the tone for the film a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire transforming into a werewolf and this is no rick baker 'american werewolf' transformation folks we're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here i can just imagine some stoned italian spreading glue on naked annik borel who plays daniela the film's protagoness is that a word and asking her to roll in fur that's how bad it is br br from here on in it doesn't get much better minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about daniela and her condition or something i can't remember but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry br br the funny thing is daniela isn't even a werewolf she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around understandable as she was raped as a child so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor the opening scene she can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets and she only wants to be loved things start looking up for daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't trigger her 'episodes' check out the montage here one of the cheesiest you'll ever see laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window br br daniela's luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman reminiscent of i spit on your grave daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists br br this is 100 minutes of my life i will never get back but hey that's the game you play when you're a film geek
<START> when the folks at kino video assembled their fine slapstick encyclopedia collection a multi cassette selection of silent comedies someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many 1916 an obscure one reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy as enjoyable as the set is over all this decision was an unfortunate one for one too many is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further like any typical farce this one involves deception inspired by greed panic when plans go awry and complications escalating to the point of absurdity but unlike the good ones one too many is incoherent unfunny and downright annoying it's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film making but whatever the cause by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening and by the end one no longer cares br br the only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year old babe hardy who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy in the opening scene awakening with a hangover babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed trust me that's as funny as this movie gets if you read this before seeing the first cassette of kino's slapstick encyclopedia i suggest you fast forward past this one and skip to the good stuff
<START> after watching the trailer i was surprised this movie never made it into theaters so i ordered the bluray i had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there of course it has its flaws but i can still really recommend it the animation is well done very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end some of the backdrops are just drop dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it i thought that forest whitaker's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character lian chu is depicted in this movie so overall thumbs up i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are stitch like hilarious
<START> this and immoral tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film it's not very well done some of the acting is truly epically bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young woman's sudden flip flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense they're not explained at all i also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality the central idea the idea that there's this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sex negative morality play
<START> with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is well written and the cast was knockout every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment
<START> this movie is hilarious not in good way the fights are awfully bad done while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones and even this happens only two or three times definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi's pick up a gun start shooting back and not get hurt br br the story empty guy waking up lost his memory starts fighting cos that's what he's good at five years later memories come back takes revenge blablabla br br not worth your buck not really worth your time unless you're drunk and bored
<START> this film reminded me so much of a history of violence which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble don't these men have a job anyway dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it br br sam peckinpah who made the wild bunch which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared but it was done with style and you believed it straw dogs is not believable first of all the location is wrong and does not work why place it in england i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930's or something second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife br br sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one
<START> very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas can't say much about this film without giving away the story i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture everybody has his or her own agenda nice little surprise at the end after all the other surprises well written with good performances by all
<START> i am so disappointed this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again the neurotic upper class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses woody i've seen these characters already i've seen the storyline from you ten times already where did your creativity go you need to open your eyes and look around you the world has changed dramatically since annie hall and you need to change along with it br br there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again br br when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out it does nothing for me because now i've come to expect his old standby the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating depressing and same old same old br br if woody wants to win his fans back then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated not insulted
<START> when will i ever learn the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to vent my spleen br br i will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles and all the smoking if the plan was to cheapen the characters it succeeded br br for a film to work at least in my simple estimation there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty came close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot had struck mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most br br i can't remember when i detested a film as strongly i suppose i'm a rube who doesn't dig art flicks oh well
<START> i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music br br is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children br br is william daniels' campy contemporary for the time acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s 70s demographic br br do we need all the in jokes about ny nj i can hear the blue haired broadway audience guffawing on cue br br sorry i find the whole piece dated boring the acting far too strident for the screen
<START> it's so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves but not by much as a long time student of vonnegut's works i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers at least to those that love him as i do the casting is inspired nolte is understated in triumph bewildered in defeat decisive in judgment sheryl lee is luscious throughout but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty alan arkin delivers a totally lovable but equally treacherous soviet spy br br do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though if you haven't read mother night you will probably want to after viewing the film br br notice the shifts from color to black and white and back again and don't miss the final symbolism of campbell's noose watch also for kurt vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film br br bing crosby's white christmas will never sound the same i write in mid december when the song is getting heavy radio play and it's driving me nuts
<START> the only reason that i did not give this 10 stars was the dvd format no menus extras etc however if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you this is one of the most life affirming films that i have ever seen and magical the acting is superb the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic this is one of those films that cult status used to be about i have recommended this film to all of my friends some love it some can't finish it whenever i think or feel that something is impossible i think about alan arkin's role in this film sure wish he'd make more films
<START> enough is enough sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead the first tremors movie was great the second one was ridiculous the third one was nauseating the tv series was depressingly awful and this movie just drives the stake deeper br br basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the wild west in the 1800's and they fight graboids like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again mildly entertaining i suppose otherwise this straight to video release just like tremors 2 and 3 is just going way too far oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event i think something like this would be history making so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared br br movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy avoid this garbage
