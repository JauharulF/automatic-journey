<START> i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie the lines pacing and timing of events in that film are outstanding however this european vacation sequel is a major let down br br in this sequel the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild ha ha laughs for example a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark do you want your coke in the can clark answers back no i'll have it right here that's really about the only line that is funny in this film br br european vacation's humor is strained as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie tried to re hash a script that had been done before and relied on a ridiculous slap stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time br br worse the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found their replacements are not funny can't act and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny they are in bad taste br br the griswald's should have stayed in wally world the place that made them legends don't join them on this european dreadful adventure viewers should re watch the original vacation movie in place of this you'll be glad you did
<START> i'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks my thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male whipped and tortured women merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre the opening and the hand smashing are django rip offs the shooter however lacks the style of e g django score acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here and the actors don't have an italian accent br br 4 10
<START> i have seen poor movies in my time but this really takes the biscuit why oh why has this film been made there just is nothing here whatsoever please put your trust in me flick the off switch and destroy your copy of this film there is a plot that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera this is the key problem the story 'based on a true story' mmm whatever just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes and so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around that is it in the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens apart from watching someone walk to a shop and then 3 guys walking through a wood this time could perhaps have been spent on developing character but no and so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen and so when they start to get shot we couldn't care less in fact i was in the end vouching for the baddie so that the film would end on top of this the camera work is truly horrific this director editor writer producer ti west is rubbish i hate to hit a guy but really his work is pants these dull close ups continuously and then long single takes following people as they walk i'm sure he thinks he's clever but the results are so dull i just wanted to stop the film and slit my wrists how this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me to finish the acting is also woeful which goes for the film as a whole preserve your sanity stick clear of this heap of total excrement
<START> the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the film's sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
<START> ok the director remakes love actually the director nikhil advani after debuting with khnh does his second half and wait br br he makes a 3 30 hours film which loses on patience time etc the viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this film br br ok they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why 6 stories br br we have the anil juhi story convincing but boring don't tv serials show such stories br br we have govinda shannon story which is funny and works well br br we have akshaye ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy br br we have salman priyanka story which is the worst not just acting terms it makes no sense at all br br we have sohail isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories br br we have john vidya story a good story in all respects br br but then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isn't appealing though especially the climax of salman priyanka story nikhil advani's handling is alright at places some stories are well handled but weak at places music sel is good but too many songs cinematography is nice every story is given a different look texture and it works br br actors govinda rocks after a dismissal comeback with bb he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part akshaye khanna overacts for a change br br sohail khan is too over the top and isha has nothing to do anjana suknani is dismissal br br priyanka and salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked br br salman khan doesn't act only just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her she does get better towards the end vidya balan is good juhi chawla is okay shannon is okay
<START> i just finished reading a book on anita loos' work and the photo in tcm magazine of macdonald in her angel costume looked great impressive wings so i thought i'd watch this movie i'd never heard of the film before so i had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever thought it got off to a cute start with eddy as the playboy and macdonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists the scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing i was even with the film when eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel but after a while it just started to fall apart for me eddy stays asleep for the entire rest of movie so it's all a dream whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter because he's just dreaming the rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless i had to force myself to stick with it and the final number where macdonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky br br had eddy woken a sooner and the original story continued or had he really married an angel i think it would have been a lot more interesting i wanted to see more of her real character br br there weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical the first few songs were good but the jitterbug number that macdonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard completely wrong for her operatic voice even so eddy and macdonald still manage to shine showing what true stars they were
<START> this is a film that can make you want to see it again i especially liked the way it ended i did not see the end coming but when laws was not blown away the first time one suspects he will be back again br br the story is gripping and could have been more psychological but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that br br hard to believe michael jr could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away but i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell br br some have complained about hanks as a gangster i believe that isn't justified if his character had been any harder he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not br br eight stars for this one although it was released in 2002 i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd
<START> i wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this with puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to cruella's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child br br the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids br br i don't know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level the puppies are cute but this movie is spotty at best
<START> guy de maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man a poor man without any moral qualities he only wanted to success in a society where all the people the politic men the businessmen the journalists the women are corrupt the only king is money the maupassant hero charles forestier is going higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction poser he is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the society stapes at the end of the novel he married himself with the biggest daily paper owner's daughter in the greatest church of paris la madeleine le tout paris is there he has a fortune and more he will become a member of parliament and later a minister the useless women are out of his view but he is always keeping in touch with the pretty and the usefull women the picture the private affairs of bel ami is a story of morality it is everything but not a story in the maupassant idea why had they put bel ami in its title
<START> story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while all the action is in the end but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny but because the story is pathetic br br the funniest part is when harvey 'i'm not paranoia' keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre oscars for this guy
<START> this show is awesome and i've seen it about 6 times br br granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies but i think it's great very funny and excellently written
<START> elfriede jelinek not quite a household name yet is a winner of the nobel prize for literature her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes br br 'gobble gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception 'gobble gobble' and the piano teacher are perfect partners br br the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated it begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes we are introduced to professor erika kohut apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress a stony professor of piano she lives with her husky and domineering mum dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action br br reviewing the piano teacher is difficult beyond registering its unpleasantness what we see in the film and might read in the book for all i know is a tawdry exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on br br erika whose name is minimally used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed not quite because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies if a reviewer has to yawn extract a leitmotif why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do elrika's violently alternating moods would be it br br a young hunk walter studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments is also a talented pianist he encounters elrika at an old fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris in the glib fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme' br br repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches br br walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness hostility discouragement and humiliation br br he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex erika retains control over her lovesick swain she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges br br in the meantime chillingly jealous because of walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano playing hands br br the next big scene by passing the genital self mutilation etc has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother erika want to be humiliated bound slapped etc sensible walter is for the moment repulsed and marches off into the night br br at this point there's still nearly an hour to go the viewer can only fear the worst erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice they retire to a back room lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers his 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents ho hum br br repulsed but hooked perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor walter returns to erika's apartment can you guess what happens now it's not very deep or difficult yes he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim one moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping erika the next he's kicking her in the face having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love br br am i being unfair in this summary watch the film if you want but i'd advise you not to br br anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted but i 'prefer not to' because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love ineffectively seeks it in pornography inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears pink and throbbing under her nose belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt blah blah blah br br the world has for reasons not explained stunted her she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br at the end if you have the patience to be there there's a small twist before going to the final scene where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear soiling student with the lacerated hands erika packs a knife in her handbag for walter br br yes you're ahead of me she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves roll credits br br if this earned the second prize at cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries
<START> a group of model caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards who is the killer and why is the killer after them br br my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down however i can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awful i gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade watching it for a second time last night i can't remember what the heck i didn't like about it i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just didn't get it in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an a br br it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't get a film like this but there is something to get valentine is almost a comedy horror director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream 1996 and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesy campy almost to the point of absurdity where absurdism is a positive stylistic term on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentine's day theme br br many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichÃ© rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichÃ©d implausible and ludicrous it's as if blanks is attempting and mostly succeeding to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self aware valentine's day is intentionally not self aware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire lest some think i'm reading too much into the film it's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adult br br other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage the novel's characters setting and plot are very different from the film sellers has said while it was a fine book i didn't think it was the right story for a film so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horror thriller story centered on valentine's day while those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme br br blanks' direction is impeccable visually valentine's day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action he also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest moments br br while valentine's day is no masterpiece it's a very good horror thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions if you watch it expecting something more tongue in cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more
<START> this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie beale a mother and daughter who lived as recluses in their family mansion in east hampton ny from the mid 50s through the late 70s by the time the filmmakers find them the mansion is falling apart and the women one 78 and the other 56 share a squalid room the older edie beale is the aunt of jackie kennedy onassis and the younger is her first cousin the women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition but jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there br br at times this movie can seem exploitative as neither woman seems in the best of mental health but at other times the movie is hard to look away from little edie blames her mother for her current state and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was little edie often seems trapped in the past focused on choices she made decades ago and loves showing off pictures from her youth where she clearly was a beautiful debutante her mother seems more resigned to her fate to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead from the pictures that show a happy family to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed from what we see of the house most of the rooms in it are empty the walls are cracking and falling apart and little edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on and of course there are numerous cats running around br br at its heart this documentary is incredibly sad while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life the squalor they live in is utterly awful it's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family br br however as a documentary the film is a wonder to behold and is highly recommended
<START> 'before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies i've seen in a br br long time the acting from br br the excellent ensemble cast is incredible philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen marisa tomei is however br br criminally underused but looks amazing for her 42 years the script is excellent the story line non linear but easy enough to follow sidney lumet although not known for his blockbusters has turned out a gem with this one
<START> what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte's brilliance of the original classic story i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful much of the witty back and forth between the main characters jane eyre and mr rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor also missing was jane eyre's charismatic sense of self which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all the original jane eyre was a hero the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr rochester her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of freezing to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie the title character seemed dry and uninspired the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story
<START> hot millions is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it the movie is a tribute to the genius of peter ustinov who wrote the screen play and appears as the key figure of an enterprising embezzler the movie directed by eric till doesn't show signs of having dated as terribly as some others from that period br br at the center of the action is a friendly man marcus pendleton who before being released from prison fixes the income tax forms for the warden who is amazed of the refund he is owed by the government marcus who is a genius at numbers sees opportunities where others wouldn't he starts working for a firm that uses the latest computer for its accounting but pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different phony accounts in different parts of the continent br br marcus is assigned a secretary who also happens to have a flat in his building the inept patty is seen working as a bus fare taker who manages to make a mess of everything how she lands a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension but things are never the same in the office when the creepy willard gnatpole decides to go after her but have no fear patty's heart belongs to marcus who is an accomplished pianist and she is a flutist and they make beautiful music together br br the best thing in the film is peter ustinov he clearly understood how marcus should be played and runs away with the film mr ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzler the excellent maggie smith is also at her best with her take on patty the kind woman who adores marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in marcus' pockets br br karl malden is perfect as the american in charge of the corporation bob newhart also appears as gnatpole the man who desires patty but can't get her to reciprocate the marvelous robert morley is seen as caesar smith whose identity marcus has assumed cesar romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector br br hot millions will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company of that unsavory but charming character marcus pendleton
<START> sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film one might argue if that is so at the end of the day it's a film about guilt justice and retribution for me at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy however in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film forget the go ahead punk make my day scene that's iconic but not original but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air zooming in on the city the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology also i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed although eastwood has enormous talent as a director dramaturgy has always been his weak point see play misty for me breezy etc thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog
<START> georgia rule has got to be one of if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least 7 10 times throughout its grueling two hour course br br advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad grand daughter the viewer thinks this will be a clichÃ© light chick flick about growing up and coming together as a family br br talk about false advertisement at it worst br br after many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohan's character being sexually abused by her step father georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama comedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so on br br the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the 40 year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care br br throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most non dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy too tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you've got georgia rule br br i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etc who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed br br don't see this movie my rule br br and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand
<START> i loved the story somewhere a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film well maybe there ought to be i thought everybody seemed really human and believable what a top notch cast what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this film br br steve carell br br he really showed a nice subtle depth that touched me he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first at the cost of denying his own needs br br did he act like a petulant ass why yes he did br br and you see that's what was perfect about this film the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something and not simply acting like he was feeling something and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling and what he was feeling was denied br br denied happiness br br denied fulfillment br br denied love br br losing your love is painful beyond belief and many who do so will never feel something like that again br br beautiful film br br i gave it an eight out of ten
