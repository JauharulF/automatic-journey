<START> i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old slovenian movies seemed to have in them well in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia or did that feeling decide to pack its bags and say goodbye somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never came back or did it because for me it came back the first time i saw ekspres ekspres and it was it's old self again br br there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch the smooth flow of the story the warmth of the colors and what i appreciated the most the lack of excessive use of verbal communication something many of other not just slovenian screenwriters should at least consider there is no use for words when you can understand each other just as well yeah or better by other means in use just watch bakovic and cerar uh br br so this in only so many words is why i would recommend ekspres ekspres to all of you as a must see slovenian movie regardless of what you may heard of slovenian films if you ever even heard anything that is br br oh and that scene where bakovic is dancing to vivaldi's music a treat br br treat yourself watch it
<START> there's a lot of movies that have set release dates only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind and then put in limbo for a long time you can only wish a film as rotten as slackers remained in a coma for what it's worth which is miniscule release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela i don't like to give spoilers out but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception angela falls for david ethan intentionally screws everything up the good guys win that's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre gross humor is funny it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic animal house to the likes of contemporaries like there's something about mary and road trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far case in point ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself no one wants to watch a young man singing she'll be coming around the mountain with a sock on his penis but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old i don't know if it's the story's lack of coherence which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer and after reviewing this film you can only wish he'll go back to the profession the worst thing you can do on any film is to make it look like you're having fun because you detract from your objectives just like slackers does by burying it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags pointless vignettes and lack of construction it's like a bunch of college students got drunk took one's camcorder and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that's actually good then i suggest american pie and animal house or road trip just something that's entertaining and not dreadfully bad like slackers coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film just as she did in another bad film such as the sweetest thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot instead of a device much like this disaster if you pass by slackers at your local video store just keep on walking and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves
<START> i thought this was a truly awful film i found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times one or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog the movie covers their long and tortured courtship highlighting each break up and make up but not developing the reasons in between in any detail these reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the make up scene in bed lame even if you liked the movie br br andrea martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters but it doesn't make the film worth renting save your money
<START> apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe pacino's producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act but apparently it's how al really behaves in person br br enough rambling here's a shotgun smattering of why i didn't even make it 3 4 of the way through this 1 pretentious al always knows when the camera is on him whether he's acting as richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside it's unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery 2 winona ryder when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films or doing richard in the first place i'd rather watch bobby deerfield than this br br lastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence my god was that necessary br br it's all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
<START> ask the dust looked intriguing from the trailer and we especially like all of the actors unfortunately the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy it practically seemed to satirize itself and to no entertaining effect after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better my wife and i walked out valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense it simply was not interesting moving funny nor artistic it appears as though it were written produced and directed by a high school kid worse yet it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors not to mention our time and money
<START> i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast forwarding not only through dull clichÃ©d dialog but even dull clichÃ©d musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but can't carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they're both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one note the best part of the film to me are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body
<START> alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this the plot holds much potential for suspense john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is scarily cast against type nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable br br yes it starts to sag fairly early there are too many coincidences and an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more in the end than a love story br br it's fun to watch for garfield massey and the character performers but it's not awfully good
<START> around the late 1970's animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney's the little mermaid br br considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it's a movie with a major identity crisis br br set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a rough and tumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigar puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but br br upon realizing that he's been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface's prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie br br the concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful story br br matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j kuenster annemarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken page's mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he's had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show br br barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth's team by 1980's standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling br br on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth's better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it's over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth
<START> this movie has a very hard to swallow premise even by this genre's standards we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up anyway the film is fun for a while but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme if they were really trying to create a new freddy like horror icon they were way off the villain here has no personality no motivation and no variety 1 2
<START> while the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self respect and anger management is hardly a new thing the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy br br diana has trouble at school she just can't stay away from fighting at home her father is constantly putting her down her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train br br it would be easy to call this movie a rocky with girls i guess but that is not at all what this is about the story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy that way you can deal with more problems at once first the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie girl and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all it's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life how positive things can make you grow i don't want this to sound pretentious because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all but what i'm saying is true br br also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead it's a shame really that she has become stuck in the tough girl typecasting now because that's really not what her part in girlfight is all about sure she's a female boxer but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine br br so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist but it's lifted way above the crowd by rodriguez' performance i rate this 7 10
<START> i must say i was impressed the cinematography was amazing the frames close to perfection and the way he built up the tension around a subject that sound more like a dreadful bore is beyond be br br the film is about two narrators one seen one unseen they are both trying to explain the significant of a series of painting that caused a scandal a long time back the film is all about theories and explanations of views but the conclusion is quite shocking i must say definitely a film that deserves more than it's 171 votes br br with only 66 minutes to play out it's plot the film still felt like a complete work fantastic direction i must say far better than blood of the poet which it for some strange reason remind me a bit of br br i suppose you can call it by the slang word artsy it's pretty much just a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects but the crew and ruiz did pull it off at least for me an amazing film
<START> no this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 how else would you explain special effects pre dating an american werewolf in london disco still being considered cool and ronald reagan not being the 40th president of the united states while we're at it let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's i've seen more of that here than in happy days laverne shirley combined br br the one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad it's good category was the late great elizabeth hartman but just barely biff plays as miss montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities her call for help is evidence of this she also looks much better as miss wimp seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell she wasn't kidding br br this isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere they're just few and far between and i'm not just saying that because i like hartman incidentally teen wolf was better than this teen wolf too was better than this and that wasn't even so good br br
<START> scary movie 2 is a let down to the scary movie franchise scary movie 1 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies br br this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape br br this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch but i don't think you will like it nearly as much
<START> i read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986 it was round that time that i saw the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldn't see it in this version no back to the bbc version a wonderful time is guaranteed
<START> if you've seen other movies like this they're probably better the omega man comes to mind to the studio's credit they avoided the sprawling unnecessary big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk additionally the set up and premise were excellent four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease what's bad is everything else i get tired of endlessly stupid careless wimpy ineffective arrogant characters in a movie that pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point i rented it and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly no don't do that why are you so stupid look out etcetera a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them this one does not also there should have been a longer more involving end to the movie as well
<START> this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous 2 10 avoid it
<START> i usually start by relaying the premise of the film but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review let me preface it by saying that i'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll whose film right before this one was house of the dead 2003 like alone in the dark it was also a film adaptation of a video game almost everyone hated it well i loved it i even gave it a 10 out of 10 my point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even i hated alone in the dark there must be something wrong with it br br the premise who am i kidding attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states' budget but here it goes anyway some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the second world which was evil in nature the bad stuff wiped them out but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key later some scientist government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal and specifically this tribe decided to experiment on some kids to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world believe it or not everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice over also reading it to us then there was something about the kids being in an orphanage but the government takes them back out and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics and there are super humans roaming around and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on br br in fact the exposition never really stops it's like a neverending backstory from hell there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films maybe 25 but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf worms that invade your body and turn into snake like aliens tunneling worms underground zombies starship trooper like wars evil scientists underground lairs gold mines spooky warehouses impalements big mostly unused museums government conspiracies golden trunks pulled out of the sea nuns explosions complex backstabbing plots a very ambiguous romance car chases home invasions kitchen sinks wait i can't remember if that last one was in the film even more amazingly amusingly in fangoria 240 producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying we're spending much more time on story being very meticulous about that tara reid called alone in the dark a smarter film br br let me not mislead anyone a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else i usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting why we were there or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began it's just a random mishmash of settings and clichÃ©s as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers then when he was done he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice then reassembled it by throwing the i ching sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel which is a combination of short varied unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work but perhaps that's being too generous i'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel br br just as i tend to at least like most films i tend to like most actors and most performances it's very rare that i say that a performance was bad well tara reid was bad here and i'm someone who usually likes reid i don't know what happened for a large percentage of the film they just move her around the set like a prop they might as well have just bought a blow up doll that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother in laws br br and speaking of that dialogue a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla by that i mean that it's a lot of pseudo scientific gobbledy gook at least in godzilla films there's a campiness to it because they know how ridiculous it is and there's a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something br br just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents is difficult to say i can't say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance although maybe slater at least saw the cigar i think that's unprecedented for me br br still i didn't give this film a 1 there was some competent cinematography even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good heck even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad i actually thought the film had promise at that point but this may just be the worst film i've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more
<START> if you ever hear these three words uttered to you joe don baker be afraid br br final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo pronounced as heronimo he's an ugly slimy rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie very bad editing joe don baker geronimo ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie making the plot go nowhere fast plus he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta who looks like elaine from seinfeld and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck she must be insane br br the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women well at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable and i was happy it was finally over you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie br br it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies very weird anyway if you're up for a laugh then see this one on mst3k sometime also i've heard his other bad movie among many mitchell mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino i can't wait to see that
<START> weak stale tired cliched wants to be basic instinct but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives new insights insipid trite grotesque and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity oh wait it was only 90 minutes long it must have just seemed a lot longer i'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again i'm expressing an opinion here i guess this means i didn't like it
<START> well worth watching especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity you are expecting a big fall down story line as grey owl is unmasked as a fraud but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film br br this has to be brosnan's best performance to date he convinces admirably as the english boy playing indians the stand out scene is the return to his aunts where brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue just with expressions and good direction perfect br br the story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper i hope so br br well done dickie attenborough and cast
