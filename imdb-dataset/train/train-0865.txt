<START> i absolutely love all of tom robbins books so i was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books i knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of robbins' magic but after seeing the movie it made me never want to read the book again the movie even cowgirls get the blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book and it seems to focus more on the love connection between bonanza jellybean and sissy than anything else along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie i think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters the only actors in the movie that i thought played their roles fit to robbins' descriptions in the book were julian's friends in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie but as a huge tom robbins fan this movie was nothing but a disappointment
<START> i saw that movie few days ago this movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it you can have it this shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness hopeless and failure but if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy
<START> can you say all shock no plot there were so many unexplored directions in this movie there was no history about the room other than the deaths why was it evil what made it that way why an hour countdown then there were the unexplored things hinted at for example we saw a camera in the air vent which he mentioned but when he climbed up said vent there was no camera br br how about the fact that all the ghosts looked digital and things winked out before hitting the ground making a static noise hmmm when you put all of those things together it makes room 1408 look like a high tech spook house except that there was no follow up on that br br oh by the way electronics don't work in 1408 well except for the tv the cell phone has no signal but wireless internet works fine how many incontinuities can you possibly add i'm sorry but this film was nothing but shock after shock it's all been done before reflections in the mirror things just out of site changing paintings bleeding walls the oh it was all just a dream no it wasn't and if the room was evil why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway it just didn't make sense br br additionally there was no background information about the first book that he wrote just some vague information about the dad was a jerk and so forth speaking of dads what was with the bit about his father you'll be in my place br br overall a truly horrible movie it was 100 adrenalin shock factor without any new or innovative effects and certainly no back story character development etc br br my overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the cheap pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots and was nothing but an effects film of recycled cheesy seen that before effects
<START> the man in the moon is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent director robert mulligan magically re creates screenwriter jenny wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting lyrical musical score this film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times br br this film is incredible all the acting first rate especially sam waterston and an astonishing performance by reese witherspoon in her film debut you will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the trant family farm comes to a conclusion br br the man in the moon was a limited release in 1991 and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art this film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest
<START> ok so mr agrama's company which is involved in some dubious business with former italian pm silvio berlusconi produced a horrendous mish mash by a mr carl macek br br what is this horrendous mish mash i'm talking about well macek took three entirely unrelated japanese sci fi animated series namely macross southern cross and mospeada added tons of dialogue believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence edited the whole lot heavily for violent content added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell reba west's singing was and still is unbearable and a total outrage especially compared to mrs mari iijima and the result was an 85 episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes br br of course the mecha were cool to look at especially those in the macross saga and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good but whatever was good about robotech was not the result of macek's work or the voice talents he recruited it was because of the toils and efforts of the uncredited why would i be too bold to accuse hg of plagiarism here japanese creators those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to robotech now wish we had never been exposed to robotech the originals are so much better naturally and make a lot more sense br br robotech however did something worthwhile it prompted legendary anime creator leiji matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled for reworkings that talentless people like carl macek produce
<START> once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie it uses many of the tropes of the genre the sinister apartment suspicious neighbors apparitions mysteries hallucinations the life of the hero trelkovsky seemed surrounded by evil secret forces trying to drive him mad br br last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation if this movie is a horror movie it's only horror in the sense that a kafka novel is horror in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence br br polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness repulsion which i don't particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me rosemary's baby in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces and the tenant which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema br br trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her he wears her clothes puts on makeup talks like her but is he being possessed by a spirit or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him it's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary and which polanski never resolves that makes this such a fascinating movie many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes and it's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in br br although this is not my favorite polanski movie it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms and technically speaking it's a marvel too suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist bergman's dp in the making of this movie a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy but it's an experience nevertheless
<START> talk about a blast opening trampa infernal has the coolest opening credits ever guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary friday the 13th theme tsh tsh tsh ha ha ha the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes two extremely competitive and testosterone overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar according to a newspaper article there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid the formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers as he also uses a self made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular trampa internal is a mexican slasher survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre
<START> i got this one a few weeks ago and love it it's modern light but filled with true complexities of life it questions and answers just like other eytan fox movies this is my favorite along with jossi jagger this pictures a lot more universally than only the bubbles we may live in you don't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this i'm not but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further relationships we have to live with are superficial meaningful deep fatal you name it you don't know what's coming and you definitely don't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time it is worth seeing several times fox movies include great bonus material here a great music video and the making of including explanation of the title interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles
<START> the film is exceptional in it's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful in a way it's a slacker movie for girls watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid night movie buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined
<START> i've seen my share of woody allen's movies and while they're not always great you can usually be sure you're going to be entertained probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway '94 and mighty aphrodite '95 since then the ones i've seen have been patchy but watchable and so when i was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda which i wasn't even aware had been released yet i went along happily i hadn't really heard much about it so i hoped i would be pleasantly surprised br br what i got was definitely the worst woody allen movie i've seen the premise is over explained the cast is terrible the script is slow and lifeless too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out i assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film br br i don't mind the concept behind this film two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy and obviously the film proceeds to show us that by playing out both scenarios the problem is neither of these 'two films' are any good at all the comedy isn't funny and the tragedy isn't very tragic it seems like allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam or time to actually complete the film br br the general level of acting is notably bad also will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table and it's basically a woody allen impression previously good actors like chloe sevigny just come off as annoying and the worst of the bunch is radha mitchell as melinda which is a shame because her character is in nearly every scene br br to be fair to the actors the script they are working with is lacking if not non existent definitely a long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall
<START> i've never found charley chase very funny even though his on screen character sometimes reminds me of john cleese whom i find very funny charley chase also reminds me of gowky hen broon from scotland's 'sunday post' comics page in chase's best films i tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him i'll give chase credit that his very best films such as 'mighty like a moose' and 'his wooden wedding' have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him but i'm positive that even the most die hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'married to order' just isn't funny at all br br chase eager awkward gormless naff is a young swain hoping to court the fair rose oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father who disdains chase as a 'mollycoddle' leo white who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at essanay is on hand here as a rival br br there's some action involving an ingersoll watch i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles is this an early example of product placement br br sadly a major flaw in 'married to order' is the casting of rosemary theby as rose she's meant to be a standard issue ingenue but theby flat chested hawk faced is physically wrong for the role theby the wife of harry myers had a successful career as a screen actress but was never a believable ingenue film historian william k everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books br br i'll rate 'married to order' just 3 out of 10 and i'm being charitable because i keep suspecting that charley chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing
<START> pendragon pictures' new film h g wells' war of the worlds the first faithful adaptation of the original novel has been in development for about 5 years a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year march 2005 but this never happened the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg's version which hits theatres june 29 br br i liked this film with certain reservations br br how faithful is the adaptation it's not quite 100 faithful to wells' book but 90 95 faithful is good enough for me at least several scenes were totally new such as ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer and the unnamed writer narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin but on the whole this film follows the book very closely certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal br br its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget the majority of it seems to have been shot blue screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots and scenes of crowded city streets the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game numerous scenes in horse carriages were faked i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse the only scenes shot for real seem to be those in open fields or forests br br but within those budget restrictions they managed to do quite a lot artistically the film looks right the martians and their tripods are quite well done and very true to wells' descriptions i was particularly impressed with the heat ray although the thunder child sequence which should have been one of the film's highlights is very disappointing it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets or better quality animation br br the acting and direction won't win any oscars for the most part they are competent not bad but not outstanding the music is quite good also though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers br br i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen as it stands i would rate this similarly to a bbc tv adaptation of classic literature br br a few nitpicks most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters mostly red this may have been an artistic choice but it is used very inconsistently and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd and the writer narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene br br bottom line is it worth seeing if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations and get into the story i think you will enjoy this especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel if however you are easily put off by cheap production values you'd best pass on this unless you're a mst3k fan be warned however that the film runs a full 3 hours so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting br br btw an entirely different version of war of the worlds aka invasion came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres http imdb com title tt0449040 this was also made on a budget but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film but it's much better and to top it off jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best selling album from 1978 but that won't be out until 2007
<START> i love this show i watch all the reruns every day even though i have seen all of them like 6 time s each br br it's about two sisters holly amanda bynes and val jennie garth who live in new york holly goes to live with val when their dad is transferred to japan val has the perfect life she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the upper east side br br the show basically shows all the problems vall and holly go through the main problem is guys but also is about being responsible and other life choices br br holly is 16 and is a total free spirit while val is the complete opposite she is the organized has to have a plan to do anything kind of person br br the other characters are henry vince gary lauren and tina
<START> normally i don't like revenge films period but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise you see di has action accuracy exotic locales i e hong kong awesome gun battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat like all revenge flicks it has villains you'd love to throw out of a plate glass window on the top floor of a 40 story building however double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist racist and venomous social stereotypes that invaded eye for an eye and death wish 2 br br but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap chad and alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what i remembered the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one it wasn't the watery plot that made this movie bad but the use of clichÃ©d lines and moves from other movies from lethal weapon to the princess bride really made it worse but nonetheless double impact is still watchable but why is that shitty movies like this have villains for example that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick you would love to hate with fiber of your being
<START> i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy adventure quest of some sort br br the plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters in spite of what first impressions may give it isn't cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny the flow is quite well done nothing seems rushed or dragged out the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire movie br br my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why
<START> i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences i think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences so it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala
<START> outrageously trashy karate horror thriller with loads of graphically gory violence and gratuitous nudity and a thoroughly preposterous and bizarre plot this is lowbrow and low grade entertainment that will appeal only to viewers with particularly kinky tastes but it's kind of cheerfully bad and i must admit that i wasn't actually bored while watching it 1 2
<START> having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference br br though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of time br br though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough br br as noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the film br br i think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
<START> having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock's performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky self effacing roles ms bullock's performance in serious roles see hope floats speed 2 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the sub plot of sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catch me if can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplin's token partner love interest character br br spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of
<START> over the past year uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker cranking out the competent in the name of the king a lord of the rings clone and the proudly vulgar post 9 11 satire postal but then came seed and the counter was reset to zero keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach and i'm a fan of the guyÂhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision and are never dull br br spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received seed is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombie's successful reboot of halloween the antagonist is maxwell seed will sanderson a mute hulking brute who's slain 666 people and sits on death row awaiting execution after unsuccessfully frying the beast he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem br br trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression ultimately resembling a washed up pro wrestler doing the toolbox murders on a succession of equally boring victims furthermore seed's character and boll's message run contrary to one another the death penalty is wrong sure but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who's left a couple hundred corpses in his wake i think not br br meanwhile michael pare acts like a listless long lost brother to james remar's character on dexter a cop who sits at his desk a lot thumbing through newspaper clippings and watching pointless stop motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seed's lair by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seed's hideout the sequence is so drawn out ill conceived the lighting is almost non existent and unexciting despite a healthy dose of gore that it almost put me to sleep br br the shoddy film making isn't limited to just that sequence seed appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly a technique that's more stomach turning than the gore itself these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering almost non existent narrative at 90 minutes the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture which might have been boll's intent all along br br pure genius i guess the joke's on me
