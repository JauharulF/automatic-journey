<START> this is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television i really wish it was on d v d br br helen hunt gave such a raw performance she played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly when she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing she is so alone so he gets to her when she talks about her mother wow br br steven weber as the serial killer was so shocking he really brought her into his dark world it was oscar worthy when he talks about killing the kids scary when he realizes who she really is what a scene br br they really don't make them like that anymore it was a real thriller without being gory
<START> a little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men br br if you are too smart to watch this movie then you are too smart to be alive br br wonderful romp wonderful premise period piece done with acute eye for detail br br walter matthau meg ryan tim robbins et al just wonderful br br rent it sit down relax take it in smile a little enjoy yourself br br then thank me
<START> de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques though unfortunately as with many of the films written by de palma himself the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale br br the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearÂ and the whole thing is revealed to be angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed she has a short scene with her son a dead ringer for harry potter which concludes with a joke that she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter she then goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist michael caine he refuses and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled br br then begins a bravura 22 minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling storiesÂ and in typical de palma fashion he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill the problem for me is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill br br the sequence begins with angie at an art museum she watches strangers all involved in sexual or family activities then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie's attraction embarrassment retreating and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio who also scored carrie br br in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy and gets up to return to her husband again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered as angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is that she has probably contracted a venereal disease and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle it's all very admirable but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor then up again almost in real time br br spoilers from here on out when angie reaches the seventh floor again she is killed by a big woman with blond hair the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there there is a wonderful slow motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator angie reaches up toward her and the killer's blade is held poised to slash nancy's hands then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror it's all good and by the time we have some dialogue again you think woah that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative or maybe you don't but i do br br a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him he interviews michael caine making the outrageous implication though it passes as commonplace that angie wanted to be killed angie's son is there as well and he hooks up with nancy and they set about to spy on caine's therapist and find out who the killer is br br once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film in this case psycho just as obsession is a re working of vertigo you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space in this case an elevator rather than a shower then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing br br it is very interesting but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around and that is my primary reservation about this film it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest setpieces but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole hearted affection br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de merde cinemademerde com
<START> i have to hand it to the creative team behind these american pie movies direct to dvd typically is synonymous with cheap incompetent film making yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel the naked mile the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy yet funny little film this year they offer up the followup beta house this is the honest truth beta house makes the first few american pie movies look like the little mermaid br br this is no holds barred tasteless laugh out loud fun sure the story is a bit thin but that's the beauty of the whole thing within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters the new supporting characters get a handful of raunchy gags meet the villains and establish the general plot line with all that out of the way the movie becomes a no limits ride the gags are a plenty and they did not hold back in this one i'm talking male semen urine dildos chicks with dicks sex with sheep female orgazim sprays and plenty more not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene br br returning from the naked mile are john white jake siegel steve talley and eugene levy in a similar supporting role as the last few films the entire cast does fine work steve talley dwight stifler in particular has a great energy and screen presence i predict good things for him the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was the deerhunter parody classic br br the bottom line is if you're a fan of the series you'll feel right at home with beta house it really pushes the limits of good taste but in the end is pretty damn funny
<START> i am a very big jim carrey fan i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura i also like him in his serious movies especially truman show this one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side he is of course very funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease he is truely a multi function actor br br as for the rest of the cast i was happy with jennifer aniston's acting i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass morgan freeman makes a very cool god as for steven carell his limited scenes are very funny especially in the anchor scene br br overall i would have to rate this a 9 good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film
<START> i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge br br first of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the women's life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is kurosawa's work of is life and i'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual range
<START> it really is a shame that films like this never snag best picture nominations because this one is simply a winner this is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy i have ever seen its screenplay and design are impeccable not to mention the incredible cast i can quote this movie for hours on end watch it
<START> dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar the movie followed with beta ishq raja masti all of whom were superb br br but then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too pyare mohan is one such movie br br though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb br br if you really want to watch a movie and laugh please don't watch this because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only br br in short the movie is worth a miss
<START> as long as there's been 3d technology 1950's i think there's been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i don't remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses this claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie
<START> have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the tigers when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things at least watching for his her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job lo and behold i spied wes craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer he'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the scream movies maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as aesop a wacky character in the movie f j lincoln from the '70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of tigers attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
<START> while traveling in the mountains a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs leaving no trace of its presence unbeknownst to the man he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br horrifically re produced from the original spanish the fury of the wolf man loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form lycanthropic paul naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual dominatrix scientist perla cristal and sexy assistant verÃ³nica lujÃ¡n never get close enough to truly titillate the often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing
<START> this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i think to believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes 2 the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks br br its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an ao or nc 17 rating i'm sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r rating or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations br br watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenes footage don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics
<START> having been a fan of 'columbo' i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano' while certainly a funny movie falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years especially with the offensive language he used after 'corky romano' i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr peter falk however having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor 'a town without christmas' for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that 'max' peter's falk's delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo' while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies and i highly recommend them whether you're a falk fan a christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel good movie of the week this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made for tv holiday flicks so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it's too late
<START> yes this movie is bad what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title in the entire movie zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice on top of that we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about either also there's no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie br br however i will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere br br i'm all for independent films but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any br br worse than scarecrow slayer
<START> oftentimes films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime whether it be the big name support or the project itself paris je t'aime never falls into this realm i believe i can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence merging characters together in one last view of love in paris i think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed true there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest but in the end i have a lasting image even if just a split second of each short vignette love takes many forms and the talent here rises to the occasion to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotion's many facets br br quartier des enfants rouges maggie gyllenhaal surprises as a drug addled actress shooting in paris and meeting with her dealer the reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off

payne's odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voice over story told of an american in paris to find what love is her harsh uneducated french is a very stark contrast to the authentic

<START> gordon parks the prolific black life magazine photographer made a true ticking timebomb of a movie here one that does not mess around based upon the true story of two nyc cops later dubbed batman and robin who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs this is a cop buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula lightning paced there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here br br man early '70s nyc must have been a terrible place to be a police officer from the looks of movies like this and serpico these two cops start out as safety division rookies busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time but instead of receiving applause from the city police department they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers they have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets ruthless drug kingpins and a nasty ghetto neighborhood br br both david selby and ron leibman are fantastic in the leads part of the entertainment is watching leibman's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance and selby's acting is low key and wry these two make all the comedy aspects of the story work displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination director parks who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography does not shy away from the grittiness of the story rather the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit adding to this realism is the fact that the real hantz and greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists it is a real tribute to the effectiveness of parks' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy br br why has mgm ua let this sit on the shelf for 30 years barely giving it a home video or dvd release in the u s it is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s
<START> late great grade z drive in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci fi soft core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw dropping stupidity in the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother like impotent bumbling idiot the controller an amusingly goofy erwin fuller however sweet'n'sexy cinderella radiant blonde cutie pie catherine erhardt remains determined to change things for the better with the help of her effeminate fairy godfather a flamboyantly campy jay b larson cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud tom prince the dorky vaughn armstrong and teaching everyone that making love is a positive pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity br br adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all thumbs incompetence staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair the uproariously abysmal we all need love number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel ditto the equally abominable mechnical man routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots louis horvarth's crude static cinematography the tacky plastic miniatures sparky sugerman's groovy throbbing disco score the copious gratuitous nudity ravishing brunette hottie sherri coyle warrants special praise in this particular department the brain numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor roscoe the robot law enforcer is especially irritating and the uniformly terrible performances renee harmon's outrageously hammy portrayal of cinderella's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy

<START> without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichÃ©d films i've ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another br br the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap br br i bought this for Â£1 but remember you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life you'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price
