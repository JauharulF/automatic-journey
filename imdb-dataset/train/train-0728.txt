<START> shadrach was not my favorite type of movie i found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par harvey keitel and andie macdowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable i also did not believe that paul's parents would go away and leave him with the dabney family especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable it seemed the dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated there was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed andie macdowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone who was it her son what was the scene supposed to show us why was the scene even included it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again it seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all there were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me the story concerning shadrach was nice but i wasn't convinced that the dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed
<START> i first saw this film 40 years ago on n y television and thought it was a depressing look at the future wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing no private airplanes the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war the concept of the future and the korda an co concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series it is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies is the worst movie ever made surpassing even the witless plan 9 from outer space at least that movie was just inept the lampoon film on the other hand is both inept and mean once upon a time movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence this one however holds a fetid rotting carcass up to our faces and then tries to rub our noses in it br br another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes and i agree misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh and very nice flesh it is but the directors seem not to realize that even t a needs a good story to surround it there's none of that here br br perversely the film makers save the worst for last the third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio in this vignette robby benson plays an eager beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job he is paired with a weary cynical oldtimer played by richard widmark for just a moment we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly surely we think the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better br br forlorn hope instead the cynic wins the day and the youngster's spark is doused forever national lampoon goes to the movies and heads right for the toilet asking us to follow it down the drain nominally this is a comedy but where's the humor
<START> br br the movie slugs is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry you see these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don't mean to do anything malicious they're just slugs slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison but slugs none the less the real bad guys are the humans who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs or overreact when they encounter them br br for example take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs they were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them and they reacted instinctively defending themselves and biting the guy now instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot spills some highly volatile chemicals starts a fire knocks a bookcase over on himself and cuts off his own hand then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes how can you blame that on the slugs br br this movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable the characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody the drunk hick who's mean to his dog and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty five years older than him there's also a set of drunken teens br br that get attacked while copulating and we have to see the skinny long haired freaks' genitals meanwhile there's a guy who looks like a demonic leslie neilson who yells you don't have the authority to declare happy birthday for some reason finally this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic pod people whose face explodes after eating a slug laces salad another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful harmless slugs br br humans are portrayed as greedy stupid racist alcoholic and in one pointless scene as would be rapists in the movie's climactic scene the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers well since they're idiots the humans succeed in blowing up the entire town they alone do more damage than the slugs ever did br br if you hate humans and i know i do you'll appreciate slugs if you're a fan of bad cinema you'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of pieces and pod people there's enough bad acting silly dialog illogical plot twists lame special effects pointless scenes and poor dubbing to hold your attention
<START> aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie wasn't too bad unfortunately that doesn't leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an infomercial instead
<START> avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000 i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba's voice i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this americanized version watch chiba's other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors
<START> nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls mischa barton as frankie and ingrid uribe as hazel although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination young hazel running for mayor seems out of place to be honest br br while the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama perhaps we've grown to expect gritty reality in movies rather like comparing pollyanna to how green was my valley never mind each of them are good in their own way br br i do admire joan plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a rarity br br i find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter thoughtful values for the growing up years and no violence thank goodness a warm family film to enjoy
<START> i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o'donnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands
<START> two qualifiers right up front i actually think joe don baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director the cape fear remake a small role in goldeneye walking tall and i even liked baker in mitchell because he was playing an anti hero who was supposed to be unlikeable yes mst3k's coverage was hilarious but they took a lot of cheap shots at baker that he didn't deserve to keep things lively and entertaining he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie and he was the best part of the movie br br final justice seems to be more of the same but in spite of the exotic locations and the cowboy frontier justice theme it is quite a bit weaker than mitchell and the main reason is that baker's character as written is an idiot the movie has the conceit that because baker embodies old style frontier machismo he challenges his opponents to old style mano a mano quick draw contests and because he's so tough and macho he always wins even when he's hurt wounded outnumbered etc br br that's a conceit with a lot of potential it worked for gary cooper even if it condemns the film to b movie status but baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy's henchman to a showdown in a public market with civilians all over the place he could have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy's headquarters which was why he was following them in the first place and they never would have noticed or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point but no he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout br br this is a guy we are supposed to admire br br the whole movie is basically like this most of the supporting actors are somewhere between ok the henchmen to pretty good the chief bad guy and his father who are two well known european actors they just go through the motions but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent but through it all baker's character pulls silly unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force br br on the positive side since 90 of the movie is set on malta or in the mediterranean you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras and really baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic but he isn't that bad certainly not the tub o' lard that this films critics including mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage seem to think br br in short this movie is good for video wallpaper but the viewer should not pay any attention to it
<START> it's the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others' success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier 'dracula' 1931 and 'frankenstein' 1931 in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves it's a poverty row feature it's not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior films br br from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesn't happen that's the disappointment br br we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clear br br do not watch the technicolor 'dr x' 1932 which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter before watching this the way i did it's an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally 'the vampire bat' still isn't that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy br br besides 'dr x' and 'mystery of the wax museum' both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwill's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in 'son of frankenstein' 1939 and as moriarity in 'sherlock holmes and the secret weapon' 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in 'dracula' 1931 as the 'young lovers ' melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but that's about it he can be seen in 'the old dark house' 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in 'the most dangerous game' 1930 then there's her 1933 classic 'screamer ' too bad more time money and rewrites weren't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4
<START> the best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno hightower puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack dundee is sure footed as ever the cast also includes many great supporters jack's wife is played by jack palance's daughter who is lovely as is reno's wife who is a great comedian i can't tell you how many times i've watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it
<START> although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows fire in space and living legend if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it i would say if you want to see the show in its original version see the video versions on vhs they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now another good video is conquest for the earth which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves overall i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers
<START> to describe this film as garbage is unfair at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining br br kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay the mad scientist story of 'hollow man' has been told before been told better and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects br br most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies in the uk they were marketed as 'the transparent man woman dog ' which is maybe where they got the title for this film br br clever special effects dire script non existent plot br br
<START> i just got done watching kalifornia on showtime for the fourth time since i first saw it back in july of 2001 you would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films that kalifornia would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996 1999 maybe it might have been more successful in my opinion kalifornia is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s it has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like seven or the bone collector many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them kalifornia is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind it tries to answer questions like why do they do the things they do is it because of something that happened in their past does it make them feel superior or powerful or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill these are some of the things that kalifornia tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves brad pitt makes an everlasting impression as early grayce when we first meet early in the beginning of the film we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual when we first see him it's late at night early is possibly drunk we then see him pick up a rock throw it off a bridge and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car pitt is fierce in this film it is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people it's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in 12 monkeys and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in david fincher's seven
<START> two years before he wrote and directed arthur steve gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for henry winkler then tv's the fonz a 1950s college thespian and all around jerk woos a co ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon to make ends meet he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling eventually becoming a gorgeous george like celebrity turning likable winkler into an obnoxious goof off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time and a sure way to separate him from his television alter ego but the jokes and situations are often wrong headed and mean staged rather sloppily by director carl reiner particularly crude is a wincing bit involving hervÃ© villechaize of fantasy island putting the moves on polly holliday flo from alice as henry's beloved kim darby looks a little out of her element particularly when surrounded by all these tv hams rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential 1 2 from
<START> terrible i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey what a disaster i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is the dialogs are just very strange and off topic the camera work at times just horrible the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get some of the side kick actors are total disaster sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
<START> br br presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system ok now that you know my bias here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out br br 1 although the basic plot lily mars judy garland goes to new york becomes a star and wins the heart of her director van heflin is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual although lily gets her big break when the star quits she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show br br 2 judy garland enough said br br 3 the supporting cast includes some really great performances spring byington as lily's mother is truely wonderful as is fay bainter the mother of the director john thornway van heflin the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie a one time actress turned theater custodian br br worth a watch for sure one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams
<START> if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport no the pure lifestyle of surfing to its perfect form this documentary has done it this documentary shows the life isn't just about the waves but it's more about the people the pioneers and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of big wave further than it's ever been br br stacy peralta a virtual legend from my early '80s skateboarding days as a socal teen has edited reams of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary but a masterpiece of the genre when his heart and soul is in the subject matter and clearly it is here his genius is fraught with a pure vision that doesn't glamorize hype or sentimentalize his subject he reveres surfers and the surfing beach lifestyle but doesn't whitewash it either there is a gritty reality to the sport as well br br there is so much that could be said about this documentary about the surfers the early history of the sport and the wild big wave surfers it profiles greg noll the first big wave personality who arguably pioneered the sport jeff carter an amazing guy who rode virtually alone for 15 years on northern california's extremely dangerous maverick's big surf and the centerpiece of the documentary laird hamliton big wave surfing's present day messiah br br there is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys and a few girls who show up on camera and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word i found the story of how hamilton's adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4 or 5 year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming and again stripped of syrupy sentimentality br br if you like surfing or even if you don't this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched if only because you're a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well done works of art
<START> or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james sbardellati's deathstalker of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword sorcery sub genre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious br br spoilers ahead br br deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer munkar obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar's possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king's place of course the king doesn't want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king's gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claws of evil munkar luckily he doesn't get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantime br br the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include br br deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guy's head the falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard br br when the character of female warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body deathstalker's traveling companion oghris richard brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even before her face br br the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig br br evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers br br there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye candy and although i described this movie as 'unintentionally funny' i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives
<START> i think jason lee has huge potential but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star the plot is awful the comedy is awful i laughed twice i think for relief because in retrospect they were fairly lame jokes i found myself scared for the future of fletch and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed not lee br br julia stiles and selma blair are hot but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out instead of this film save your time 1 star
