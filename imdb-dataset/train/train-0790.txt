<START> the fbi story 1959 was warner bros 149 minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studio's musical magician max steiner br br the movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but it's all very long winded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pity br br the film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewart's narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily chores br br another plus for the movie is max steiner's remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the picture's gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latin american music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included samuel bronston's naval epic john paul jones the charming rom com cash mccall delmer daves' seminal western the hanging tree and daves' a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer place br br the fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to biroc's rich colour cinematography steiner's wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchable br br classic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with 43 people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
<START> this film is totally garbage some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class nothing more than a piece of self complacence catharsis disgusting br br if this kind of a movie is set in us it will sure make itself a big joke and simply because it comes out from 'the other side' it makes itself a masterpiece a wonderful amusement for certain brain washed and or brain washing westerns some george w maybe a typical cold war sequelae some kind of joke anyway br br i would say if this like expressed in this film is all what soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through but no 'cause like many others i've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding soviet intellectuals for example something also relevant with dog white bim black ear both gavriil troyepolsky's book and stanislav rostotsky's movie is a real masterpiece real life real tragedy real sad real pride and dignity one of the real best of the soviet era
<START> this movie is bad it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video only worse the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie
<START> chilling majestic piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an ice cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red poker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind the setting is perfect in a desolate winter hideaway the quietness of the moment is a character in itself as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrance's mind wallows in this idle time and breeds the devil's new playground i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given therein needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims this film is a perfect example of this very thought br br and it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas the clackity clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set mis arrangements that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown i have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit but then again i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe i should keep my two cent criticisms over a superb film to myself all in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity br br rating 9 10
<START> this game was made by sega being made by sega i didn't expect much but i also didn't expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldn't even be worth renting
<START> poorly structured badly written loaded with cliches and flat dialogue not a single scene shines the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises plot twists or conflict you know from the first ten minutes where it's going br br for a movie set in ny it has almost no feeling for the city there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget this one seems like it was shot in toronto br br if you cast natasha henstridge why dress her in baggy sweaters why make vartan look boring and drab where's the attraction i felt like i was watching a sub par christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing br br steven feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
<START> and it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject with a little help from wagner br br maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out without the syberberg film to compare it to which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources i actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film all i know is the german version is pure magic while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes br br the music la musique isn't even credited here on imdb but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th 14th centuries or something well it isn't a great help to the film it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy comme le frommage mon cher br br rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive too and that doesn't help matters syberberg's parsifal was adorable and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented br br i shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty but even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer i'm afraid br br points for earnestness for chutzpah but this film simply needed beau coup more bucks it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheapo bon marche oh and yeah it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected blah
<START> when i rented this i was hoping for what reign of fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts br br instead i got a standard monster hunts stupid people in remote building flick with bad script bad music bad effects bad plot bad acting bad bad bad br br only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies in theory
<START> lisa baumer ida galli is the adulteress wife of a big businessman who inherits 1million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business tripÂ initially she is suspected of being responsible as her husbands will had recently been changed and so she has an insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton and an interpol agent on her tail just to be sure baumer travels to athens greece to cash in her inheritance but insists on having it in cash a dangerous turn of events lynch who's identity is now known to baumer tries to protect her against a lover of her husband lara florakis who nevertheless along with her henchman sharif tries to kill them both for a share of the money that she deems she is entitled to and this is where our masked killer starts his her brutal killings lynch as is customary with our hero is at first suspected by the greek police and is warned not to leave athens by police inspector stavros luigi pistilli a familiar face in giallo and spaghettis lynch is then aided by the gorgeous clÃ©o dupont anita strindberg a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings to say any more could ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it so suffice to say there are enough red herrings and most of them plausible to keep mystery thriller fans happy in this story driven giallo the no shame dvd has a superb transfer with both english and italian soundtrack it also has a very catchy score just for good measure by bruno nicolai that will stay in your head for a while all in all a first rate giallo
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clichÃ© lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> i don't know how to describe this movie it's definitely one of the weirdest movies i've seen in a long time it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore splatter i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling br br the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone but if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for br br if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a try br br my rating 4 10 maybe a little too weird for my taste
<START> i may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel the original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward put these two actors in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad
<START> i have two good things to say about this film the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction however that said i found this film extremely tiresome watching paint dry would have been more entertaining it seemed much longer than 97 minutes beginning with opening sequence where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone the movie is annoying the film is filled with clichÃ©s and shtick not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk also the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears there are some sequences that are touching but they're all played for laughs if schmaltzy sentimental and cute appeal to you you'll love it but if you were hoping for something with more substance see a different movie
<START> the running man along with total recall is my favorite schwarzenegger movie no this isn't 2001 but it's not meant to be and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen a state sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against heroic stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons the runners are equipped with none in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood the ultimate prize for a winning runner freedom or so the rules claim br br for a movie with such over the top gory death scenes and cheesy one liners it really does have a lot to say someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture government presented in this movie so i won't go into it here suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie you will enjoy it very much especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination like i said it's not trying to be a serious art film but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot em up flick the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman aka stephen king short novel but diverges fairly strongly from its source material especially towards the end the book ends rather nihilistically needless to say this movie doesn't i enjoyed both but i like the movie better br br my favorite line guess it's caused from steroids
<START> well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn't really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldn't reccomend it i gave it 2 out of 10 b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 1 50 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you'll like this one
<START> i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites dust squalor selfishness rudeness malice and decay i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager luckily for me my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this so far but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey simply put the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race this film is the sum of many many instances of great acting and great casting as some performances were done in english the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others and others in french with most other characters and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french i heartily recommend if you happen to be bilingual to switch the audio from french to english and vice versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd this film is part of polanski's so called apartment building trilogy which also comprises repulsion and rosemary's baby unfortunately repulsion still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 needless to say the three films would make a magnificent boxset
<START> i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and again br br set in hungary a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor kralik who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan's innocent klara kralik secretly becomes klara's pen friend and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his kralik's letters clearly kralik is besotted with klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the pen friend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all want br br other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role this time as the shop's owner hugo matuschek felix bressart as pirovitch kralik's confidant joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant vadas so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning br br finally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over confident upstart of a shop junior pepi katona br br recently re made as you've got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me is not as good as the original although i suspect younger audiences would disagree br br if this film is on in your area over christmas i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy
<START> this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other br br the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it's really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime network br br there was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me br br by the way sally field looked about 15 years old in here
<START> scarecrows seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film a group of thugs pull off a paramilitary like robbery of the payroll at camp pendleton in california they high jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to mexico along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows these aren't just any run of the mill scarecrows they can kill the acting is no better than the horrible dialog and the attempts at humor are not funny very low budget and shot entirely in the dark br br the cast includes ted vernon michael david simms kristina sanborn b j turner phil zenderland and victoria christian
<START> i stumbled onto this movie when i was ebay'ing caesars palace stuff as i'm enamoured with its rich vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition unless you count bally's the original mgm grand in that respect this movie delivers full force you're given a grand tour of the caesars property which in spite of all the renovations and additions they've done over the 40 years it's been open looks alarmingly similar as a film overall the plot is somewhat difficult to follow thanks in large part to the horrendous editing and when i say horrendous i'm not using that word lightly there's a lot of spliced in second long snippets of vegas traffic casino crowds and even a scene where the robert drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up and without any explanation he drivas goes in those infamous snippets from being himself to a baby to a little boy and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father that doesn't give away any plot details if anything one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as i was by the editing the film has aged well otherwise and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion
