<START> i just saw this last night it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation's 'passionate eye' series it has been screened recently sept 2003 at the toronto international film festival as well as many others it is a quite remarkable film the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story being there to make a documentary about chavez himself instead they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded they had unprecedented access to events and people and for the most part let the story unfold as it happens they of course have their own ideological perspective which they make evident but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events the people and the background and history leading up to the coup as a film it is not ground breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense and that is i think the way it should be what we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy a charismatic leader chavez who actually cares for his people a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate military media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds br br
<START> this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive '50s '60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work look at the funny silly people with the ghost glasses but it's also affectionate and lively with particularly bright commentary from john waters who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time and from castle's daughter who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft we never find out what became of the other castle offspring the movies were not very good it makes clear but his marketing of them was brilliant and he appears to have been a sweet hardworking family man fun people keep popping up like straight jacket 's diane baker who looks great and anne helm whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on the tingler and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castle's talent not very high but very energetic a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie going days
<START> when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline dirty harry is at it again whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy sudden impact retains all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful tight pacing a compelling plot strong supporting characters endless gunplay and bone dry humor some of these elements are not only retained but amplified this is easily the darkest bloodiest and most overtly right wing installment of the franchise br br the plot is somewhat intriguing after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums inspector callahan is sent on a forced vacation by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of san paolo he is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his no doubt considerable misery by a second shot to the head early on in the film the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer an artist named jennifer spencer sondra locke who is hunting down the thugs who gang raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback snippets of which recur before each new murder as more bodies start to appear with the same m o it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest guess who know more than they are telling to make matters even more complicated the one time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard br br sudden impact offers relentless action from beginning to end clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax sondra locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character that having been said it is fair to wonder if another actress who was not eastwood's off screen companion at the time could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role theresa russell and cybill shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert popwell as harry's partner horace paul drake as the psychopathic mick and the truly scene stealing audrie j neenan who portrays the vicious ray parkins br br however the film has some notable problems some of the subplots the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums a mob vendetta against him take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story their only real use is to raise the body count to absurd levels in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat and mouse game between callahan spencer and her former tormentors assumes prominence this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given sudden impact the potential to be a first class neo noir style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough 44 magnum heroics to satisfy the harry loyalists instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros clearly wanted to make a superbly executed but prototypical eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience br br this was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box office and it is not hard to see why though not the film that it could have been this is still big trigger happy fun even after repeated viewings it's going to make your day
<START> this film originally released at christmas 1940 was long thought lost a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd now for sale don't buy it the film is unspeakably terrible the casting is poor the script is awful and the directing is dreadful br br picture roland young singing and dancing and that was the highlight br br perhaps this movie was lost deliberately
<START> with this film bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity' obviously it is not for one reason many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set ups when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film that is goitre a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research heck if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre' he might have ended up telling the truth about these people still doubtfully instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as 'cretins' again and again dramatizing the action setting up scenes to create the spectacle all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all mighty objectivity bunuel talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming he talks for them and even then judges them this piece is flawed to it's roots to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film
<START> this film is the freshman effort of stephanie beaton and her new production company while it suffers from a few problems as every low budget production does it is a good start for ms beaton and her company br br the story is not terribly new having been done in films like the burning and every friday the 13th since part 2 but the performances are heartfelt so many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft br br the story deals with the murder and possible return of a disfigured classmate the others are sworn to secrecy but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes ten years later the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as the bagman who will survive you have to watch br br if you are roger ebert or any number of arrogant critics you probably shouldn't bother but if your taste run more towards joe bob briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft then check out the bagman
<START> the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but don't let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple bad br br it's not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack some good songs and that is why i give 2 out of 10 if it wasn't for the music it would of been 0 out of 10 meat loaf is a horrible actor at least he was in 1980 and the girl who plays the groupie isn't even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises
<START> while the title before the devil knows you're dead comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into br br the cast is well assembled with philip seymour hoffman ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable br br the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts that being said the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through all in all a pretty impressive debut for first time screenwriter kelly masterson br br sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn't a major distraction br br in the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience
<START> this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex they also get scared of little kitty cats they get set on fire by them the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn they are bullet proof invisible and what not the star of the movie clovis is the cops cat clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien and after the mom kills the cops clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire this movie sucks it was way way more funny than it was scary it wasn't even scaryt at all the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera it knoks him out she then goes and hugs her the then grabs her and begins to rape her once again clovis comes to the rescue
<START> i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this br br i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this
<START> this was so lame that i turned the dvd off maybe halfway through it was so weak i couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made it though i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different i just couldn't buy it i don't really blame the actors because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat i did find myself laughing a few times but i don't think those lines were intended to be funny br br it's only saving grace is that i bought it in a 2 dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone
<START> cinematography compared to 'the wrestler ' a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer and then hypnotizes as well br br acting the dialogue is minimal but the pauses and silence poignant br br story the conflict in a 'balkanized' denmark is volatile as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france while i harbor no love for islam the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebration br br the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion not so much in the ring but to all those around her even her worst i will stop here to avoid the spoiler
<START> after the already disappointing final conflict the series hits rock bottom with this very weak fourth entry at least the third film tried unsuccessfully to continue the story of damien while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the omen animals are afraid of the antichrist the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid
<START> a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan i like ms park the korean lady the doctor has possibilities haven't sorted out the other males except for the black guy he's a really likeable bakula needs to find his niche in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics the heavies were ok although i didn't like their make up
<START> i really enjoyed this i got it thinking it was going to be a documentary but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun br br i think this has been well done pretty much an extended tv show into a film but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style innocent way br br if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy this br br q
<START> i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about jason lee looked like he was having fun the long dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter selma blair seemed to be punching a time clock but then again her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud so well done i guess jim brolin was surprisingly funny being married to babs can't be a picnic the soundtrack was hip and eclectic larry miller who played julia stiles father hilariously in 10 things i hate about you is funny here as well he's great but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles i could spend two hours watching her fold laundry and i feel like i just did
<START> nothing could have saved this movie not even superman br br ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways ugh br br avoid this one at all costs br br
<START> every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around this was that movie for me br br i can tell you the whole plot exactly i must have seen it 100 times at least and i can say it is a good kids family movie br br i still have the tape i haven't watched it in 5 years but maybe i'll get around to it this week and be a kid for the day br br you just have to love the care bears and their messege br br
<START> years after the fall of the last of the great corporations the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts cash a female cyborg travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant on the run from recyclers bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs cash tries to find her way to cytown the mythical refuge for cyborgs br br cyborg 3 the recycler is the third last so far entry in the cyborg trilogy the first film was originally planned to be a sequel to masters of the universe but was quickly rewritten into a standard post apocalyptic martial arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes cyborg 2 glass shadow was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder br br this film for one thing tries to be a meld of the first two films the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart cyberpunk story but unfortunately falls short on both counts the budget was obviously lower than cyborg 2 with the film being set in the desert wastelands like so many post apocalyptic action films of the 90s were shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs br br the film's story centres on a plot device that of a pregnant cyborg that is as interesting as it is absurd this film is not the first to try that idea the anime ova series armitage iii uses it to a greater extent but the film falls into the same trap that so many low budget sci fi action films fall victim to in the fact that the snags synthetic organisms featured are nothing more than androids the visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms makeup effects br br the acting is pretty standard for this kind of film with the lead actress khrystyne haje being the single worst performer on display instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant she acts all whiny sullen her co stars are much better malcolm mcdowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in richard lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain of particular note is andrew byniarski playing lynch's right hand man who would later appear in the texas chainsaw massacre remake its prequel
<START> may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent with this said soul survivors was a very very bad movie very bad br br i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script affleck is a very talented actress wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty melissa sagemiller did well and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood i don't think any of the actors really got into the script and i understand why to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement it did have the twists and turns you would expect but they just didn't lead anywhere except to more confusion i just found the ending very anti climatic because it just didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline br br i wish i could give this movie a good review but i can't in all honesty the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it
