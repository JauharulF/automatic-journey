<START> i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku but she only has a smaller part in it and her character isn't very likable however the main character played by melissa sagemiller is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent she does a very good job br br the story itself is on the face of it pretty nonsensical after a car crash some friends are possibly dead but keeps on living their previous lives while all sorts of mysterious things happen some bad guys are after them but we never really find out who they are possibly they were the ones in the other car but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious but i can't get anything coherent out of it the opening scene where the bad guys who wear some strange masks cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull cassie sagemiller back from the dead but no that doesn't seem to work the bad guys are just bad guys they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice who the hell needs bad guys br br 3 out of 10
<START> just plain good old stupid br br i mean really stupid not the good stupid like killer tomatoes or ed wood movies this is probably the most stupid movie i ever have seen to give this movie an golden turkey is an insult to turkeys to call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb people br br if this is the future of american cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after br br now i have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell off br br this is a really good movie if you are suicidal
<START> br br bleak house is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen alway one of my favorite novels i was exteremely pleased with this television mini series the late great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story over all a brilliant moving and atmosphereic film
<START> fay grim is on its face a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a wink as the sequel to his extraordinary henry fool hal hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film i've seen this year br br parkey posey is fay grim an unwitting mata hari caught between the love of her exiled husband henry fool and the questionable intentions of a charming cia operative as agent fulbright jeff goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm in a role that seems tailored to his talents he has never been better james urbaniak is fay's brother simon jailed but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry his love of his work and his sister brings a jolt of passion to contrast the dour nature of the spies which eventually populate fay's world and liam aiken is fay's oversexed 14 year old son although that may be redundant aiken's understated style is remarkably old soul for someone his age br br the entire film is shot dutch angle the off kilter style made famous by orson welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to impart a sense of foreboding in fay grim using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first deceptively clever the next for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of hartley's brilliant script something happens the film takes a dark yet strangely comforting turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes what began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama and the transition is masterful slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action and we are sucked right into the vortex br br in the end hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail told with the luxury of one able to write produce direct edit and even compose the music hal hartley has crafted a smart sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek fay grim is one part dashiell hammett one part raymond chandler and one part ian fleming shaken and maybe stirred as well
<START> when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic anytime lexi katie wright or jennifer marley shelton threw up i wanted to vomit myself it's kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents before i wrap this up i'd like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it you're in for some tears and a good time so the next time it's on tv kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies jfk rfk mlk g wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh to mention a few the conspiracy scenario involving spies big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history god help us but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy if this causes a little loss of sleep maybe it should don't take my word for it investigate for yourselves
<START> there was such a hype about a game show with bill shatner and especially right in the wake of deal or no deal and 1 vs 100 so of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show what a disappointment as ben stein so stoically and nasally says wooww br br the only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals only to find out that only a minute has passed but seemed like an eternity since you last glanced at the clock so why didn't i just switch the channel well probably for the same reason most other people didn't out of sheer optimism i mean no one really wants to think that a show with bill shatner could actually be so bad br br personally from the first 15 minutes i never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of william shatner my chief complaint was that the set was so dark watching it left me feeling depressed you kept on wanting to get ahold of a little excitement but there was just none to be had there was not even enough light on the set to get a feel of energy from the audience who you couldn't even see br br dear network people do not watch game shows to cure their insomnia they watch game shows to be excited and have a good time please do us all a favor and lose this in the vault
<START> there is no way to describe how really really really bad this movie is it's a shame that i actually sat through this movie this very tiresome and predictable movie what's wrong with it acting there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub par atleast they are all very pretty soundtrack songs if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film soundtrack score okay but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days don't even get me started on the what the hell moments here are a few killer can move at the speed of light door opens actress turns no one is there turns back there is something sitting in front of her out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill a really big one the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say where'd you get the power drill i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words i will give this 2 out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage seriously do not waste your time with this one
<START> i believe sarafina is a tremendous effort of whoopi goldberg besides her there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character sarafina since i work in a high school with urban children i think this is an important film to show south african history of apartheid sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student sarafina i bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore i watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers but i strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand now while i don't know the other actors and actresses in the film i assume that they are very popular in south africa and i am glad that they filmed with a south african cast and crew with the exception of goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie than whoopi reaches worldwide appeal
<START> this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990's versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980's period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey br br the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it
<START> nyc model alison parker cristina raines rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman chris sarandon goes about making inquiries on her behalf she struggles to maintain her sanity not to mention her will to live as her experiences take a toll on her physical mental and emotional health br br i don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it the story is interesting and entertaining but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real scares or for that matter any atmosphere it is sort of quietly sinister but it's not like the traditional horror film it's more of a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life on that level it works but it's not quite powerful enough br br what the sentinel does offer are some eye catching set pieces in particular the fascinating fabulously creepy climax and there's a scene with beverly d'angelo that must be seen to be believed there's also some gore to be seen but not very much an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menace br br no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast some of them don't get to do too much but to see all of them together is impressive eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as respectively a hard nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor other legendary names include jose ferrer arthur kennedy and ava gardner future stars like d'angelo christopher walken tom berenger jeff goldblum make brief appearances and other familiar faces include jerry orbach sylvia miles william hickey and martin balsam whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize br br written for the screen by director michael winner probably best known for the death wish series that he did with charles bronson from the novel by jeffrey konvitz br br i wouldn't consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining br br 7 10
<START> i got the dvd from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production i have to say i was very disappointed the subject had so much potential the sets in a wagnerian production must of necessity be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience instead what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention i found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas i was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production that did come across fairly well and next time i am at the opera i am sure i will remember that part if this video but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation
<START> it's the worst movie i've ever seen the action is so unclear work of cameras is so poor actors are so affected and this lamentable 5 minutes of arnie on the screen my advice from the bottom of my heart don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture
<START> john candy need we say more he is the main reason you should see this film most people don't realize how gifted he was as an actor witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk just a simple subtle facial change and off we go there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john in a trance goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend i'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude it is but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty both sctv alumni with candy are not given enough to do in the film levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the end think rod serling and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid i give this one 4 out of 10
<START> comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false shaw's play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth br br on one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fiancÃ© and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she rescues him knowing that she'll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships br br it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class constructs on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw's best works br br arms and the man is both an amusing and thought provoking movie that retains its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure the play has flashing wit buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms a good example of shaw's dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis i'm a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i haven't to you're only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotel keeper's son bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different br br the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically shaw's arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war
<START> talented detective mr philo vance william powell cancels his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more a rather deliciously complex murder br br as far as murder mystery films go it just doesn't get any better than this one populated with suspicious characters all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim archer coe it's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one's head around it but boy does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us even the cops the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one's proceedings and amping up its overall fun factor i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner played by etienne girardot who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one's running time also eugene palette's detective sgt heath provides welcome often later delightfully humorous at his expense critical commentary during vance's investigation i cannot think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it hasn't dated particularly well doesn't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one's mystery highly recommended you try
<START> if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone br br just people with a sense of humor br br for those people the movie is great it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone most of witch where b rated themselves along the lines of spaceballs and airplane 2 you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes but it is well worth it
<START> it brings to mind the writings of stephen king and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like it as the exact opposite there is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends who are still friends 20 years up the line remember or seem to suffer from up the line all is described as friendly jostling maybe periodically described as picking on one or more of them but all is forgiven there is no angst embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons more mature but basically still the same people and the same power structures br br totally amazing not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions but also that friendships can in fact last in this respect this movie is a tiny pearl as one assumes this has been the intent of the film a portrait of unforced emotions binding people together which when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood the violent inhibitions in bowling for combine is what easily springs to mind but since mid 80'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood accompanied by 1000s of commercials animations and series directed straight at children several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up the abuse the loneliness the push to excel resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds br br and here comes a film that says it is possible to have a happy childhood look'a'here br br thank you for that or the counterweight illusion br br 8 10
<START> i found this film to be an utter dissapointment the talent available to the director notably stanley tucci chris walken hank azaria and alan arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire stereo typed characters julia roberts is feeble zeta jones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour crystal just plays his same old hyper active neurotic annoying alter ego and cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole project br br for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy' there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible spoilers well the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever spoilers azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick dogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead spoilers we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog pure genius br br for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross out teen movie' humour at times br br a very poor 4 10
<START> when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomon's mines i was very excited i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure what i got was a 4 hour long with commercials epic that was very slow the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it the ending was good no spoilers here but i was still left wanting more well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does roadhouse 2 so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous until than if your a fan of king solomon's mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours
