<START> this was one of the highlights of st tng's semi forgettable second season before they 'grew up' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond this was not only a showcase for up and comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher but was also the continuation of data's search for his 'humanity' this time through the concept of comedy still one of my favorite episodes br br on a side note i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst after teri hatcher's character before being rudely interrupted by lt worf i remember watching this episode 'first run' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey marvel girl br br it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is
<START> my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl there's no kissing sex scenes hollywood should learn more from korean productions sex is not always required in a good romantic movie br br the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie i like the part when ji hoon almost kissed su wan the funniest moment is when ji hoon punched su wan's first love because he dumped su wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon how he became a father was revealed in the next scene which brings smiles to the audience br br mao points 8 10
<START> it's a poor film but i must give it to the lead actress in this one francine forbes she appeared to be acting the least and i personally thought she was kind of cute too bad she only appears in one other film in the database besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes people get stabbed and they gush like 2 gallons of blood but if you like to watch poor horror films i recommend this one highly
<START> flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe inducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didn't figure it out after about 40mins you're not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll br br i don't mind 'slow' movies but they've got to be going somewhere this one doesn't br br the plot wasn't what made this a direct to dvd movie that's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy br br the as of writing 37 ten 10 ratings must be from people involved with the production
<START> it's the f b i starring reed hadley with an all star guest cast the film begins with an accidental convenient kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn't really indicate the main story which is a big house u s a prison break story the story is very improbable to say the least it's like a tv show only more violent for the times br br but the cast is a trip picture this ralph meeker is sent to prison his cell mates are the following criminals broderick crawford lon chaney jr charles bronson reading a muscle magazine and william talman reading a detective magazine honest you should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending voiceover if you don't want to have that hanging don't miss the opening scenes between the iceman and the boy peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic br br big house u s a 1955 howard w koch broderick crawford ralph meeker reed hadley
<START> branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic branagh plays iago better than i've seen the character played in film or on stage some might say this film is overly iago centric but i disagree fishburne the first black othello in film history ironically delivers a powerful performance fishburne has always been a good actor but this performance as the moor of venice may be one of his best br br the one problem i have with this film is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes desdemona's character is given far less depth than she has in the play in this film she might as well not be added at all one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between iago and desdemona at the beginning of the second act this part of the play shows that desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film there were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film br br however if you have not read the play or seen a film version of othello before i recommend this movie the story cut or not is still incredibly enthralling the acting as stated previously is very good if some important scenes had been added and desdemona's character been prioritized a bit further this would be a great movie as it stands it's still an admirable version of the original i give it a marginal recommendation
<START> i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed i have seen 4 versions orson welles is still my favorite mr r though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york although they were both a bit too old for the role i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox i would love to see those two do jane eyre by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version i think i was jane eyred out but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw i always want to go back and read the book again
<START> herculis puaro is in general a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not agatha's mistake the cast isn't good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 woman in the iraqi desert the 'victim' is not likable
<START> wow i payed Â£3 50 to go see this movie at the cinema cant believe i wasted my time the acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life i swear to god 'swept away' is better than this madonna should of won and oscar compared to these guys an hour and a half of my life i want back honestly people don't see this even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden theses guys here of the actual puppets pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it
<START> that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film first off the computer effects are absolutely mind blowing those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back the rest of the movie though br br none of the characters act in a realistic manner especially in the aforementioned despicable 3rd act i promise i won't give it away but trust me it's not worth keeping a secret a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work please give the viewers more credit than that br br some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting what would you do after all if you were invisible no one could catch you these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933 there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once later on if more attention had been paid it kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense br br the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner but this piece of work go see something else or don't and live with the consequences br br 3 10
<START> and if you're very very good it will resemble moon over parador br br this film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spot on dreyfuss was perfect as the actor impostor full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes br br this was one of dreyfuss's best roles just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator and the parting scene like something out of casablanca indeed br br raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police he gets some really funny lines some of which are homages to other films like round up the usual suspects br br and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend in addition to being a really hot number you should get an oscar for tonight br br let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves sammy davis jr ike pappas dick cavett all perfectly done br br all in all a memorable romp under the paradorian moon br br r
<START> i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carroll's 'alice' books i was very excited about this movie's premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i'm enthusiastic about modern re tellings if they are treated well usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman's work also i'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance off was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the film br br what a joke don't see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry
<START> the story is extremely unique it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time friends and mentors br br the ending could have been fantastic it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad br br the animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity i actually found it to be somewhat decent the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess br br overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
<START> ok its not the best film i've ever seen but at the same time i've been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way br br and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling br br overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it
<START> they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camp's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says how weird it's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face
<START> this movie changed it all for me i heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done hey i was an 11 year old kid from holland when i saw this movie this all changed i got actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city started breakdancing and writing lyrics br br to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wide shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody it's what it does to you personally that counts
<START> hayao miyazaki's second feature film and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically though his debut nausicaa aka warriors of the wind is considered by many fans his best 'tenku no shiro rapyuta' aka 'castle in the sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'kiki's delivery service' 'mononoke hime' and 'spirited away' but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime it's important to remember that 'castle in the sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'akira' and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero heroine villain type characters and the story is quite predictable and obvious at least in today's standards miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before while the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable if not as breathtaking as 'spirited away' and if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces at this point miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of japanese cartooning you'll see miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'spirited away' and mononoke while 'castle in the sky' being a sci fi adventure and very suitable for children fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since his motifs and principles still show and play an important part to say much more would be to ruin the movie so i'll kindly shut up suffice to say that i'm giving it only nine stars because if i gave it ten i couldn't go any higher for 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' and that would be a crime br br as in most anime movies i recommend watching the japanese version with the english subtitles even if you don't speak a word of japanese the english overdubs just don't tend to be very good and in this case it's just horrendous you might want to watch it in the english version once though just for the laughs and for the star filled cast the english dub was only recorded following the success of 'spirited away' as it was for 'kiki's delivery service' anna paquin and james van der beek yeah the dawson guy fill the lead roles mark hamill luke skywalker from 'star wars' in case you don't know plays the villain and other roles are filled by andy dick tres macneille the simpsons rugrats animaniacs michael mcshane friar tuck from kevin costner's robin hood travesty and mandy patinkin hello my name is inigo montoya good for a laugh or a few laughs really but watch the japanese one first
<START> the original trancers is not by any means a great movie it had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic however it was entertaining better done than most low budget b movies and could be surprisingly witty unfortunately trancers ii is none of these br br trancers ii suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels the plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid it seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn't bother with anything else not even veteran b grade actors like tim thomerson and jeffery combs were able to drag this film out of the muck br br a brief plot overview jack deth thomerson is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government trancers ii takes place six years after the events of the first trancers jack deth is married to lena helen hunt the woman he met in the first movie and both live with hap ashby the man deth was sent into the past to protect it is discovered that the brother of whistler the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill ashby complicating jack's mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop whistler's brother and now jack finds himself working with her br br i have two real problems with this movie one is that the method of creating trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie what makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of soviet revisionism they act like it was always the technique br br the other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between deth lena and alice stilwell jack's first wife is given very little screen time this bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie it felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie alice's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he's re married making her either very shallow or very poorly written br br the only reason i can think of for watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire trancers series currently totaling six movies otherwise even if you're a fan of the original trancers stay away from this tepid sequel
<START> ok i know that the wanna be john hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty low br br still after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can't seem to get out of my head br br i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them br br the acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult and the rowing scenes unexciting uneventful and inaccurate br br unless you've got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays or i guess rob lowe fetish there's really no reason to see this one
<START> just once i'd like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem yet again after watching this sci fi presentation i'm disappointed br br i'm not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires the story is exciting enough why add plot elements that are non existent and ruin the story what's wrong with being faithful to the text br br grendel is immune to weapons of any kind why introduce some super crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer the fight with grendel was beowulf vs grendel that's it no one else took part in the battle the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons the mistake made by all previous challengers yet in this version danes and geats fight the beast and beowulf hacks off grendel's arm with a sword again why couldn't they portray what really happened personally i think a one on one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting br br overall this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale why add in a pact with hrothgar and grendel's mother that includes sacrificial offering why create extra characters like finn that add nothing to the story there was no love story in the poem they couldn't even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake they fail to notice the metaphor that grendel's lair signifies Â it's supposed to be underground to represent hell why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot then that would be a truly great movie
