<START> first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated so it's rocky viewing in places but i've seen and survived much worse br br it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging no parking signs in latin in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump both him and beery are after the girl through the ages a never ending tussle favourite bit as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera an amazing second or two br br great stuff reaffirming my love of silent film comedy
<START> to quote the film it's better not to know better still to forget best of all to be abandoned oh the irony br br a ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film and you feel like you're being preached to from the start br br it's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show fitting maybe for a film like the hitcher not a russia set horror film the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly not scary or meaningful
<START> zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read it was made during the huge midwest flood of 1993 when half of missouri was underwater buildings were under water cars and houses were underwater one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle it is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma filter it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters and it is fast paced and energetic and really funny br br a toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies the local government covers it up tears down the factory and builds houses over it some ground shifting causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community from there it just gets crazy and gory and fun br br i have read these reviews on here a few times and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer using fake names they use the same words and sentences zombie bloodbath is cheap it is raw it has some bad acting so does half the movies made there is much much worse out there than this fun movie if you hate this film so much don't buy it there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast trailer trash and it is obvious you are not from australia or england it is just upsetting that this great service the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others there are bad reviews and good reviews and i don't mind those i give both bad and good reviews myself but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie sad br br some of these so called reviewers even basically sue their review just to promote their own movies one called this film boring well love it or hate it one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring it moves fast and never has a dull spot br br oh and this reviewer from the netherlands um liar you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got yanked there the same review only it said it was from missouri br br this nonsense has to stop love it or hate it give it a real review or type nothing it is obvious you have not seen the films br br but for the record i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen it is far from the worst and even the worst i would give an actual revoew and would not attack the director personally br br hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here
<START> this film was on last week and although at that time of the day around 6pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on mexican tv i couldn't switch the tv off the story about madelene moore really touches you she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting compliments to brooke i hope to see her in another film soon
<START> i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming boring and not funny at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable i didn't like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed br br i don't recommend this movie
<START> first i would like to say how great this it is astounding and sometimes shocking and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie i can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring it is like a trip through humanity its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers voight and hoffman who build a mutual friendship joe buck voight a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women soon he meets rico 'ratso' rizzo hoffman who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent ratso becomes joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso's dream spot florida the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life
<START> a best selling book about honour killings in jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after allegations surface that the story has been fabricated associated with other allegations of its author's past as a con woman a few years later she resurfaces conceding that she took a certain amount of dramatic licence but willing to cooperate with a film maker to prove the substance of her allegations what follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality someone who's behaviour on one had makes no sense unless what she is saying is true yet who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but unproven at best and most often verifiably false it's almost impossible to imagine what ms khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film vindication celebrity all she does achieve is to project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual and even that cannot be taken at face value director anna broinowski appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses and increasingly exasperated to boot but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable although scary and disturbing tale to tell and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in
<START> i have never seen such terrible performances in all my life br br everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish br br not one decent actor actress in the whole film it was a joke br br reminded me of drama at school
<START> even though there are no new episodes and it is rarely showed i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch i never got to see the last episodes but i do want to know what happened to miles or josh and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good i'm sure the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of s t t w because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day i really hope that she picks harvey and may i say nate richart is hott too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame as the show continued the jokes began just to get stupid and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at i would think it was so lame don't get me wrong at some parts it was funny but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter now that the show has ended
<START> mislead by the terrible lie on the cover fun as american pie my girlfriend and i sat in front of the tv waiting for a comedy and this is definitely not one you probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those jackass like ever teeny minds it's not even an erotic movie which would at least been something given that it's about sex br br so what is this the erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity zero in originality i remember losing it for one and his gang of friends the rest of the characters i e the girls just come and go for no credible reason come on there are even dwarfs so simple dwarves are fun ho ho the acting is very tv like as is the video look throughout the movie and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls br br awful movie amateurish badly produced and over all not funny kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes other than that don't even think of renting this movie
<START> this is an excellent film tom hanks and paul newman performed great i was really surprised when newman was beating on his son that was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good i was very surprised about the end rent this film today as it is one of tom hanks' best
<START> the sopranos now preparing to end is the very peak of adult television and drama when the sopranos hits the mark it really hits the mark using great writing and great actors most of them being extras from goodfellas the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way heading up the cast is james gandolfini who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano and edie falco who certainly holds her own the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary usually violence and foul language tony sirico michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi great joe pantoliano great david proval good robert patrick robert loggia and frank vincent br br the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv symbolism and simple story lines dreams and shoot outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package watch it
<START> i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful br br if you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously br br if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
<START> a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude keep your freddys and your jasons this film is in the same company as the haunting the original lyrical and truthful it stays with you long into the night much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows a smart rent
<START> this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too small part despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable michelle monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for downey's character's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it's portrayed the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so br br fans of the film say that those who disagree simply don't get it i don't think this is so the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured i got it i just didn't like it paddy breathnach's i went down and guy ritchie's snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of film making that director shane black fails to achieve br br i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwriter makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection
<START> the premise of cabin fever starts like it might have something to offer a group of college teens after finals in the fall goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus br br unfortunately the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop cabin fever is little more than college kids looking for sex booze talking non stop about nothing and seeing how many f bombs they can get into 1 40 minutes or however long this mess is br br the kids act and react stupidly to everything around them one of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs so what does she do she keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds the scene is little more than a gross out in another scene rider strong from boy meets world gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says pancakes and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him if you can figure out the reason for why the pancakes kid was included i'd love to know anyway rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek another kid likes to drop f bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels why your guess is as good as mine br br rider strong is the only kid with any recognition in this movie he tries to calm people down in between the yelling and screaming and f y bombs that people are throwing around when the kids aren't yelling they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are even more if that is possible idiotic than the kids the idiot cop with an iq of 60 at best may be one of the worst acting jobs i have ever seen in a movie you talk about people not playing with a full deck this dork doesn't even know how to find the cards lol i was like will you please shut up already he makes the kid actors look like geniuses the only part that i sort of liked was rider's scary story although gory about the deranged bowling alley guy in interviews rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director eli roth but the problem is that mr roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore there are far too many bad things about this movie for mr roth to get any credit i wish i could agree with rider and find something likable about this movie maybe the fall scenery in the beginning actually rider strong just saves this movie from being a 1 hopefully he was compensated for this junk
<START> i sat down to watch a documentary about puerto rico and i ended up watching one about nuyoricans when i go to puerto rico i fail to see the 50 that live in poverty when i do see struggling people they are usually haitians dominicans or cubans that have recently arrived to the island there is no such thing as spanglish either you speak spanish or you don't and from what i heard you don't pedro albizo campos is not mlk to me mlk was a great man campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1 to the rest he as loco as osama bin laden puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools if you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent puerto rico see cuba haiti dominican republic bahamas all of south and central america and mexico its worked wonders for them this documentary is not about puerto rico this documentary was about the nuyoricans and their struggles br br to the person that complaint that not enough of africa was on the show it was suppose to be about puerto rico not africa denzel will make one shortly just for you br br in conclusion to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the us and want to learn how the prime minister runs things this is not a good documentary about puertorican culture tell your kids to pay attention in geography and history class br br update br br bocabonita doc was about nuyoricans she promoted it as if its how we all feel should have been titled yo soy nuyorican lunche can't speak spanish please stop using puerto rico rican boricua or anything else associated with pr with this nuyorican historical lesson god forbid they play this on the island
<START> amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries what a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and what's with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy br br if i had paid more than 7 for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime
<START> i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of indiana jones and the temple of doom unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn not like any yawn i have had before though this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie the cover described amazing special effects there were none the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence good if you want to teach your kids that i don't keep away from this one if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere
<START> i didn't expect much from this but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half it's certainly not a momentous work of comedy but given the low budget indy genesis this is masterful to level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through i look forward to his next effort
