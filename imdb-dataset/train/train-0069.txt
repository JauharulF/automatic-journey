<START> i go to a lot of movies often i bring my 5 year old son i am so glad i did not bring him to this one there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene however that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it the trailers lead you to believe it is a light hearted comedy nevertheless virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews i kept waiting for it to get interesting funny or anything but serious however i nearly fell asleep as the plot less story dragged on i understand that dogs can be great company that being said the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned the worst movie i've ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson a waste of their talent the best way to sum up this movie is couple gets unruly dog couple falls in love with dog dog dies couple sad the end
<START> this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of everybody loves raymond warburton is always hilarious and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines after having raved over the british series coupling i can see from just where the creators of rules of engagement got their original idea but this is not intended as being a brickbat the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series particularly in the very difficult field of comedy having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia i can appreciate particularly the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously canned laughter surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series
<START> i must say as a girl with a cowboy of my own i love this flick it left me lovin them boots and wranglers even more i told my friend about it and she loved it just as much we were 'bout 13 at the time i think it's the greatest love story ever told i own it and never get tired of bud sissy
<START> br br arriving by boxcar in new york city the shrewd young woman with the baby face begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank br br barbara stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre code drama without a shred of decency or regret she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way a wonderful actress stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents br br appearing quite late in the story george brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle stanwyck his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor douglas dumbrille donald cook henry kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims br br john wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for stanwyck's affections this would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen br br movie mavens should recognize nat pendleton as a speakeasy customer and charles sellon edward van sloan as bank executives all unbilled br br the music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film perfectly punctuating the plot is Âbaby face' 1926 by benny davis harry akst and Âst louis blues' 1914 by w c handy br br baby face is a prime example of pre code naughtiness in its frank unapologetic dealing with sex it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the production code in 1934 was meant to eliminate
<START> oh i heard so much good about this movie went to see it with my best friend she's female i'm male now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream after the first couple of dozen take off your clothes we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom we laughed at it not with it we dozed and would have been better off staying in bed we were convinced we had spent money in vain and we had the plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care a waste of money a waste of celluloid this movie doesn't even deserve one out of ten votes but that's the lowest available i'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent i don't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence
<START> this film makes american pie a sophisticated movie no further comment needed humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward every clichÃ© is used several times without any original twist and far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope it's so sad
<START> anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black white movies should put this on their television set when the child walks by wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting's about tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn't big enough to watch it yet that'll hold him there for a few minutes director george stevens and his team will keep him to the end br br i think my father did that to me anyway and i'm the better man for it this classic adventure yarn set in india during the british occupation features a trio of army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart help arrives in the form of a vicious thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against br br gunga din was one of the great movies to come out of hollywood's finest year 1939 even more than most great movies from that golden year it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way the theme music is instant hummable nirvana while shot in california the camera work the only thing in gunga din that got so much as an oscar nomination has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the raj of a hundred years before the battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real not staged like some cecil b demille biblical slaughter fest br br the script doesn't just set up action scenes it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor the main focus is on sgt cutter chasing after tall tales of golden treasures it's a rare actioner for cary grant and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense br br anchoring the trio is sgt macchesney victor mclaglen who dotes over his elephant annie and tries to protect cutter from his own hare brained schemes he's just as funny in his own way leaving sgt ballantine douglas fairbanks jr displaying some nice errol flynnish dash as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up br br if gunga din was a lifetime movie it would be about joan fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks but since it's a guys' film the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save ballantine from a fate worse than death not only marriage but as cutter indignantly exclaims several times the tea business too br br the political correctness police are hard on this film not so much for the gender issue but the idea of british soldiers saving poor indians from the vicious thuggies it reeks of colonial apologia thankfully this film was made back when and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film that these three sergeants so full of derring do and false racial pride have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval after all for all their swashbuckling glory the film's true sacrifice involves the title character played so heart wrenchingly by sam jaffe br br back when this film was made movie mogul jack warner had a saying you want to send a message use western union still it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in gunga din i watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what gunga din was really up to when he led cutter to the golden temple was he really plotting revenge against his british overlords would he have been justified in doing so especially given macchesney's cold treatment of him when col weed delivers that eulogy the poem by rudyard kipling on which the film is loosely based was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly of lording it over someone who proved a better man than i am in the end what did they make of the guru's great speech delivered in perfect clipped english you have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith which is your country england well i can die for my country and my faith as readily as you india farewell br br of course the same character also instructs his brutal followers kill for the love of killing kill for the love of kali kill kill kill which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the british and save the questions about what it all means for later br br what gunga din means to me most of all is the quickest surest 90 minute thrill ride on video cutter never found his golden temple but there's one for all of us watching gunga din
<START> when i saw this animation for first time i was 15 maybe i was really impressed it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark the colors are not that colorous the characters don't talk much there are no long and boring conversations of this and that like in ghost in the shell with its dark pictures views of strange beasts and sense of magic it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian stories full of violence and horrendous creators enchanted forests and deep caves dwelled by dragons throlls orks and one mysterious hero to stop evil
<START> born again the limerick br br if a man could come back from the dead br br and live in a little girl's head br br revenge he would get br br for the murder he met br br by the guy that's now in his wife's bed br br for me born again is a highly under rated classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x files for me before i started watching it i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night you'd think her parents would have been worried and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story and was was with the telekinesis other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it but even with its little flaws in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it 10 out of 10
<START> one of the best documentaries released in recent years some points br br 1 hugo chavez was elected venezuela's president in 1998 his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela br br 2 in 2002 a coup briefly deposed chavez at the time irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were in caracas shooting a documentary about chavez for british television their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath and electrifyingly records history unfolding on the spot outside and inside the presidential palace br br 3 chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free market policies imposed on it by the us though venezuela's oil was already state owned it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace br br 4 despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier venezuela remains swamped by poverty its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations br br 5 the documentary begins by portraying chavez's first years as president before the coup it focuses on his popularity with the poor and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals educational plans distribution of the oil revenue grass root democracy etc br br 6 chavez was a huge proponent of education and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution encouraging children and adults to study and understand it br br 7 when chavez came to power he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits this understandably made the oil companies nervous br br 8 a media war broke out the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state run tv station they questioned chavez's motives sanity and sexual orientation br br 9 without media support the coup would not have been successful the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated br br 10 under the guise of re establishing democracy the opposition silenced the state run tv station dissolved the national electoral board supreme court national assembly and took control of the military br br 11 moneyed interests backed by the military elite encouraged by the us and cia organised a citizens' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup snipers shot at chÃ¡vez supporters but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted br br 12 police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters further bloodying the streets br br 13 chavez held captive refused to resign of course the media government then lied saying he had resigned but chavez's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv br br 14 the people rose up pressuring the return of the president they had elected whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace br br 8 9 10 at a little over an hour long this doc is far too short nevertheless its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of media warfare which rarely gets touched upon makes a great companion piece to the battle of algiers br br worth one viewing
<START> as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies most if them i never understand i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood last week i watched a film called the polish wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse none of the actors can act absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom the plot is so silly nobody can believe it i think the whole thing is a mess from the start lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter ahmed sellam
<START> it feels like swedish movies are trying to become more american and i just donÂ´t get it in this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special donÂ´t waste your time

<START> kolchak was a tv series that really didn't fit into any category part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that i think people weren't ready for it's a shame really as i've started to watch these shows on the chiller network i never saw the originals i realized how different and interesting it really was br br starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service and simon oakland as his always angry boss tony vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart a somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him his jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor oakland are downright hilarious br br the stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good the 70's were not a great period for special effects and the show suffers for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it's time

<START> i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed everything about it was superb the acting the characters the story a believable child who grew into brave always willing to help others his mum must be proud i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something it is the prefect fable tale with morals cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour alongside a red man dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores the lines are good especially the don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad and not necessarily so cheers furdion
<START> here's yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists this slow picturesque the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of costner's recent open range which also starred robert duval and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a listless sunday afternoon those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced glenn close robert duval and wilford brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors i especially liked how director cain who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first young guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone's personal grief we don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenager's girlfriend what we essentially get here is the rural mid western answer to ordinary people there's also shades of david lynch's the straight story in some of the stoic downhome mid west morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit this is one of the better and more realistic tear jerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there
<START> a new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor james stewart teamed with the equally brilliant director anthony mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future until that time stewart was mainly noted for an aw aw aw approach to family oriented comedies dramas and romances not that he wasn't already a multi talented hollywood star one of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as macaulay 'mike' connor a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in the philadelphia story he had even done westerns before his portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot thomas jefferson destry jr in the comedy western destry rides again helped make that film a classic but to most movie goers he was the all american boyscout type mr smith or george bailey seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played br br anthony mann was associated with b flicks in the film noir mode raw deal side street and t men caught the eye of james stewart so the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest hollywood westerns ever made winchester '73 and the man from laramie were the best but the others were almost as effective mann became a successful director of a films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all gary cooper's man of the west stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on br br winchester '73 was also one of the first films maybe the first to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie which also holds a surprise for the viewer based on a story by stuart lake the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the winchester '73 the year is 1876 custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the sioux and cheyenne at little big horn the whites want revenge the native americans want their land and their way of life back this conflict leads to a confrontation between native americas led by young bull young rock hudson showing his potential as an actor and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians lin mcadam stewart his partner and life long pal high spade the underrated actor millard mitchell and a couple trying to find themselves steve miller charles drake and lola manners shelley winters a soiled dove with a kind heart among the horse soldiers are newcomers tony curtis and james best late of the dukes of hazzard whose part is cut short by a bullet br br wyatt earp was in dodge city in 1876 the movie has him as head marshal the fine actor will geer later of the waltons looks like an older earp in reality wyatt was assistant marshal in dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman lin mcadam wins the winchester in a shooting contest but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw dutch henry brown stephen mcnally and his henchmen mcadam and high spade are after both dutch henry and the winchester for the remainder of the movie an even more sinister character emerges along the way waco johnnie dean played as evil personified by dan duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast br br the winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film each time the transfer is intense one involves a gunrunner played to perfection by john mcintire other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above all this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show br br as noted above the cast is first rate down to the smallest role look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts including the future sheriff of bonanza ray teal and b western reliable panhandle perkins guy wilkerson
<START> saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal what a disappointment this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans the acting was only but regular the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting the plot lacks considerably the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls 7eventy 5ive and on top of that you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie you might like it if you don't this movie is not worth it
<START> the master of cheap erotic horror rolfe kanefsky finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the playboy channel the hazing borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on elm street to evil dead but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely the characters are cardboard the dialogue is wooden the story is paper thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie sometimes when i'm bored i like to eat paper watching this movie is a lot like that chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value
