<START> to confess having fantasies about brad pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make but what can i tell you maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star it crosses that barrier it pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory brando had it in spades montgomery clift gary cooper james dean of course and in more recent times tom cruise jude law johnny depp ewan mcgregor and billy crudup women fell in love with garbo dietrich katharine and audrey hepburn grace kelly marilyn monroe julie christie charlotte rampling meryl streep vanessa redgrave julia roberts and very very recently natalie portman but brad pitt has singlehandedly redefined the concept he is the only reason to go out get in the car find parking buy a ticket popcorn and get into a theatre to see troy if you liked epics in the jupiter's darling style you may enjoy this but if you don't go all the same we want to keep brad pitt in business
<START> this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyote br br many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4 scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schriber's performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye candy wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the film br br the final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character br br very disappointing
<START> oh my god this was so bad the story was weak at best and the animation was flat and lifeless even childish this film takes itself far too seriously unless of course they meant to be funny i saw this last week at the london sci fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene i think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at oopsalof' and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalo's only line 'we will be together it is our destiny ' i'm sorry but after the first time the words lost all meaning br br and what was with the apple br br i recommend this as a lesson to americans you cannot animate so please don't try you only embarrass yourselves
<START> writer director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called somewhat unfairly hitchcock imitations contrary to popular belief de palma doesn't rip off hitchcock he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent modern way like hitchcock de palma is known for mixing blood soaked death with macabre humor br br dressed to kill made way back in 1980 is perhaps de palma's most well known hitchcockian film and it's probably his best as well the story involves a cross dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt out housewife played by angie dickinson and a street wise hooker played by nancy allen br br yes it will remind you distinctly of psycho but de palma's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative the museum sequence is particularly well scored and edited the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film dressed to kill may not be a complete original but i'd say it's definitely worth your time rated r 105 minutes 9 out of 10
<START> why did i waste my time with this movie there was not a single funny joke or line throughout the slapstick wasn't even mildly funny i mean really an out of control vacuum sucking pipe why has the national lampoon's name been attached to this movie even christmas vacation was better than this i actually thought that film was very funny br br avoid like the plague
<START> i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise's weird movies magnolia eyes wide shut but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie many people said it was weird it wasn't it was different and confusing but not weird weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore different is the truman show confusing is the matrix or the game and unlike kubrick this movie has a conclusion everything makes sense maybe not immediately maybe not even today but it will make sense vanilla sky is confusing because david aames tom cruise is confused that's the point that's where the so called weirdness that turned critics away came in if they had bothered to open their eyes as the original 1997 spanish movie they would have seen that and if that's not enough reason to see it go see it for the music cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack he uses it to set the feel that notorious element that many movies lack with songs like the beach boys' good vibrations playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie he creates an offbeat yet astoundingly right feel a wonderful film in its script music acting and images vanilla sky is sadly a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent excellent a
<START> i loved this movie the scenery was breathtaking the plot had some nice twists and turns and the characters were well rounded on two fronts however rob roy scored far above average first i have rarely seen a popular film in which the quality of dialogue was so high there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay i could give numerous examples but why should i just watch the film second this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more for a drama to succeed it needs not only a hero but a really believable villain if you don't have one there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys and rob roy has not one but three the earl of montrose his henchman kilairn and archie not one dimensional villains either but fully fleshed and very nasty it takes a bit more patience than braveheart there's more dialogue and the accents are a bit tough but it's a much more clever and subtle piece as i said i loved this movie
<START> i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like citizen kane and seven samaurai however this movie is so all around wonderful it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter however the imdb voter leans to the geeky and paulie doesn't qualify for that br br the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child i'm sorry but asking a 6 year old child to out do dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in film making br br moving past that minor complaint the movie has the best of many films buddy road trip con games hero as friendly party animal party bird disney like humor for young and old etc what's not to like tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans that's normal for him it seems i'm russian i like long stories i don't like mangoes but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one watch the movie and that will make sense br br buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy and his on screen role fits that as well the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulie's voice in the end even that works well put parrot and anti parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own br br if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either paulie is a perfect candidate i will however admit that a happy moment colors my review of paulie i was on a road trip during a major heat wave the car's air conditioning died half the restaurants had dead cooling as did our hotel and i said let's watch a movie where there is working air conditioning so we did so for 100 minutes we were cooled amused and given a heart warming experience when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances i realized just how well this movie was made br br it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching
<START> ah the best and funniest movie about female football fans only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in north london qv by the way i just watched this on film 4 2008 12 21 and am ruing my inability to set the pvr br br this is easily my second favourite football movie after mike bassett england manager but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of movie making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun is setting fast reactions all round br br it is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the lavvies while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of ali daei i couldn't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's calls for assistance br br speaking of the toilets i just wish i could speak farsi so that i could work out the writing on the toilet walls yes there were a few scribblings in roman script but they mostly referred to wanky american rock bands br br also on the rural and farsi theme don't you reckon that omid djalili sounds like a yokel when he talks farsi listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go yup br br i'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of iran and i'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing top notch stuff br br here's a list of my top favourite football movies 1 mike bassett england manager 2 offside 3 those glory glory days 4 a shot at glory 5 the arsenal stadium mystery
<START> wow ok so after reading the little feud on here i decided i had to see this movie for myself this movie is horrible i stopped watching it i strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie you'll be more spooked entertained br br it's low budget with bad acting br br whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded br br i am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers br br simply put this movie is not worth watching br br very very bad movie
<START> wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood br br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs 45 secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then br br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes br br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money
<START> this movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be one must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously it's camp along the same lines as army of darkness aod was silly but funny and bad in a good way house of the dead fails to be good bad br br there are qualities inherent in good campy movies most important of those being believable fantasy one needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong without boundaries the movie becomes absurd hotd lacks any believability br br worse still hotd brings nothing new to the genre and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit for example all too often horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction i don't know about you but when i'm being chased by zombies i wanna make out with a hot chick believe it no then you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie br br beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies uwe boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot further there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities avoid
<START> i guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first superman film as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original br br after an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals the credits pay homage to the even crummy looking for their time futuristic sweeping credits of the original superman film br br then there is some more murky stuff ma kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield then superman sneaks up on her and faints br br next we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close ups of an old lady as she dies we don't see luthor's face until the end of the scene an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned lex luthor is a guy who doesn't like superman because he is not human also he probably doesn't like humans either as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about lex luthor planning to kill most of earth's population br br after a while clark kent shows up back at his old job i forgot to mention he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened then he finds out lois lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating cyclops it upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame br br at this point we see that miss lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle it is some kind of important event on account of it is on television then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event there are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit the film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer br br as the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build i excused myself to get a soda i accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about al gore showing slides in its entirety i tried to find my way back to superman returns but i somehow wandered into prairie home companion which i watched twice in a row then it was time to stop messing around br br i walked back into the first theater found my seat and looked up to see that the impending lois lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us still it seemed to be taking forever so i wandered around the theater met a girl got married raised a son and sent him off to college while attending my son's medical school graduation i remembered that i should probably check in on superman returns so i excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane when they did superman saved everybody which was pretty cool br br and then there is a a subplot where superman turns really creepy and starts stalking lois lane and her family with his x ray vision and super hearing then he tries to get her to cheat on cyclops who seems like a good guy br br meanwhile lex luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie i forgot to bring my scorecard home with me they give you one at the door but i think he scored damn close to one hundred percent i hope he wins the million dollars br br at this point things start to gear up for the big murky finale i think maybe the projector was broken on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here i remember seeing murky things growing out of the water superman getting sick superman getting better back to the murky things he's sick again no wait he's okay again br br then lex luthor unleashed his final bad guy move yelling at his girlfriend a little bit br br then superman died and came back to life i thought the movie was over so i left br br ninety years later the nursing home where i lived felt a little chilly i realized i left my sweatshirt back in the theater and i went to retrieve it when i did i was slightly surprised to find that superman returns wasn't over yet i tried to ask some of the viewers what i missed but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now br br i sat back in my old seat and watched as lois lane puttered around her house for a while then superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie and since i already saw that part i thought it was okay to leave br br so that is my review of superman returns br br oh also if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog you will love this movie on account of there are two jokes like that in it
<START> the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost br br i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed it br br from the get go bbs felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection br br if you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can bbs delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it
<START> given the title and outlandish box art i was ready for just about anything perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high because i was left a little dry br br a film crew working on a soft core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex where hasn't this set up been used before the difference here is the uber perverse nature of the sex not allowed to show all the goods groin shots were illegal in japan for a long time what is shown is fogged out the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be br br amidst all the kinky goings on a mud monster whose origin i can't fathom shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women then murdering them too some of the sights are a bit much most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of stuff but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare br br ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs it's too over sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick the mediums can work but there need to be a balance br br 4 10
<START> this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny entertaining and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right i recommend this movie to anyone of any age
<START> dig is funny fun amusing interesting stylish and very well done knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told especially with such style and substance if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see br br focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs alcohol and insanity if i did not know that this is footage of real people i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece the story is compelling concise and simply amazing
<START> this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders who it shows between 1969 and 1971 were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments anglo american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post colonial states were moving away from the western orbit it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation and in these new circumstances beset by homesickness they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death br br following the passage of more than three decades however in recent months and years following the release of many utterly damning papers from britain's public record office one rather suspects that there was some mistake and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state as such the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved nevertheless the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime
<START> let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non asian actors playing asian roles the movie is 67 years old in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could should be able to play any role actors were under contracts and did not always have a choice about what role they played end of story br br this is a truly great epic story of love individual rights class strata and men women issues the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni br br muni plays wang a chinese farmer who is about to take a wife rainer from the start he treats her with respect during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help without giving too much of the movie away they go through the highs and lows of all relationships and even though the story may take place in late 19th early 20th century the story and much of their feelings seems credible br br other than the fact that the movie is about 5 10 minutes longer than it needs to be and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters this is a really wonderful movie that unfortunately has become a victim of political correctness br br 9 out of 10
<START> sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother frank well roll out those awards now mullet haired muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays calls for him doing the role as an american italian wise guy refugee from the 'godfather ' please somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse ' this film just stinks the place out even by the terrible overacting in this frank still steals the acting dishonours all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films br br the plot what there is makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat what happens in the end i'm not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished br br avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth br br n b point of order when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear she has her knickers panties under her suspenders garter belt it's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss a trivial point perhaps but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this right
