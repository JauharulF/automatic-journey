<START> brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler forget this
<START> this was a gem amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham orla brady and all the supporting cast the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family the title love divided couldn't capture it any better even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and pogroms are starting reminded me of russian history the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature just like in the movie the liam cunningham's character says the hatred had always been there under the surface it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful the story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better stronger liam cunningham's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be again acting is a top notch story is fast paced irish countryside is as beautiful as ever highly recommended
<START> i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x men the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are 1 turning point 2 spider wars 3 the hobgoblin 4 the alien costume 5 mutant agenda br br but there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i don't like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don't like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season 2 of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i don't like spidey as the man spider br br but i guess everything than this was bad
<START> ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minutes into the movie we'd exchanged a lot of ehhh what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we opted for the latter br br i liked but i'm a cheerleader a lot but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer d e b s better than chocolate fucking ÃmÃ¥l goldfish memory and fire br br sorcia
<START> i loved this film i first saw it when i was 20 which was only four years ago and i enjoyed it so much i brought my own copy the next day the comedy is well played by all involved i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area also look for jason robards father who plays mr retch talent ran in that family
<START> i am right now in front of the tv watching casomai it is changing it id evolving or better devolving it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love story is reported after that everything change a child was born and all the rest usually happen in a couple it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and normality is the center of this movie it doesn't want to show us something particular there is nothing new it is just a normal love story the story of a couple and being normal it become different from the rest it is also a flashing movie everything is short every scene is long just some seconds it is a reported story many things are known because friends and parents talk about that and their opinion is central the opinions create the story and destroy it it is a simple story of a couple as i said but it is not boring it just show a couple should be everything known it is but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen so don't forget to watch the end
<START> br br charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular but this canadian gem makes it hilarious br br like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let's set the scene two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood they can't cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to but that is where even more problems begin br br i loved this film it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of nothing out there br br don't miss this br br
<START> frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors br br the opposite of perdition being lost is salvation being saved and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father son relationship it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes br br the premise is that the fathers in the move hit man michael sullivan tom hanks and his crime boss john rooney paul newman love their sons and will do anything to protect them but rooney's son connor is even more evil than the rest he kills one of rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father when connor learns that sullivan's son michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills sullivan's other son and sullivan's wife in an attempt to silence witnesses br br sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition rooney who in one scene curses the day connor was born refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan and hires a contract killer named maguire jude law to kill sullivan and his son so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perdition br br for the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young michael sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition and maguire pursues sullivan when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family rooney says michael there are only murderers in this room and there's only one guarantee none of us will see heaven as the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repents br br i'm not a big tom hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hit man sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by connor's misdeeds jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectation br br the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois the greens belonged to the younger sons and that state's rural flatlands thomas newman's lush sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in copland like arrangements the sets were authentic mid western urban factories churches the homes shone with gleaming woodwork br br the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography the only negative was a slight anti gun message slipped into the screenplay y the movie's only nod to political correctness br br i give this movie a10 out of 10 in time it will be acknowledged as a great film
<START> this film plays really well with an audience especially once the chase begins plus trevor howard with his sensible smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together br br the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household plus it helps bring out the real killer who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away and it is true that her lack of control in the household as well as evidence pointing her way there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth br br this is an entertaining film seek it out if you can find it
<START> tom hanks has been in such hit movies as forrest gump saving private ryan and the green mile for the most part his roles have been good guys that we cheer for in road to perdition his character michael sullivanis a little bit different br br in sam mendes' film road to perdition based on the graphic novel by max allan collins he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the great depression in chicago what is different about this little road trip is that sullivan is a hit man who is now being hunted by his former partner his boss or ex boss john rooney paul newman loves him almost more than his own son sullivan's partner connor daniel craig br br after a job done the wrong way because of connor the only witness to his mistake are sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there so connor tries to take out sullivan and his family but only gets the wife and other son peter sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find michael jr sitting at the table just sitting with his wife and child dead sullivan takes to the road to find answers br br the story follows the two as sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid and for michael who feels like he is to blame for all this he feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother tyler hoechlin does a terrific job as michael jr he brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile his loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town leaving nothing behind him br br mendes' previous hit film was american beauty which received five oscars including best picture and best director this film didn't do nearly as well at the oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music sound and a best actor in a supporting role for paul newman this picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the midwest and into the legend of mike sullivan husband hit man and devoted father this movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come
<START> hey guys br br i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area i am australian could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages it was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager it is a great movie for the whole family my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on dvd br br sally
<START> good show br br the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys there is moral decadence in a virtual world there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention i predict based on the bsg background that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery in addition to this there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves br br this show is not bsg at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making there are not a lot of shoot em up or space based special effects either at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far br br what it does have are very good stories characters and themes it also has good performances from the actors they can make a culture which is similar to modern day society but alien at the same time be completely believable like bsg this show is about humanity our strengths weaknesses potential and flaws it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties antique cars and chicken but those things are really more to create a semi familiar background than anything else anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point whether you are from a mafia style culture or an affluent and high tech culture humans and human nature aren't that different 150 000 years ago in a high tech past than what we see in the world today wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something
<START> a really cool flick a must for any music snob you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie before the movie i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols the only thing is required is an open mind br br the movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre the dandy warhols have a role in the film as the 'rival band ' but they are second fiddle to the bjm the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed but then again they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the bjm you can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man anton newcombe by itself it's an insightful film and study on the music industry just watch this film and enjoy
<START> this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call 'artistic' it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i've heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don't think that's true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren't particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i'd say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10
<START> not that a film by ulli lommel filled me with hope but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid the effect is never perfect but it helps unfiltered digital video really only works for the mockumentary style because it never looks like anything other than video therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer it does not feel like watching a movie and what's even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker he ought to know better he ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror or even suspense on video for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business and lucky us he wrote the script too so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing unjustified behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied please please miss this film you'll thank me later
<START> this is the best and most original show seen in years the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it the cast is excellent the writing is great i personally like every character however there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life i believe abc has done a disservice to the writers actors and to the potential audience of this show to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following there are so few shows i watch anymore as most tv is awful this show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites greys anatomy and brothers and sisters in fact i think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they even knew about it why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away i am so sick of reality shows i do not watch any of them it was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors this show had so much promise the recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real please watch this show on abc's video and let abc know you wish to have this show back please sign the online petition to abc http www petitiononline com gh1215 petition html
<START> warner bros made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced economical and very entertaining i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life this is one of warner's few hard edged melodramas that simply doesn't work edward g robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20 year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard h b warner aline macmahon and boris karloff are good but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie in addition the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre code hollywood leroy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations sol polito's camera work is strong somehow this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture in a year that gave us m dracula and frankenstein
<START> you have to figure that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads cuba gooding j r some nice car chase shoot 'em up blow 'em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of gooding's at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he can't have something on all of them can he
<START> kids like these could have been a decent film given the subject matter but instead it has become a below average run of the mill tv movie of the week with not much going for it the acting is stale the plot predictable and the direction non existent for a better movie on the same subject try the excellent le huitiÃ¨me jour a film that really cares about the people with down syndrome in kids like these they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality pretty appalling 1 10
<START> weak plot unlikely car malfunction and helpless fumbling characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as 97 i was astonished this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies i have ever seen br br if you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry
