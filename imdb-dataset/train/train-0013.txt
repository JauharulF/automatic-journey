<START> i imagine that the young people involved in the making of necromancy aka the witching plus a bunch of other titles must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who participated with john houseman in the production of a proletarian play the cradle will rock scared people into thinking that aliens were invading the war of the worlds and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time citizen kane and now orson welles was starring in a third rate flick about a satanic cult br br there's basically nothing creative about this movie lots of nudity but the background music always proves really distracting even if the movie wasn't particularly predictable it still wasn't worth seeing how low welles had sunk fortunately over the final thirteen years of his life he narrated the documentary bugs bunny superstar about the warner bros cartoons of the 1940s and hosted the documentary the man who saw tomorrow about nostradamus i recommend those two but not this one just avoid it br br also starring pamela franklin and michael ontkean
<START> it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside as did happen to some rin tin tin however was pertfectly natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john barrymore's soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving by and large only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition
<START> i've just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive s'more entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb br br mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you're in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it
<START> near the beginning after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger warren oates is an egomaniacal rapist another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi second in command melvin purvis ben johnson surveys the situations sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth picks up two loaded 45 caliber automatics and stalks off into the distant house alone bang bang bang purvis emerges alone from the house carrying the female hostage the miscreant dead all in long shot br br if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood this should have considerable appeal br br oh it's as exciting as it is mindless pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically multiple violations of the civic code plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols blood all over br br as history it stinks few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero partly i would guess because of his name melvin purvis we all remember j edgar hoover who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though br br the picture was written and directed by john milius he's the guy who had it written into his contract that should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions he should be the designated shooter milius is the guy a compleat gun freak who had teddy roosevelt's rough riders in the spanish american war shouting quotations from henry v saint crispin's day and all that br br exciting yes and complete garbage i knew i'd never take him alive and i didn't try too hard neither that is kill 'em all and let god sort them out br br you'll just love it
<START> this movie which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver less moving vehicle has quite the quirky little personality to boot the cast of seven although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is are all super hot as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert an odd but effective choice of setting who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck it predates many of the vehicle inspired slashers to date the trip joy ride jeepers creepers where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist the killer himself is quite creepy and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire as scanty and stonewashed as it may be director bill crain does some really great things with his camera some neat tricks on screen and the cast tries their absolute best there's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans and enough t a from a couple of the girls to please t a fans overall this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video highly recommended
<START> yes as unbelievable as it may be in 1968 a musical won the academy award for best picture and it was the third musical to win that award in a five year period the first being my fair lady in 1964 and then the sound of music in 1965 the difference between my fair lady the sound of music and oliver however is that oliver is immeasurably better no comparison the first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust oliver the acting is great the songs are great the story is great and the dancing is great this movie is dynamic topical relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york oliver offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century london england that evokes sympathy without being condescending oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver the other actors and actresses especially ron moody and shani wallis are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures
<START> there's no getting around it this movie is terrible i've seen the old christopher lee fu manchu movies i'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origins but it's still just godawful however peter sellers' genius still shines through with his portrayal of nayland smith with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength simmering through a stoic facade it's a performance i place on par with peter cushing's portrayal of van helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all cushing's dracula movies if the movie was done in a more serio comic vein like bubba ho tep by way of the 1960's avengers tv show this could've been something special if you're a fu manchu or peter sellers completest this is something you need to see but it's a pass for anyone else
<START> i remembered this show from when i was a kid i couldn't remember too much about it just a few minor things about the characters for some reason i remembered it being really intense also it was on really really early in the morning up in pa i finally after looking around the web for a long time found an episode the first episode no less criminey this show was so horrible it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy my names not christopher i'm bhodi li photon warrior we then are forced to watch kids playing lazer tag to the song foot loose and not just a quick little bit but the whole song ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it oh yeah and as if i couldn't get worse you cant even see the laser beams from their guns its like they're just running around to the entire foot loose song later on after bhodi goes up into space or where ever they have a crappy laser gun fight to the phil collins song su su sudio ah trust me you don't want to know the rest what can i say the light shines
<START> i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary br br what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew i think this made the film more japanese which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan to america horror movie flops but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character a frightened fish in a big busy unfamiliar tokyo pond br br the storyline was quite confusing as well in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until at the end of the film we see the ending and beginning of the whole story this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me also i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me she had already seen it as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story br br overall there is plenty for american audiences to love tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes
<START> the documentary presents an original theory about guns germs and steel the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticism br br i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis br br so if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation
<START> the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title but a swear word in it br br this film was funny as hell it was also true to the bone if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it you will understand the humor if not you may not 'get it' at all br br the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point it is a rare gem it states it is a drama but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedy br br loren dean is wonderful as always as a supporting actor jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene the only downside was carmen electra but we can't have everything
<START> this outstanding argentine independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all south america including argentina which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999 in 2000 alone argentina released many quality films which broke argentine b o records a half dozen were internationally acclaimed like this one at important world film festivals after viewing this film one can see how home grown argentinian films were able last year to recapture 20 of its national movie market br br directed by one of argentina's best directors daniel burman this film examines effects of globalisation worldwide but emphasizes its impact on argentina and particularly the jewish community of buenos aires daniel hendler is wonderful as the nice jewish boy trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate hector alterio one of the great actors of hispanic cinema worldwide is perfect as simon the jewish father as is the rest of the cast which includes spanish and italian stars br br so many current themes in urban western societies are explored i don't have enough space to go into detail daniel burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters personifying diverse dilemmas if this film plays at a festival near you or on video don't miss it
<START> wow what a movie i'm not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors usually i don't like dramas i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor but this movie it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting wow it is stunning this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like the pursuit of happiness maybe also because i did not like the acting of will's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors i saw him also last night in the day the earth stood still and i confirmed my sensation that jaden can't act i don't want to write spoilers and so i don't talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love death and other feelings which i don't like to watch in movies but this movie is such a super great movie if you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it
<START> yes talk about bad sequels rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once funny and entertaining honey i shrunk the kids the concept basically plays the same way as the first film but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore if you think this sounds interesting think again the movie is boring at best right down an embarrassment at worst br br first of all the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis the actress playing his wife has changed the actors playing the kids have changed the ones playing the neighbors have changed you name it they try to make us believe this is the same family but the results are puzzling to say the least br br second the story is a rehash of the first one with not one bit of originality all the few jokes and there's barely any and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from honey i shrunk the kids br br third problem the special effects i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget but they are pathetic way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time br br fourth problem to locate the action inside the house is just boring only few things happen and when they happen they are not thrilling at all the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature the grass and the bugs that live in it in this one the adults which come up as rather boring compared to the kids deal with dust a cockroach and a cockroach trap disgusting br br i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new i'm warning you leave this tasteless cash in garbage where it should stay getting dust on the shop's shelves
<START> to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel made this story all the more compelling you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life susan hayward's fear reluctance but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her one could also feel david's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle raymond massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind i gave it a rating of ten
<START> i grew up watching this movie and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid don't listen to the critic reviews they are not accurate on this film eddie murphy really shines in his roll you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it i recommend this movie to everybody to see it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy with demons dragons and a little bald kid with god like powers this movie takes you from l a to tibet of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet just a beautiful view so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up you wont regret it
<START> no wonder that the historian ian kershaw author of the groundbreaking hitler biography who originally was the scientific consultant for this tv film dissociated himself from it the film is historically just too incorrect the mistakes start right away when hitler s father alois dies at home while in reality he died in a pub in the film hitler moves from vienna to munich in 1914 while in reality he actually moved to munich in 1913 i could go on endlessly hitler s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man important persons of the early time of the party like hitler s fatherly friend dietrich eckart or the party philosopher alfred rosenberg are totally missing the characterization of ernst hanfstaengl is very problematic in the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises hitler the script obviously follows hanfstaengl s own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war in fact hanfstaengl was an anti semite and was crazy about his fuehrer but the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of hitler himself he is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around after watching the film one wonders how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers since we all know what an evil criminal hitler was naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic but facts is that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining his comrades didn t follow him because he constantly yelled at them but because they liked this strange man beyond all those historical mistakes the film is well made the actors are first class the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era
<START> bette davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film the film seems rather dated now in 2003 it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today it was startling for me to see how young ms davis looks in this move the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting leslie howard is well cast as philip carey the club footed medical student this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why however of human bondage didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it i have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for you be the judge br br
<START> indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories they are either the honest type or the bad guys the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end br br this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema goes br br the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times but i would still give this one 9 10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit
<START> this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector clouseau in his stoicism and chauncey gardiner in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all br br he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood he's 28 and admits he's never had sex br br very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen where the two software people travel on business they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail my theory is that they're trying the wrong places they go to more or less 'youth' nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own age br br harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort as in taxi driver urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub br br worth watching
