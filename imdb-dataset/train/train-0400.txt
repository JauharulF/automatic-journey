<START> almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible it carries no semblance of a genuine human story dead and dull it is a parody of hollywood with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a denzel washington movie wobbly camera shots and focusing racist stereotypes absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses it is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names the only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it i feel like an idiot for watching this save yourself
<START> i must admit at first i wasn't expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt's and hyde's image but i'm glad to say it has much more to offer br br yes the acting is not that great but it doesn't suck either all the cast's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough br br what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst br br it fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone
<START> she's not michael jordan br br think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth their names might trip as easily off the public's lips as russell cousy byrd magic mchale oscar wilt the list goes on but the volume gets turned down a little for stockton and malone charles patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael br br i've seen it written that gretchen mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms mol it was later said that she had been over hyped i disagree br br i still remember that for some time after i saw the devil's advocate in '97 or '98 i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax was it mol or theron oh yeah charlize theron was the one in 2 days in the valley and mighty joe young and gretchen mol was in donnie brasco celebrity and rounders br br by the time i had seen the thirteenth floor mol and sweet november theron i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer both were highly talented had sweet faces similar body types short blonde hair and so on br br theron though was offered more work i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating br br in 2003 monster was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself all of filmdom knew who the best actress award was going to and deservedly so theron was aileen wuornos the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby's head and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive unheard of br br then in 2005 the notorious bettie page was released mol's performance was extraordinary maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms theron it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate nobody came and nobody cared it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a b movie ho hum no no no wrong no matter what you may think of the film and i enjoy films about the fifties if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year ms moll was every bit as much bettie as ms theron was aileen unfortunately aileen to the film going public is the more sympathetic character for whatever reason an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a naÃ¯ve unsophisticated uninhibited religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties her photos and films never sexual never pornographic but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky there was no sense of realism only parody ms moll captured the very essence of the character she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film her body was bettie's her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality in this film it's all about innocence seeing gretchen bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other if you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years by the way shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating
<START> rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost although only 15 minutes long griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ruth's pet cow tulip the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived
<START> dwight frye steals the show in this one as a foolish young man who seems to be mentally handicapped who gets himself blamed for vampire like murders especially after he reveals his love for bats which he likes to stroke and give to unsuspecting friends as 'gifts' besides all of that there's an entertaining mystery tale involving the above mentioned murders underrated
<START> mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers that be disowned this waste of celluloid the editing is el crapo the plot is incredibly thin and stupid and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot i never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing but i do and i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of film at least mr leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie and he comes out ahead there are actually copies of this thing with mad's beginning sequence still on it if you can locate one grab it cuz it is probably worth something it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything and a note to the folks at imdb com there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone the makers spoiled it by themselves
<START> artemisia gentileschi the daughter of orazio gentileschi showed an early promise as a painter taught by her father artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men her tragic life is chronicled in this biographic film directed and co written by agnes merlik br br having read the novel the passion of artemisia by susan vreeland made us investigate more into the life of this woman her work and her legacy we also read mary garrard's artemisia gentileschi which should be a must read book by all art lovers br br artemisia presents the fictionalized facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman as she starts to paint she was clearly influenced by the work of her father by caravaggio agostino tassi and other florentine painters of that period her relationship and love affair with tassi is the basis of the film artemisia unfortunately couldn't go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts it didn't help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by tassi she had to go to rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life br br valentina cervi makes a beautiful artemisia she is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men michel serrault plays orazio her father miki maojlovic is seen as tassi the man who wanted artemisia but ended up in jail emmanuelle devos appears for a moment br br the film has a glossy finish that the camera work of benoit delhomme captures in all its splendor the scenic locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their canvases the music by krishna levy serves well what we see agnes merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own
<START> this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family each family has a gay son the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members not just the two sons the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak
<START> this was probably the worst movie ever seriously i could actually do better myself it wasn't even set up properly it's like this movie had a 5 budget and left with change don't watch it i didn't even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off i've give this a 1 10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a headlight and the owner of that car went after them the bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off what the hell it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well
<START> the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it how can so many people have little respect for other people i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone
<START> what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together it's simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a half developed thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film jerkers like to make not too much ambition right sur mes lÃ¨vres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization br br for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before jacques audiard is not a new comer yet strange and weird
<START> this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time miriam flynn is excellent as bunny packard zane buzby as delores is comic genius the rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really really funny a definite satire of horror films with a zany twist if you enjoy a fun comedy filled evening then go and rent this classic you'll laugh all the way through
<START> the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does
<START> an interesting tv movie based on true fact betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters that of a prisoner giovanni ribisi plays his younger brother who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty but when he goes to visit him and enters elias koteas the problem starts it has nothing to do with koteas' acting ability he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to g q magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend whom i had not seen for almost 15 years which he spent in several panamanian jails the young man i used to know is gone not only because he is older but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system there are jails and there are jails one must say but this one prisoner in shot in the heart is definitely out of this world
<START> this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind tibetan children trekking in the himalayas but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people on one hand there is erik weihenmeyer the first blind man to climb everest and the team of sighted mountaineers who are guiding the kids on the other there is sabriye tenberken a blind woman who runs the first school for blind tibetans who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing at some level sabine simply doesn't understand the mountaineer's philosophy with it's emphasis on summitting she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with especially as she has an effective veto in the background to this reasonably well mannered clash we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves i enjoyed the film although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting even though it details the quarrel the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are but it's hard to argue with that assessment even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly
<START> this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn't stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that i've seen all the episodes previously i've always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time i can't say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just don't get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark she's exactly the opposite just google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights etc if you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you don't get it and if you don't get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity
<START> i'm stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did it's an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clichÃ©' of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching this and before we saw the rating we said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences it's possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone it's miles ahead of this schlock
<START> two years ago at sundance i loved josh kornbluth's directing debut haiku tunnel so i was looking forward to his brother and frequent collaborator jacob's the best thief in the world this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower class area of new york the movie is not without its poignant moments but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious life can be very difficult for some people and life isn't fair br br more subtle and more important is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti social behavior they may spawn these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity we can recoil at their language and their living conditions but we are cannot discount their intent and in fact their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is evident throughout br br having said all this the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws including the title the characters aren't very believable the writing is uneven and the plot line is barely discernible and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes to each his own but while i don't question the potential realism of this phenomenon it pains me to see 5 year old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line up of women it's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest
<START> with an absolutely amazing cast and crew this might have been a classic instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the jfk assassination grafted rather pointlessly on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in 1960 many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do sterling hayden or eli wallach for instance or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top john huston jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well in their very different ways though br br the photography is gorgeous but does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of the dvd purchase
<START> very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world oscar material trey parker and matt stone are hilarious and before you see this i suggest you see south park one of the funniest cartoons created buy it you will laugh every time you see it pure stroke of genius if you don't think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor 10 out of 10
