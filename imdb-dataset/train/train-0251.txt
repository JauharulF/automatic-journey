<START> im really addicted to caprica because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica it really has a slow pace start but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air br br i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season br br this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres br br eric stoltz does an amazing job as well as polly walker as clarice willow br br totally worth checking out br br catch caprica on fridays at 9pm 8pm central on syfy
<START> this is the movie that i use to judge all other bad movies and so far there hasn't been anything close br br the only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see
<START> this movie has made me want to become a director and michelle rodriguez is brilliant how the hell wasn't she on mtv's top 25 under 25 she beats them all this film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance best film i have ever seen
<START> the broadway musical a chorus line is arguably the best musical in theatre it's about the experiences of people who live for dance the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite br br the film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever br br the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for gandhi why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place br br which brings us to the next problem a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes it's the least flashy of broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory however that doesn't translate well to film and no one really thought that it would for that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class heck they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction br br many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director michael douglas whether he wants to hear them or not douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience br br while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play some heretical changes were made the very beautiful hello twelve hello thirteen hello love a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence was removed and replaced with the dreadful surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar adding insult to injury surprise simply retold the same story as hello love but without the wit or pathos br br there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film if you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is bob fosse's brilliant all that jazz while fosse's daughter is in a chorus line he is the fosse who should have been involved as director he would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort
<START> one of director miike takashi's very best it's so good it's difficult to put into words at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end br br it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that unlike today those films weren't afraid to scare there's a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what i grew up on the film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions you name it it's there a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy dysfunctional world into another inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins a quest to save both worlds from an evil force a beautiful heroine he has a crush on a sadistic henchwoman go go yubari from kill bill vol 1 a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth br br one of the imdb reviews begins where was this film when i was a kid and it's a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadn't grown up on it that it wasn't a part of my childhood like labyrinth masters of the universe and to a much lesser extent the neverending story those films and others like the goonies are recalled but never copied miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things br br poor cgi is a staple of many of his films sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice a desire to present things in an outlandish way here the cgi is mostly average solely due to budgetary limitations but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle the cg effects combine with traditional puppets animatronics and truly extraordinary make up to create a world filled with rich characters and characterisation that frequently borders on the visionary br br this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made not for younger or more sensitive kids though br br just jaw droppingly wonderful see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle appreciate it then show it to them let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't
<START> belushi at his most ingratiating and courtney cox before friends has a small role i often think belushi is under used in hollywood and this film role is one of his best for those of you who watch his tv show this is a very different and likable character the movie itself is not earth shattering nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although lovitz's whining can get tiresome and michael caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well meaning edge hamilton as belushi's wife is unfortunately two dimensional and one wonders why he married her in addition renee russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the prom queen who got away nevertheless a nice way to spend two hours
<START> i thought hedy burress who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one was going to be in part 2 guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 you know what i mean br br this movie like scream 3 and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie br br this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crap br br bad stay away
<START> as a lapsed catholic who had 11 years of catholic school but hasn't been to mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals i thought i'd get a kick out of this and i did for the first two thirds of the movie it was all the standard stuff strict parochial school teachings repressed sexuality etc but then suddenly the movie turned mean really mean now mind you i saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit and maybe i wouldn't have been quite so offended at such nasty hateful digs at the catholic church if i'd known about those abominations such a catholic term and coverups br br it's been a few years since i rented the video and i won't go back to rent it again with a new perspective it just left such a dirty nasty ugly taste in my mouth i wonder what experience all the actors had with the church because either they really hate it or they whored themselves for the paycheck it's an incredibly anti catholic movie offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for catholic education which i still do because there were no better teachers back in the '50s whatever else those nuns did they forced me to learn how to read and write the english language they made us memorize how many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads truth is there's nothing more essential for success in america can ya read can ya add subtract multiply divide great you can get any advanced degree you want and the discipline of catholic education will stand you in good stead not just as you continue your studies but also for the rest of your life no matter what you think of the catholic mythology we all had to learn br br such a great cast such a lousy rotten script i really feel bad and no it's not badly trust me the nuns taught me better for the writer and director br br i thought i had mixed emotions about catholic school but the participants in this project must've been those bad ie e stupid kids who sat in the back of the room if they were willingly involved in making this movie
<START> i love the doodlebops my son has been watching them for over a year we went to the doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday connecticut he loves them the doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares are you being serious the tv isn't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet the parents should get over it the doodlebops actually can sing deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing imagine they dance jump around and still sing they have talent the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show this show is by far the best show on tv for kids and a rock band for children how amazing is that why are people saying chad rooney is gay where did you hear that from whether he is or not he is awesome leave him alone its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children
<START> this movie has wild bill hickok calamity jane buffalo bill and general custer all together gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him this was the first time cecil b demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time this movie starts out with lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an indian war calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home this movie also deals with custer's last stand and is far from accurate gary cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like jean arthur but i liked her here
<START> i watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of william hurt natascha mcelhone and desiree nosbusch i'm glad that i had no idea of the presence of peter weller at the end of the movie i said that was peter weller kudos to mr weller for an outstanding performance weller played a major character and his performance was such that i didn't even recognize him br br overall the plot was bad the writing was bad and the performances aside from those of nosbusch and weller were subpar the scenery and setting were interesting and weller was amazing br br 4 stars of a possible 10
<START> this movie had all the elements to be a smart sparkling comedy but for some reason it took the dumbass route perhaps it didn't really know who its audience was but it's hardly a man's movie given the cast and plot yet is too slapstick and dumb blonde to appeal fully to women br br if you have seen legally blonde and its sequel then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel great actors such as luke wilson should expect better material jessica simpson could also have managed so much more rachael leigh cook and penelope anne miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing br br many things in this movie were paint by numbers the various uber clichÃ© montages the last minute misunderstanding even the kids' party chaos this just suggests lazy scriptwriting br br it should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously but it's such a glaring could do better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past
<START> whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre huh thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts mind forever thank you hammer the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one i've been looking forward to seeing mainly because the guy in the director's chair was don sharp one of britain's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films like kiss of the vampire and rasputin the mad monk as well as some overlooked independent productions like dark places and psychomania his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon the demonic guardian of the abyss the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device when he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics but david fischer's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits among which a highly inventive climax there's also plenty of tension to admire the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie recommended
<START> dog bite dog isn't going to be for everyone but i really enjoyed it full of slapping stabbing and shooting but don't worry Â the lead's a terrible shot it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia edison cheng plays pang a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister despite being filthy from his journey he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant if this sounds wildly implausible to you you should probably avoid this film it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief and i had a lot more fun for it br br chasing pang down is wai sam lee a young edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him and his father a legendary good cop is in a coma following a drug deal that went south the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings br br there are a car crashes lots of killings and a strange and awkward love story on offer here all played out in almost comic book style i suspect the humour was deliberate nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd though the over the top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members there are at least three points where the film might have ended and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing or the deletion of one of the narrative threads the light hearted stuff worked well so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers br br i'm inclined to give it a high pass however if only because of the ending Â i've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
<START> the egyptian movies has a lot of filmes with high level of drama or romance or comedy or action even sports ziab la ta'kohl al lam was banned in egypt because it content nudity full frontal female nudity and this kind of nudity is prohibited in the egyptian movies when i saw this movies i felt down fool story nude actress bad action some horror awful colors dear friend if you wanna see a great egyptian movie simply stay away form ziab la ta'kohl al lam we have great movies in egypt we have a great actors who won a global wins like omar el sheriff or gameel rateb we have great directors like yousef shahin so believe me pall you don't need to see this movie
<START> don't get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible there's freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didn't click one of the things that the director producers writers whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat coincidentally or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits zaniness of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust br br avoid this like a leprous prostitute
<START> well first off i'd like to add that i myself is somewhat of a historian so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts but this is however not the case here sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isn't entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying hitler wasn't anti semitic in his youth he even worked for jews before world war one it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate hitler as a child wasn't a disturbed little brat he had a more or less normal upbringing nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitler br br robert carlyle is a great actor but he doesn't really fit in the role as hitler hitler wasn't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait ed here under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms his unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war br br i'd like to see a film about hitler's life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations i really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this because it seems as if they didn't even know what really happened hitler wasn't even shot in the revolutionary march in munch his shoulder was ripped out of its socket br br it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this
<START> unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes br br for a short film the cinematography costumes sets sound editing and everything else is very very good this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals so the quality is to be expected the problem as usual resides in the story itself br br thing is it's not really a story to tell a story or in cinema's case show a story you need plot and conflict you need things that happen to the protagonist events these events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can't get it tim watcher has no problems or goals he's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind that's it so what we have here is pure exposition instead of being shown a story we're simply learning things about this tim watcher individual of course considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film's short duration it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice over narration in this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we'd never glean in fact if it wasn't for the vo we'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things to make it worse the vo also explains what's happening on the screen the images we're shown are just decoration for the text we're listening to br br i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something but because the images don't stand on their own it's impossible to say that what's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities not incredible but good but fails to entertain amuse thrill or at the very least show a story
<START> transylvania 6 5000 is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table the wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong the roger corman production transylvania twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early 30's so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references there's a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a mad raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory it's also revealed that he's actually more of a father damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters michael richards the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments i'm pretty sure john turturro's character in mr deeds was inspired by richards's role here
<START> i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years i'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece his triumph br br well if you take the film seriously like mr wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent film br br this makes the film very very good the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism a lot of black humour billy zane's role is absolutely excellent you see this is either high art or low rubbish br br
