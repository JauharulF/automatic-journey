<START> i used to love watching this i had no idea it was part of a larger series i must have been 6 or so at the time it was on tv i just thought it was funny and for some reason i had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the president's pile of bathtub toys my parents had taped this off of tv when it originally aired on nbc the tape even had the old sanka coffee commercial along with a few others i'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so if anyone of you would like to contact me i think you can do that through the imdb site feel free i will keep you updated and let you know when i have the show in a digital format
<START> this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven so dull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re dub his own lines leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped a few films before this was he has done this too but i don't think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty bad br br it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself don't bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film what's taken me so long to realize this
<START> the bfg is one of roald dahl's most cherished books but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there this version remains pretty faithful to dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on john hambley's script if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice overs one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant fun filled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic br br young orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a none too friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg voice of david jason the bfg refuses to eat people instead restricting himself to foul tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast every night as it happens on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the bfg become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else br br jason voices the bfg quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated sophie lacks appeal and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other even the places are uninventive giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences little of dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily one chapter in the book deals with the bfg's love of whizzpopping farting and is laugh out loud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre of the book in any department unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip
<START> this movie is a great mocumentary it follows the rap group nwh made up of ice cold tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and back to highs through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap for very good reason however i think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better the laughs never end even for someone not into the rap culture br br i'm a white guy that has no interest in rap music culture or anything else associated with it however i love this movie rusty cundeif who wrote the screenplay songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i haven't seen him since fear of a black hat however i have seen him one more time than you have and is that that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughs br br remember don't shoot to you see the whites of their eyes no don't shoot to you see the whites br br fym and enjoy the movie
<START> my mother took me to see this film as a child and i long to see it every year as i do all of my other christmas favorites what i remember most was the silly devil and santa looking through his telescope i waited and looked through the t v guide each year after that to see when it would be shown i would usually find it playing on a saturday afternoon i only found the movie in english which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in spanish i hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest yes it is a different film about santa claus and that is what makes it special and unique i can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories
<START> loopy but shrewd and formidable mob boss vic an excellent performance by richard dreyfuss gets released from a mental hospital several of vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman brass balls ben london a gloriously manic and over the top hammy portrayal by gabriel byrne the smarmy jake parker a perfectly smug kyle maclachlan and vicious rival wacky jacky jackson a neat turn by burt reynolds all try to bump vic off meanwhile laid back and self assured hit man mickey holliday nicely played with low key confidence by jeff goldblum finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy writer director larry bishop brings a supremely hip quirky and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch black comedy about betrayal loyalty and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok the bang up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums ellen barkin as tough sultry moll rita everly henry silva as vic's reliable right hand man sleepy joe carisle gregory hines as philosophical smoothie jules flamingo diane lane as vic's sweet perky mistress grace billy drago as the slimy wells and christopher jones as brutish rub out artist nicholas falco bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin nick popping up in nifty bits are billy idol as a blustery thug michael j pollard as the ill fated red joey bishop as mortician mr gottlieb rob reiner as a jolly chauffeur and richard pryor as jimmy the gravedigger byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer paul anka on my way rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight a tense and amusing climactic mexican stand off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical frank byers' slick cinematography the outrageously nutty dialogue earl rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one of a kind curio
<START> this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great incredible acting awesome special effects oh wait i must be thinking of a good movie well this wasn't one of them it just plain sucked br br what i want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10 when i casted my vote there were 206 out there god knows what goes on in their head now as for any other vote a 8 or 9 was even too high but a 10 come on what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10 i know these are the same 206 that thought that jean claude van damme is a great dramatic actor
<START> in the immediate aftermath following world war ii sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort best years of our lives' and even 'gentleman's agreement' investigated the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war but delmer daves' pride of the marines beat them to it br br the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole with japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies mariiines tonight you die he is blinded by a hand grenade and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home br br delmer daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave as it were almost by coincidence they are there in the foxhole and when shot at they react so much for heroism but they get the job done and then comes the self pity the dark gloomy sense of humor garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses there's no free candy for anyone in this world as his buddy tells him the same guy a jew played by dane clark reminds him in a war somebody gets it and you're it everybody's got problems when i get back some guys won't hire me because my name is diamond br br great movies are made with guts like these and if the first half hour of 'pride of the marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely from then on it evolves into a true work of art you weep and you ponder you ache and you hope against hope well simply art br br
<START> this film is something like a sequel of white zombie since it is made by the same man halperin and features zombies halperin the george a romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though br br we have a man who can control the minds of people in cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free also a love interest for the evil man br br where this film really excels is in the imagery the cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers unfortunately we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on br br i would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver and no strong villain like bela lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes and the use of lugosi's eyes a nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes overall a film that could be a great one with a little script re working and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same post war time frame heck if they can fix up the hills have eyes then this film has hope
<START> i enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him br br the spirit shines through in two ways a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon levitt and the heavenly herald al taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd its an energetic movie it gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport br br therein lies my gripe the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team there's absolutely nothing wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the toronto blue jays it's interesting really if it's just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay
<START> i am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence the movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review the movie fails not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games but because the movie sets it up as random and doesn't follow through let me clarify in aileen life and death of a serial killer you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous yet she is so troubled she really believes them to be true the viewer can make the distinction however in zero day the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this neo nazism talking about going on cnn with wolf blitzer which is laughable not only because they know his name but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie etc this movie doesn't depict 'reality' it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn't see this and you didn't pick up on it from my review either the entire movie is just taking michael moore's hypothesis and applying it to something real life in hopes of validating and it fails not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong but because the movie is wrong and doesn't support it of course i don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people but if i'm not mistaken didn't video tape exist of the columbine kids or some teen killers shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in doom hmmmmmmm the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media influenced but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a correlation exists but because the film maker doesn't know what hes trying to say and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it it's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'zero day' in retaliation if you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right go watch bully
<START> when this was released i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made however thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse language wise than this but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears hey i can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous in the first six minutes alone i heard a half dozen usage's of the lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f words i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 i couldn't have been the only one br br not surprisingly some of the feature actors included jennifer jason leigh burt young jerry orbach and rikki lake since this film stephen lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the godly stonewall jackson in gods and generals lang's role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film br br depressing gloomy semi pornographic repulsive these are just a few of the adjectives people used even some liberal critics in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel of course some of the better known critics all extreme libs praised the movie however they were the only ones most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public it's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this br br trust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie this is a mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era that is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people no thanks
<START> the above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit br br erotic scary suspenseful well thought out these are all the things this film fails to be br br it is however incredibly funny the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies i have seen in recent years and yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse br br throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like santa claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground this made me fail to believe the films title if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting oh well whatever besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title such as this one there has been a virus sweeping through america creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist and yet there's only four zombies in the entire film another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit in fact i believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters br br in fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor and so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous whilst i assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels editing isn't a hard job anyway right the only reason this movie found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with freddy vs jason strange how these things happen isn't it and the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess br br oh yes we did laugh at the end but i'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity
<START> another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts the attention to detail character and action is undeniably real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big budgeted star casted hyped productions other superhero related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people finally a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing batman the way it should be without the flashy rubber casted ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver i just wish that some sensible warner bros exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd i would never get tired of watching it just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this hope the bigwigs at marvel dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look no more batman robin fiasco or hulk daredevil etc learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie just to have it bomb in theaters mr collora we need more directors like you
<START> this was a watchable movie but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodney's earlier movies with that said it was worth the time to watch i gave this a 5 out of 10 so basically its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see but if you find it on the tube take a chance
<START> this game is amazing really you should get it if you don't have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it's just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it's fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in 1996 rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best
<START> ok i first saw this movie like at 9 00 on cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning boy was i 180d on that this movie bit the big one i mean the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie i'm going that's it why doesn't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie the plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women wouldn't it be better if they just went on you know a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters save the young woman women and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process i think it would be a hell of a lot better that way it also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first why not get rid of the mother first plus how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people she said it herself she was too weak what the heck was wrong with stephen this time i can never ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor after all they try their best if it weren't for good acting i'd have given this movie a 1 10 3 10
<START> this movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi actioner the hidden and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one br br dolph plays a butt kicking monk who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years he must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell the minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion possessed bodies br br if i'm making this sound entertaining forget it the pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career br br the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest br br too bad i really wanted to like this
<START> a woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son's friend and handy man in a slightly twisted story the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself the twisted part the handy man is also her daughter's on and off love interest br br as if this wasn't strange enough the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother br br though you may think badly of this woman the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light beautifully played by anne reid this character has dimension and portrays great emotion br br a truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film br br 8 10
<START> even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6 br br as a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans it felt this was a combination of pc mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about talk to those who have lived on horse back most treat their animals like family members regardless of background regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses i had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how pc showed a world different than what they knew in reality br br this dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view but if you live in an area similar to what is shown you may end up answering questions
