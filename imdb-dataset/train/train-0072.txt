<START> it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it's often foolish and illogical it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angel br br jeanette's deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach br br it's a surreal comedy tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
<START> the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon's most famous play about a tv newswriter named felix unger who is an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his divorced best friend oscar madison a sportswriter and complete slob after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment already divorced oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it neil simon's classic comedy first came to broadway with art carney playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar jack lemmon takes over for carney in the film version with a memorable performance as felix unger lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix unger matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as oscar a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout this teaming of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films with both of these actors no longer with us the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious simon's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed felix's suicide attempt that is a winner the supporting cast includes herb edelman john fiedler larry haines and david sheiner as oscar's poker playing buddies and moncia evans and carole shelley as the piedgon sisters blind dates of oscar and felix of course it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack klugman but there's nothing like the original a joy from start to finish
<START> after watching some of hbo's great stuff band of brothers rome etc i must say i had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of true blood jeez often the script seemed to be written by an 8 year old some parts are just horribly filmed the scene in which she saves bill i mean come on she throws a chain at the guy and ow it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion or a few moments before that scene when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill ridiculous she hears them plan their stuff and like 5 seconds later magic the 3 of them are gone and without any struggle or noise or anything br br i mean the idea of the show seemed interesting mysterious intriguing vampires co existing with human in our modern society but honestly i don't think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about unfortunately the script is written poorly mediocre at best it's shallow and extremely predictable often i thought that this was some kind of a joke or something br br the actors deliver really unconvincing performances if you want my opinion they seem to take the show very lightly as if it were some kind of a regular low budget family tv show well maybe thats what it is if you take away the family part the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen moyer in the role of bill considering the poorly written extremely short replies he had to say what are you can i give you a call sometime i think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have actually anna paquin was okay as well but not more but the guy playing her brother though jeez he's horrible the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television the acting is bad the construction site looks fake to the bone and the two other guys why is he getting arrested uh i dunno that was pretty embarrassing br br another thing that i think was completely missed was the way they presented sookie's psychic powers they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic as if people's thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think br br and finally the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting br br don't get me wrong i wrote all these comments not because i thought the show was bad but because i was very disappointed i expected quality stuff i didn't think it was going to be like that it's definitely not a good show though mediocre at best
<START> this show is beautifully done when it first came out i though it nothing more than a light hearted family comedy with quite a few good one liners it seemed to express many families really well too with different concepts of both parent and child however like i said i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening however my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter accrued the programme stood it's ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of john ritter a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything when the show aired after ritters passing i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me i thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children particularly that of bridget's character who was worried of the last words she said to him it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad i don't mean them and it's very important that he knows this great show
<START> this is such a great movie to watch with young children i'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over over gena was good cheech was fun the russian was good maria was adorable of course paulie was the best
<START> it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and let's not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman pretensions allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i don't get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspense horror films in robin wood's view it's a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that
<START> the viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one or why for that matter anyone bothered to make it there is no plot just random scenes of ridiculous action mia sara's shower scene appeals to the male libido but that's not much reason to make a movie
<START> this movie has it all sight gags subtle jokes play on words and verses it is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy if you watch this more than once you will find you are quoting it like animal house and yes i love animal house also i put in the top 15 funniest movies the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble in this movie he is right he is sadistic uncaring cruel and has to be taken down the group of boys that do not get along at first end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote a must see you will love it
<START> charles bronson stars as lt crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named duke juan fernandez who kidnaps the daughter of a japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed crowe's daughter amy hathaway in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller kinjite may not be for everyone with it's somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining
<START> a quite usual trashy italo western stupid storyline full of clichÃ©s and lack of logic some mediocre actors dirty settings lots of punch fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale br br this has nothing to do with django at least not in my german translated version this german dvd release is called adios companeros and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one he's the only survivor then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway yeah that's it no more cleverness in the storyline hehe br br a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable that's why i bought this dvd in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming i said love and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second fantasticfantasticfantastic br br it's also remarkable that joe d'amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography i love this master of incompetent exploitation thrash so it was an aahhh for me

<START> ten out of ten stars br br it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie just the phrase made of tv makes me shudder the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good it's my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes br br scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he's a pleasure to watch in fact i can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded the costuming location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing the musical score is endearing and heart warming add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas love selflessness and giving in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott
<START> back in 1994 i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation weekends and the holiday itself i stayed in town during that time hanging out at my parents' house a lot br br i didn't have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents' tube i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx i was hooked instantly i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates and often wondered about their history value etc br br after my long vacation i used to go to my folks' house on my lunch hours just to catch personal fx br br i can remember one episode during which co host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air br br it never did personal fx was the first and best of the collectible shows and it vanished from the air almost fifteen years later i'm still sore br br way to go fx
<START> the power of kangwon province is director hong sang soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected narratives in this case two and stories of troubled or troubling relationships as well as a potent dosage of irony br br one thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes br br again hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think i've come to love about hong's films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believable br br this is not a fast moving film there's a lot of lingering and like the previous film things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses br br power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision making it's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers 8 10
<START> the show is about two sisters living together holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister val has job boy friend fiancÃ© problems like most of the women on the planet they try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don't give up and continue and the show is also about friendship the priorities in life i loved this show so much it is funny and the actors are so good i am really sad that the show is over i still watch the reruns time to time amanda bynes is very talented jenny garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well she is one of the actresses i like watching i like vince and holly's relationship they are very natural gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up with tina holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent i would like to see her more this show really takes you in and makes you laugh i wish the show hasn't been over
<START> i have seen a lot of ppv's in the past but this is the most entertaining intense ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show such as the chris benoit interview edge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars era the first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk additionally there is a good music video br br 1 tag team table match bubby ray and spike dudley vs eddie guerro and chris benoit 7 10 this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat br br 2 wwe crusierweight championship jamie noble w nidia v billy kidman 3 10 the crowd really didn't care about either wrestler and didn't get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew you can tell by the lack of camera's flashing the ending was quick though br br 3 wwe european championship jeff hardy v william regal 5 10 i've never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match br br 4 john cena v chris jericho 6 10 it's funny looking back at cena's very first ppv how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview it's pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial jericho was sub par but definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins br br 5 wwe intercontenital championship rvd v brock lesnar 8 10 this was a very intense and good match both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with brocks pure power and raw energy vs rvds skill full moves and quickness rvd looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cena and the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brock's undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state br br 6 no disqualification match booker t v big show 7 10 another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table the finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t br br 7 wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm 5 10 this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesn't exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv br br 8 triple threat match for the undisputed championship 10 10 rock v undertaker v kurt angle br br easily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourself br br overall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money
<START> like many here i grew up with scooby doo unlike many here who did i love this show i think that it has been very well done and thought through everything about it marks it as a spin off which isn't meant to be taken seriously the formula is simple it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy by using the well known shaggy and scooby doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode br br there have always been scooby doo spin offs which have annoyed fans the classic being the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts from the 80's these spin offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold created new fans and kept scooby doo merchandise on the shelves i would agree that shaggy scooby doo get a clue doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best funniest scooby doo characters good features of the show the animation the voices the attention to detail the bad guys the best friend relationship between shaggy and scooby doo the constant humour bad features none although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times br br well done warner bros animation one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time
<START> the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival i thought it intriguing fascinating the sensitive bi sexual artist so very european so very dutch i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious sexual orientation persecution complex get a grip this guy is a freeloader living off of society i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy nightmares about the spiderwoman is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars and bed with strangers not only is he making outrageous sums of probably taxfree loot for making up stories lying guilt trip but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut hence he hustles the beauty salon owner then he has the nerve to complain about the bill but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films hmmm maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all
<START> i really love this movie saw it again last week after 3 years or so this movie is perfect great acting great story great directing camera work music it is a gift to show it to someone you love too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one top 5 work really br br today it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines anyway i saw le huitieme jour again yesterday this is with no doubt in my movie top 3 together with cinema paradiso which is also a masterpiece the soundtrack is also really good i am really curious about jaco von dormael's new movie i hope it will complete my movie top 3 if you see this movie rent it or even better buy it because you will want to see it again
<START> this is listed as a documentary it's not it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an american pie style comedy it's not that either br br basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a non hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls br br considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty br br if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this
