<START> gentleman jim not really a boxing film it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett but having said that the boxing scenes are a real eye opener to the modern viewer there are no 12 round points decisions here br br errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett his opponent john sullivan is still better however a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond br br the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment he is a liar and an egotist sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character br br there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all and errol flynn gets the girl
<START> once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a soviet era poster saying ne boltay meaning don't gossip i translated it for the generation of tv watchers as don't be gladys kravitz in reference to the nosy neighbor on bewitched br br however when you see the result of gossip in the pvt snafu short rumors you see that it's not quite a laughing matter in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafu well you know what i mean yes it's mostly wwii propaganda complete with a derogatory term for the japanese but i have to say that the pvt snafu shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices it's no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing
<START> before 'zavet' there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision they find their own poetic style and then they cowardly become prisoners of it burton has and still have depp kusturica has miki manojlovic and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again however there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time that's main reason why kusturica's worst movies are 'black cat white cat' and 'life is miracle' 'zavet' is something completely different you may like it you may hate it but this is not just another kusturica poetic Â balkanic dreamlike stuff of course if you want to be praised you have to play safe it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award fortunately as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works 'zavet' can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest like bergman or kubrick didn't have this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd so absurd that becomes deep and so unfunny that becomes hilarious same stuff that make 'plan 9 from outer space' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it average western viewer would not get few references most notable tire shop owner is srbljanovic and this refers to biljana srbljanovic famous serbian dramatic writer politically she is very active as left oriented liberal and she despises kusturica's political views and anarchism kusturica's 'everything but not subtle' take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop second reference is made to goran bregovic Â previous kusturica's composer he formed 'funeral and wedding orchestra' and start performing around europe although he is praised as big composer bregovic is just performer and most of his songs if not all are poor covers of traditional serbian songs kusturica's take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral with funeral mocking the wedding also music is covering western classics as 'london bridge is falling down' or french lullabies you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic's horrible covers i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody and it is beautifully directed as all of his works are if you like previous kusturica's movies there is a big chance that you will hate this if you don't like couple of his last movies you may find this as pleasant surprise because this is like fellini directing 'pink flamingos' on purpose i have massive respect for this guy after 'zavet' next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth that's the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not
<START> joe don baker is thomas jefferson geronimo a pudgy sweaty murderous oaf in a stupid cowboy suit that roy rogers would have laughed at somehow he still has a badge probably because he lives in texas and they'll let anything be law enforcement there br br this greasy loser is a deputy sheriff near the texas border not surprisingly he was once a texas ranger but got kicked out because he seemed to think that the law was his own personal bouncing ball to be played with at his discretion this includes shooting suspects who are over the international border into mexico beating up on suspects cheating in gun fights threatening women starting gunfights that could have been avoided and managing to get the life of a child threatened in the process letting women he promised he would help and protect get killed just so that he could get out of jail etc etc this guy makes l a cops look like saints in comparison br br when his partner is killed by a pair of wandering italian assassins joe don's character hunts them down and kills one of them then he takes the other to italy at the behest of a mr wilson who rightly thinks that joe don will screw up big time in record time he loses the italian and gets a maltese cabby blown up in the process this is just the first of the many deaths and major destruction that joe don leaves in a trail behind him as he rampages across malta looking for palermo the italian assassin br br thus begins the mobius strip part of the movie in which our hero gets arrested lectured by the maltese chief of police goes out and causes more trouble gets arrested gets lectured by the chief of police and so on and so on until you want to blow your brains out with joe don's ivory handled pistol and be done with the horror br br joe don proves his uselessness not just in the first time palermo escapes but in the subsequent boat chase in which he goes down in just one punch then he gets taken by palermo after he threatens a woman with a coat hanger you hope that palermo will actually get to torture him in the basement cell he's put in but no the stripper he threatened came and got him out because he promised to protect her her throat promptly gets cut big surprise and joe don escapes into the night br br and here you hope he might have been drowned in the yet another boat chase but even the ocean doesn't want him and spits him up on a shore where he's nursed by a poor maltese family what did they ever do to deserve that he returns to the city where he's arrested by the police lectured by the police chief arrrgghhh the female police officer who's been escorting him around frees him so that they can go get palermo why she would do anything so brain dead as to destroy her career for this great slob is beyond me it's just head scratchily puzzling br br they go out to the villa where palermo is hiding and start a shoot out joe don blithely cheats and kills palermo he then utters the great and dazzling last line of the movie the big one has my badge can you go get it for me thank you for that immortal line mr baker that will go down in the annals of movie history as the most literate amazing wondrous last line ever uttered by a character in a film it certainly falls into line with everything else about the character bravo
<START> as someone who's never been into sports it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football or as we americans inexplicably call it soccer themed bend it like beckham but i gotta say this was one cool movie anglo indian jesminder bhamra parminder nagra and her wasp friend juliette paxton keira knightley love to play football yes i'm going to say it the british and international way and just adore football player david beckham but jesminder's traditional sikh parents don't approve her mother offers a really whacked out description of football early in the movie okay so maybe it was sort of a clichÃ© in that sense but you gotta love this movie and if like me you go to this movie not knowing the definition of bend in football don't worry the movie explains it i'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie and we all know that keira knightley hit it big a few months after bilb came out in the states she starred in the equally cool pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl
<START> eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life you can compare it to any movie and i garuntee you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever this movie is about 1hr 45 mins and throughout that time there was barely a moment where i wasn't laughing you will laugh for hours after it is over replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career 48 hrs trading places beverly hills cop raw coming to america the nutty professor shrek etc but this is by far his most hilarious moment i have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time it never loses its edge from this day forward every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious and two thumbs up
<START> being a fan of cheesy horror movies i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try now that i've seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet i get my movie rentals for free and i feel that i didn't get my moneys worth i've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time hell i'm a fan of them but this was just an insult
<START> at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction however the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army the recognizable cast is hit and miss with glynn turman richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring best stephen boyd however stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn br br the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values the locations are great the effects and action are weak imagine if saving private ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel's caparzo had except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it then hanks damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax yet the denouement with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black and boyd's racist captain being effected by this is compelling as are the sequences of of turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines br br in short black brigade carter's army doesn't quite succeed but it's a respectable failure not a bad joke it could be remade as a very good film and as it stands is an interesting effort
<START> i have seen this film many times and i like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films however i do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched the script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding the story is well known and has already been described in other comments the two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are side splittingly funny not one swear word in sight mark that hollywood you don't have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless they don't make'em like this any more timeless
<START> this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever made while rebel without a cause and say anything deliver nice portrayals this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it this movie is mostly all dialogue based but every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is how in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests and no matter how many times i watch this film i don't think i will ever tire of that
<START> on the 1998 summer blockbuster hit baseketball 1998 this is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo tron screen in a sports bar during the day when everyone is quite drunk unfortunately i was sober when i saw this movie br br so quoted the late gene siskel for this lame brained supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior there's something about mary in a one upmanship game during july of 1998 mary was a gross out fest but in addition to the many gags it had a lot of heart which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer br br baseketball tried to outdo mary but it fizzled in more ways that one you take the creators of south park trey parker and matt stone who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera the only member of zaz david zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck and the other two jim abrahams and jerry zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture a small bit by now 90 years young ernest borgnine wasting his precious time in his distinguished career dying on a hotdog and singing i'm too sexy as he videotapes his will jenny mccarthy who has little screen time as borgnine's not too weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter a bigger female part by yasmine bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey robert vaughn as a corrupt archrival and pointless cameos by airplane alumni kareem abdul jabaar and the late robert stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the zaz family what do all these people make up a desperate cast and crew trying to replicate airplane humor and mixing it up with the crudity of south park but failing in every way br br to make this long 100 minute movie short baseketball a real game invented by david zucker and his friends in his hometown of milwaukee is about two lazy losers parker and stone and their pint sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball hence the title together on the driveway of one's house after borgnine dies he bequeaths the ownership of his baseketball team the milwaukee beers to parker and stone sure enough the game goes national and archrivals vaughn and mccarthy want to take away ownership of the beers team from them but bleeth is in love with both men particularly parker and one poor sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga ga over them those are the characters not strongly developed br br now witless gags ensue blood electroshock hair egg throwing and screaming are among them parker and stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital but he pulls through the liver transplant borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will mccarthy who seemed to get over borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away quickly massages vaughn in the next scene cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits there is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing and david zucker forces the parodies of riverdance and titanic parody forcing is nothing new to zaz post airplane and the naked gun series br br and like siskel i was sober as well but i was also getting sleepy this movie should be played over and over to coarse mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers but will they remain alert and awake or pass out during the unfunny parts if they pass out then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity hats off to them
<START> why is it that a woman cannot be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man the campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading tom sellick to the white house it's all she can think about so why on earth must she have had an affair with him it added nothing to the plot and served only to demean successful women the only value of that tidbit was the cute we've all slept with your husband scene br br also couldn't the people who made this movie have watched the national conventions they were spoofing airing between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process
<START> i have grown up with scooby doo all my life my dad grew up with scooby doo we have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue what planet are warner bros on allowing this shambles to air the characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister the story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins who are scooby doo fans too scooby and shaggy just aren't if anyone but casey kasem does the voice of shaggy it just isn't gonna work folks trust me br br this program was disgraceful what's new scooby doo is much better why change a winning format bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby
<START> a community pool in connecticut is the setting for this under the radar film which is charming funny entertaining and appealing although it won prizes in major film festivals the big bad swim was not released to hordes of theaters across america but was distributed in dvd form and shown in theaters selectively br br it is unfortunate that the big bad swim never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release considering how many sinkers hollywood has released this year such as i know who killed me the big bad swim a genuinely good independent film has had to swim upstream on its own br br nevertheless in the big bad swim actress paget brewster is endearing and believable as amy the wired to breaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job and ends up taking a gamble on a new life tv soap actor jeff branson who is hot plays noah the earnest vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students pretty sexy jess weixler did i just see her in a bank commercial deftly plays jordan the swimmer to be who works two jobs one as a pole dancer the other as a blackjack dealer her character provides the catalyst for change amongst the ensemble but is the least understandable of the characters because of a lack of a back story or motivation as to why she does what she does jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous video camera toting younger brother who spies on her however her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way which seems odd there's no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal attractive girl from a connecticut suburb would choose to be a self medicating pole dancer who debases herself for loutish bachelor parties br br despite this quibble the big bad swim succeeds in large part because it is a happy feel good film br br as one might expect learning to swim is the metaphor for life ultimately it's better to jump in with both feet and get in the swim rather than sit on the deck because life happens to you anyway br br the big bad swim is a great date movie a great dorm movie a great what haven't i seen movie and men like it as well as women
<START> this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news sports or satirical sketch comedy as a developer of situation comedy cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of king of kensington with the belly laughs of the beachcombers it is an embarrassment to great shows like kids in the hall and second city that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production br br i have to admit that i didn't give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept to start half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom successes in english canadian history corner gas the rest of the concept the cultural clash is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical but comes off as forced some of the jokes that are based around the local's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved especially the audience br br this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn't get it when it comes to creating canadian content especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy handed and forced way it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas i e the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines more realistically their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics br br that being said even as a formulaic fish out of water comedy this show fails the acting is weak the comic pacing all over the map and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief even for a comedy the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath who is horribly wasted here i doubt that even the addition of guest stars colin mochrie for example as an anglican archbishop can save this dog i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc's 'hype' had died down but two episodes were all i could stand i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline the time slot would be better served by airing more coronation street air farce re runs or dr who even an infomercial would be an improvement
<START> this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems br br the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i don't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference br br hope to see more movies like this in the future
<START> as i am no fan of almost any post desperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trash lite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to die hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which doesn't attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldn't imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasn't emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters' non histrionic style is at ease with the subject
<START> the problem with family dramas is that outside of tv movies on channels like lifetime most people don't want to watch them and the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news or recent news movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular particularly with the young crowd that would be miss lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios br br the specific problems i had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations it was a bit much to blame all of the lohan's character's acting out wrecking the car drug use etc on what her step father did to her while not improbable it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow additionally other aspects such as her giving the young morman boy oral sex or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother etc all these elements just did not really help this movie along it placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their special dramatic episodes then it did for a fully realized well written feature film br br when you watch the dvd and listen to the commentary particularly for the various alternate endings you can really see all of this is sharp focus
<START> this verson doesn't mangle the bard that badly it's still a horrible minimalist production hamlet's dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a spaniard whether it's ricardo montalban or not is subject to debate and maximilian schell overacts like never before most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed and the fact that the mst3k version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long duh doesn't strike me as incredibly humorous mostly it's just bad acting though
<START> what is really sad shows like six degree's and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellation's of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season i'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvd's and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
