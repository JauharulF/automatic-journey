<START> paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last i've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project all i have to say to that is are you kidding me come on it was not that bad at all i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography as for the rest of the movie i really didn't even notice it br br you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne sometimes that can be a bad thing but in this case its a really good thing he really becomes jason bourne in this installment damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen ezra kramer and julia stiles david strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret cia organization br br even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on this film stands far above the other two bourne movies and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season
<START> this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesn't it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was you're supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten who was murdered right after filming but patti hanson who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like stratten but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact stratten's part seemed forced added she doesn't have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless you're millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call for the rest of us it's an irritating snore fest that's what happens when you're out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest
<START> in director eric stanze's 'isoyc ipoyg' three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused the first victim is forced to eat his own crap before being axed to death the next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's corpse but it's the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily tattooed 'star' emily haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle oh he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too br br and unfortunately so do we get to see her masturbate that isÂnot get a broom handle up our butts br br yes 'isoyc ipoyg' is one harsh viewing experience not because of its relentless violence but because haack who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess as opposed to that of a roadie for metallica constantly gets buck naked for the camera it ain't a pretty sight br br in addition to the non stop nudity from an inked up haack viewers also get to see dreadful direction from stanze who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff some really bad acting and a fat guy's penis br br strangely enough i give 'isoyc ipoyg' a rating of 3 10 which is actually slightly higher than its current 2 9 average that's one point for the messy axe attack which being a gore hound i actually enjoyed one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces hilarious and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to meir zarchi's superior exploitation classic i spit on your grave
<START> michael keaton has really never been a good actor in the tim burton batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains here he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living br br well this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you because there's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained undiscovered and uninteresting so where's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that white noise makes a fool out of itself truly bad acting and horrifying edited this movie is nothing to watch michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever
<START> this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made whatÂ´s worse my old hero dolph is in it and heÂ´s starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way itÂ´s carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you canÂ´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyÂ´re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is Â§12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost canÂ´t be a cent above Â§1000
<START> i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable this isn't even a credible try to move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england but it must be a period piece even our story narrator the proprietor tells it in a flashback going back even further somewhere around 1800 towards the end of the 19th century a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought and the 20th century come on give me an expletive deleted break even around 1800 such behavior didn't work very well in view of the ending and the movie's ending i don't know what it was because i didn't watch the entire travesty i had to stop this was like setting streetcar named desire in elizabethan england
<START> my giving this a score of 3 is not what i would give the original soviet version of this film it seems that american international a studio that specialized in ultra low budget fare in the 60s bought this film and utterly destroyed it slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film plus much of this 64 minutes was new material such as the monsters so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original the original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of space though i really am not sure what it was originally for insight into the original film read steven nyland's review it was very helpful br br by the way this was the third soviet sci film i've seen that american international bought and then hacked apart to make a new film standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck provided of course it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place this americanized film was about two rival world powers not the us and soviets trying to be the first to mars the tricky bad guys try but fail and the good guys rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to mars unfortunately they are temporarily stranded on a moon of mars where they see some monsters added by american international that are reaaaally cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female's anatomy then they are rescued returning to earth heroes br br the bottom line is that the film was butchered turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art for the time being turned into a grade c movie because of this the soviets really had a reason to hate america i'm just shocked that the horrible job a i did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks it's worth a look for a laugh but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between so the film is a dud not bad enough to make it a must see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously i would really love to see this movie in its original form it must have been some picture
<START> great great great that is all i can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so i'll elaborate the cast was great jerry o'connel is soooo cute the music was great the sixties had the best music ever imho the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s and most of all the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama but in one word great
<START> its a shame she didn't get screen credit she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross best part of the movie she had much more impact than avril or just about anyone else in the film she almost made s m look like fun she really was believable has the s m model that gets scared of her situation although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot this is one film were both cuts should be made available it seems they left out a lot of what was shot and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming what was shot would not have gotten a r rating probably a nc 17 or x but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been
<START> one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business br br at the time in 1994 this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold it was held in pittsburgh pennsylvania no doubt in honor of the original film's angels who haunted the pittsburgh pirates in this remake they haunt the california angels br br anyway the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held and may even continue to hold the record for the largest movie premiere in history shown to 60 000 fans danny glover tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans
<START> autobiography of founder of zoo in nyc starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his mother's wishes this might scare younger children esp scenes where buddy tries to injure gertrude rather quick resolution at the end below average
<START> all i can say after watching snitch'd is please stop mr cahill it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research it's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak br br i laughed at the part when mr cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related br br snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made
<START> following their daughter's brutal murder julie and allen escape the city to find solace and grieve in a solitary cabin on a remote mountain allen's intentions are good he wants his wife to get out of her depression by resuming her photography julie stumbles across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy decaying setting for her photography but when the photos are developed they are full of dead people and allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain dark remains is a pretty decent indie horror flick it offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension the acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great 7 out of 10
<START> at first sight who's singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedyÂ with only a kind of unusual quiet and slow motion what a mistake br br beginning with two singers on a desert landscape then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors it hides a gem br br the folded story and a false rhythm induces you to think yes it is comic but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie br br not at all very funny by instant dark subtle cynical on others its development surprises you all along the storyÂ very ingeniously and cleverly presented all the characters are important and the actors give them full life br br and what is astonishing it's based on deep observation great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings and really everything the general direction and how also the details are presented that it simply makes you forget it's a movie it is like to watch a kind human society you yet don't know shot by a friend behind a camera br br and you're the one behind him it is simple and simply exceptional br br don't misunderstand me in no way that would means the script the quality of picture the music score have a kind of amateurish way no no it's great art br br because it flows like a riverÂ from high up in the mountain down to the sea with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the seaÂ from a tiny thing to a main stream br br this metaphoric image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has who's singing over there for me again i take the hammer simply exceptional br br i've seen that the director is the one who made chat blanc chat noir which i know is quiet famousÂ but as i yet didn't see it i had no idea about this gentleman br br others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film i fully agree br br european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated but i am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language with good english subtitles all in all deep delicious and exceptional br br for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs avoid it at any cost it may be too subtle and good for you br br but if you're interested in different genres and or classics i guess you won't regret this one and in case of buying it will have good companionship in your personal dvd library with such no less than merited big names like billy wilder lubitsch or sacha guitry among some of my preferred directors at least for this movie br br a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles
<START> one of the silliest movies of the 1940s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser kyer orchestra leader and radio star and eternal college fraternity goof off was sort of the precursor to spike jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall the shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is over confident kyser yukking it up with elbow in the ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years from
<START> this movie is excellent i found it very interesting i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool the acting was also great as well as the costumes production photography directing and script br br a very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them br br see this movie it's worth it kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up
<START> i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out as good as it is on dvd it's even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about 9 years since i have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just don't make 'em like this anymore if sixth sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i highly recommend you not watch it alone what a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone will have you gasping it would be at least 10 times that price today
<START> as a former submariner this was one of the worst submarine movies i have ever seen first of all a mutiny aboard any us naval vessel particularly a nuclear powered trident submarine in unthinkable these men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission the responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the most junior crew member i could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer an executive officer who acted as the character played by denzel washington did would be relieved of his duties and court martialed then drummed from the navy it is no surprise the navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film lastly if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection they don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway i was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway loud music would never be tolerated i know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous i would not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> scary movie 2 was a grave disappointment simply referencing movies like mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy the movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of james woods ands andy richter the movie plummets from there unfortunately the acting is awful tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie involving joints and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie werent funny to anyone in my theater the movie thankfully comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers overall a very poorly done movie
