<START> i watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then i'm pretty forgiving of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know it's suppose to be a comedy but i didn't find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying
<START> bad plot though good for a b movie good fast paced fight scenes at most a 5 out of 10 but something has always bothered me about this film how come mariska hargitay never speaks in the tv version she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman even a kiss in a garden yet in the regular video version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all this bothers me because it not only takes out a female though cliched point of view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that undercuts whatever speakman says
<START> there are so many incorrect statements in this so called documentary that i found myself shouting at the television br br bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims br br he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims br br what's more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sites br br further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions br br all of the claims made by mr sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven br br how do i get that 40 odd minutes of my life back
<START> i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad what the movie glorifies child molestation oh but sylvia kristel was naked in it so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars why not a full 10 because the filmography was agonizing the child's looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime to me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar i would still have to give the movie only 1 star that tv's howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous but don't take my word for it
<START> holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho it's a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell there's no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992's beyond the mind's eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
<START> i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time but he changed my views i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since i even bought several of his cd's who cares what his acting abilities were he basically just played himself which was adorable he was so charming so charismatic i honestly just wanted to hug him i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly it was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent he will definitely be missed
<START> i found this movie to be very well paced the premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed the pacing is done very well for those that like to think enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep arising which are later answered producing a well thought out and very satisfying film both cerebrally and from an action standpoint br br it seems some people were looking for a non stop roller coaster ride with this film one of those that comes charging out of the gate this would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill creating a wonderful sense of anticipation and is ultimately in my mind more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid br br excellent film
<START> against all hope is a very poorly made sometimes painfully so movie this is michael madsen's first movie and it shows he isn't that good in it some people might find the story laughable an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help after telling the preacher his story he accepts jesus christ into his heart br br i actually found many of the religious scenes as when cecil moe madsen goes to a church but walks away from it pretty realistic i also liked how cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help but realizes only god can help him at the end he realizes with the help of god he can go through life without drinking again br br this movie is not well made at all the acting is bad the script could use some work and looks worse than my home videos but it has a good message now just because you become a christian doesn't mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family and cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track overall if your a christian you will appreciate how this movie portrays christianity and if you aren't you may find yourself being called to find out more about the faith
<START> a sober reflexive piece a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen this quiet little story will hold you enthralled if you do not have too many problems with the various spanish accents ranging from mexican to peruvian and marisa paredes' more authentic iberian peninsular usage garcÃ­adiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel even the grand maestro garcÃ­a mÃ¡rquez should be proud of her superb work and hats off to arturo ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem a ruby and so refined so elegant so sensitive so touchingly br br el coronel fernando lujÃ¡n is waiting to get his pension while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the colombian jungle however filmed elsewhere not in colombia with his fighting cock and his wife in that order and that is all there is to it br br but oh so much more this film is a rhapsody br br i must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible worth the high side of 8 out of 10 which is very high on my scale br br this is not light commercial hollywood stuff
<START> what can i say i'm a secret fan of 'over the top' action and horror films especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo but i'm not a fan of snake on a plane br br there are three potential draws to this film Â the comedy of the situation Â the horror and Â the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane br br firstly this film isn't written as a tongue in cheek horror or a comedy and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself if you want to get the feel of the film the trailer genuinely represents the movie a horror br br secondly if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks you won't be disappointed it doesn't stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attention br br thirdly although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn't wear off but you'll leave the cinema thinking what was all the fuss about br br i know this movie has a high rating but it doesn't add up a many of the reviews where written before the film was released and b the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77 of people rating the movie 10 10 with only 7 of people giving it 9 10 why such an enormous gap
<START> anne bancroft plays estelle a dying jewish mother who asks her devoted son ron silver to locate reclusive one time movie star greta garbo and introduce the two before estelle checks out for good might've been entitled bancroft talks as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic dramatic sentimental material for its duration hot or cold director sidney lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going and bancroft's constant overacting isn't scaled back at all by the filmmaker he keeps her right upfront cute teary eyed and ranting estelle becomes a drag on this scenario not that the thinly conceived plot has much going on besides silver and co stars carrie fisher and catherine hicks end up with very little to do but support the star and everyone is trampled by her hamming 1 2 from
<START> when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween i was very excited when i found out that it was a book written in 1978 i had to read it before seeing the movie i'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book with minor differences naturally i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of col i'm not a big fan of boyle and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie she's always trying to use her over plumped lips and darkly makeup ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy indeed i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house my favorite subplot was the sheehan family which is so weird b c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is casey sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti iraq tirade in the book obviously the war was not iraq but rather vietnam and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter i was truly creeped out overall i was impressed with the movie in that it followed the book very well
<START> the wayward cloud is a frustrating film to watch infuriatingly enigmatic it treats each shot like a work of art you get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction the camera here hardly ever moves Â apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken this curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that even as the story progresses at a snail like pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed unfortunately for me at least this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark i began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of wills br br had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to western audiences as it is there's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so repugnant that while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so over zealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fast forward button of the remote br br for all its problems the film is definitely a stayer and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make ironically for a film in which so little happens the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time for me however once was enoughÂ
<START> john ben chaplin is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london though the internet he contacts a russian agency of brides he selects sophia nicole kidman Â the guy could be lonely and shy but certainly has a good taste doesn't he and when they met each other he realizes that she does not speak english the communication between each other is basically limited by sex again imagine what a terrible situation for the guy just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman on her birthday two russian friends of her visit them then lots of surprises will happen i liked this movie first it is almost impossible to be 'labeled' is it a black comedy an action a thriller movie i believe all the choices are correct nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual and i am very curious about her russian is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed or just faking anyway i found it an enjoyable movie my vote is eight br br title brazil a isca perfeita the perfect bait
<START> this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman can you say horrible rip off of samara the ring don't get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge 1 10 yuck
<START> if you are uninitiated to the gundam world this is a good place to start if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic sci fi series you can become immersed in not the simplistic boy saves world in giant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinct br br gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice br br i loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment
<START> for those with little time on their hands i'll sum it up quickly in one word pathetic there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description so much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes you got it the reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap you can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for br br i've watched many a movie franchise decline over the years but american pie beta house has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie it's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck br br the plot is predictable and sometimes you actually feel like you're watching a school play the things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it we're talking star wars levels of suspension like the kind you need to convince yourself jar jar is real br br the plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke there is no acting talent to speak of all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh and ohhh how they fail every gag falls flat and the only thing i laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be how else can you explain the bulls t they try to pass off as a story br br they pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written lowest common denominator nonsense the characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of beta house but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening its a very lazy way of telling a story it also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so imagine say the wizard of oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it and all we see is dorothy high fiving the scarecrow every now and again and saying gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then lazy lazy lazy br br the female characters have little or nothing to say all they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie you braindeads that only seek t a will not be disappointed but for that reason alone shame on you if you buy this on dvd you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way congratulations
<START> this movie is awful i haven't laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time leno should've stuck to stand up and late night tv the cars in the movie were cool but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie i've ever seen it's pathetic the acting is horrible and the plot could've been written by a 4 year old don't get me wrong jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie
<START> i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb i worried about seeing a bad movie well i had fun watching the movie some parts which obviously were meant to be scary were actually quite humoristic almost as in buffy the vampire slayer br br i don't consider this a bad movie it's not a great movie either just a rather well made horror movie it does not rely heavily on special effects but on camera angles acting music in my opinion the acting was ok sarah did a very good job quite convincing the other actors were definitely not bad either i liked yoko br br the sets are nice and i don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original br br the scary moments were often predictable but not always i have seen quite some horror and did not expect to be scared now but it happened at least twice nice br br the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original like the trails of rubbish the simple special effects for he ghosts the eyes of the boy the cat that made eery noises the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother br br don't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode because it is very different from her buffy work much more serious don't go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations it's a good horror movie enough suspense i gave it a 7
