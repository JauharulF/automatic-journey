<START> a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating the premise seems simple enough yentl a girl interested in studying the talmud wants to go to school but only boys are allowed to study so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in she does and becomes close friends with avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass hadass' family learns avigdor's brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off yentl now calling herself anschel is then selected to marry hadass she does but it is never consummated yentl anschel and avigdor go away for a few days and yentl anschel reveals her secret to him the movie ends with avigdor returning to and marrying hadass and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise br br the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long but there are several things that ruin it for starters there is the constant singing i can already hear the critics shouting yes i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them the songs become tedious after a while and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice over only one song stands out from the rest papa can you hear me it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren't necessary br br second streisand's makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl anschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even hadass into believing she is a man yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing there seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn't think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways the facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair nevertheless in the 1900s if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as streisand's character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country therefore the feminine makeup on streisand does not lend to the character's credibility and only weakens the plot if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful it should have been scrapped br br thirdly when yentl anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand's and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom made vehicle for streisand to fuel br br lastly there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs to those i must respectfully disagree while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities i am not a fan of her style of singing however i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals there are even some songs of hers that i like so i am not a hater nor have set out to bash her i have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie several times even and has noted the problems within if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear self absorbed and thus turn the film into a laugh fest unworthy of her fans or audience

<START> the new batman adventures also called gotham knights takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman the animated series b tas and only aired for 24 episodes this isn't a horrible show but it just isn't as good as the original batman animated series i'll start with all the things that i found not to be very good br br first thing's first the animation itself long and sweet gotham isn't dark anymore the sky is always bright red and orange b tas did this also but it was drawn on a dark palate do the colour of the sky was more ominous in this show the colour of the sky is too bright it all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like batman tas did with it's dark cool art style on gotham the art style is ok but doesn't remind me of batman anymore every character is comprised of straight lines squares and triangles making characters look less human like in the original series b tas characters look more like drawn versions of real people the animation may be more consistent here than in b tas but it definitely isn't as good br br next some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b tas two face attempting to kill tim drake robin 2 and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment this leads me to my next point br br because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe many villains do meet their demise or leave forever poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes two face nearly kills penguin killer croc and himself so he's moved to arkham forever joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant though he will return later on the justice league animated series catwoman moves away to france leaving batman etc just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters the villains' motives are pretty bad too there are none in b tas we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined that's why they act the way they do in this show the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story it's like batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights he just beats them senseless this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character but since he's been doing this job for years i can see why he is so harsh br br next the redesigned character models they're awful gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds is he sick many villains look stupid joker riddler catwoman mr freeze mad hatter and killer croc are among the worst although i do think that some characters look better bane scarecrow batgirl harley is about the same and ivy who is even hotter now has pale green skin br br with the series having many faults some episodes are great over the edge mad love beware the creeper girls night out old wounds legends of the dark knight and never fear are my favourite ones here in my opinion all of the crossovers featuring batman in the superman animated series were great also br br the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original on the dvd features of the original batman animated series they talk about how proud they were with the art style and how difficult some characters were to animate but they did eventually succeed with the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface for example on the dvd features of the new batman adventures the creators basically say to hell with b tas this is a fresh new re vamp it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series alright that is an exaggeration when the creators cast away the amazing art style of b tas that really annoyed me br br it's not a bad show but i still don't like it as much as the original animated series at least the show doesn't talk down to its audience so for that reason i still commend it though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching br br superman the animated series and justice league the animated series are great follow up shows to batman the animated series and the new batman adventures so give them a watch as well
<START> i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for 75 million now a days those things cost about 3 billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didn't mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane
<START> i got hooked on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to pearl tv in hong kong it caught be my surprise as it was a break from listening to anything chinese but i started getting reeled in as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful nothing too unbelievable though i think it's very very stereotypical of them to write damien as a potential black man with a sheet that has been the most disappointing aspect the rest is great and i'm sad to learn on imdb that i can't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the us i'm am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste but just as shows that show characters getting closer it's probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks
<START> creep your journey terminates here some very graphic scenes and well yeah that's about all for this film br br no real plot no storyline no likable characters well 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is i mean they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers who is this thing why is he there that's quite scary i guess but do i really care no i don't why don't i because i don't have a clue who these people are and i don't know if i should want them to live or die it's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you which it rarely does br br this film lacks any meaning any purpose it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up it jumps right into the action basically some women and her friends get locked in the london underground get chased by a weird creature then they eventually escape from it br br creep has its moments which make you jump the art is good the location is excellent and the sounds are ok but that isn't what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately all that goes to waste br br it's nothing new another predictable modern 'horror' where kate the lead 'character' consistently does the stupid hey i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation but oooh no i'm going to do the total opposite because i'm a dumb blond thing i wish they wouldn't do that it's done so many times it's boring and gets predictable in fact i'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the erm grey alien looking creature br br your journey terminates here is the films tag line well creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film if you've had a few beers got a couple of mates back at yours then sure watch it by all means but if you want something original and clever avoid
<START> the great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 this twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the âgolden eraâ of the genre there were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals sinceâ¦ but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period singinâ in the rain an american in paris the band wagon seven brides for seven brothers oklahoma south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the âgolden eraâ is carol reedâs 1968 âoliverâ freely adapted from dickensâ novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production it is a magnificent film winner of six oscars including the best picture award br br orphan oliver twist mark lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him following an incident one meal time he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour but oliver doesnât settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the artful dodger jack wild who in turn works for fagin ron moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child thieves despite the unlawful nature of the job oliver finds good friends among his new âfamilyâ he also makes the acquaintance of nancy shani wallis girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all the menacing bill sikes oliver reed after many adventures oliver discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well to do background but his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when bill sikes forcibly exploits oliver making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies br br âoliverâ is a brilliantly assembled film consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin lester and wild do well too as the young pickpockets while wallis enthusiastically fleshes out the nancy role and reed generates genuine despicableness as sikes the musical numbers are staged with incredible precision and sense of spectacle â onna whiteâs oscar winning choreography helps make the song and dance set pieces so memorable but the lively performers and the skillful direction of carol reed also play their part the unforgettable tunes include âfood glorious foodâ âconsider yourselfâ âyouâve got to pick a pocket or twoâ âiâd do anythingâ and âoom pah pahâ â all immensely catchy songs conveyed via very well put together sequences the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire 153 minute duration sit back and enjoy

<START> i don't get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budget it has very good cinematography it has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too then why oh why didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can't act their way out of a paper bag this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all br br so i would say it's a good production but a bad movie too bad actually br br and eels come one really
<START> i am of the christopher reeve generation it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top though he just barely falls short that doesn't stop me from enjoying this film it has a lot going for it it has all that a movie needs a plot with beginning middle and end plus all those parts are intelligently written the film is edgy both in acting and storyline something a film noir but with tights the story is both exciting and meaningful this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days oh the glory days of hollywood when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell the film is polished and expertly made directed by lee roll'em sholem best known for directing with both speed and efficiency it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman's point of view also a few closeups of george in process work and a long shot of an animated superman br br this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series a dvd worth owning in its own right the inclusion of the film as its original whole is icing on the cake br br give blood today god bless
<START> cybil richards directs another full moon surrender cinema masterpiece of erotica this time jacqualine lovell dressed in rather fetching silver outfit is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity however she can't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below she also fits in a little lesbian activity to be honest lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the 'drama' utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features mediocre even for surrender's output and clearly a new budget low for them also
<START> i hadn't heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website which made me curious as a cartoonist and illustrator myself i'm an admirer of richard williams's work i rate ziggy's gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals but it seems the man has his faults most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super talented individual like williams can go given the right circumstances br br raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children's cartoon it tries also to be a musical it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well is it a freakout is it a mind blower is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations it's beautifully animated for the most part though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention but even that doesn't count for much when you're confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the 'action' here br br there are a number of problems with the film but let's start with raggedy ann and andy themselves they're the stars of the show yet they have no personalities actually we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy i'm no girl's toy he sings and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner a little girl called marcella carries her upside down but that's all we get to find out about these dull as mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after i use the word weirdness advisedly because some weird films can be hugely entertaining but this is just flat out strange the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable but they're actually bizarre and disturbing the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this but even they're relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll yes this is supposed to be a children's film then there's the music none of which is memorable and all of which is sung by actors who can't sing and to add insult to injury there's a lot of singing in this film when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are about how they'll always have each other and yes we get the message this seems to go on forever but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film not for long though because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it's made from worn and faded denim and bad enough that he's clearly a paranoid schizophrenic he also starts hallucinating but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow the greedy a living breathing belching farting constantly eating pool of taffy is so trippy creepy and ultimately disturbing you'll hardly believe what you're seeing this is as close to a drug free psychedelic experience as i've ever seen on film then after a l o n g time spent with the greedy along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo whose throne resembles a urinal i can't believe i'm actually writing a capsule description of a real film here i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i'm not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked out nightmare i had part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay little nemo cartoons for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it probably all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it but there isn't these scenes are just strange and very very long surrealism only works when there's a strong idea behind it or takes place against some semblance of reality but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality take away this element and you're left with pure self indulgence br br as the final scenes unravel even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship ludicrously detailed jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production and there's a non event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out even at a meagre 86 minutes in length the film feels like a never ending ordeal and it's understandable why it flopped on its original release animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly but he did and there's nothing anyone can do about it

<START> this movie has not aged well maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we've seen with the sopranos but i just viewed prizzi's honor for the first time on dvd alone br br the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but i have to say i was just appalled at the ending not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending br br i enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character also when was this move supposed to be set the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes br br another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person br br somehow mid 1980s audiences found this film charming and funny mid eighties meet the late oughts only of you can live
<START> moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life not surprisingly they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire the guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story the group calls the cops the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it's a mountain lion and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost br br moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention one guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn't bother to load it then after he finally loads it he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn't bother to because that would end the movie too early then he throws the gun away also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don't look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn't help and in the end it tries to get away with it's incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie br br then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces again br br mediocre of it's kind good only for some unintended laughs br br 1 2 out of
<START> you are warned this is a spoiler this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it they must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle
<START> the notorious bettie page 2005 br br directed by mary harron br br starring gretchen mol chris bauer lili taylor sarah paulson david strathairn br br mpaa rating r for nudity sexual content and some language br br it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life from ray charles to johnny cash biopics are very posh right now the notorious bettie page is the latest of these to be released on dvd it features gretchen mol as the world's most famous pin up model bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color unlike ray walk the line and finding neverland however this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie page's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested this does not mean however that it is a bad movie in fact the notorious bettie page is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie a solid work of cinema this film focuses more on page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about br br everyone knows bettie page played by mol whether you know her as an iconÂor a simple porn starÂyou know her she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time now most people know her as one of america's first sex symbols a legend to many models especially those of playboy and other adult oriented magazines she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and page's bondage style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar in fact the photos launched a full fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn br br the performances in the notorious bettie page are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant i understand that when she was announced for the role many people were skeptical her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances now it will she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance david strathairn is fresh off of last year's good night and good luck in which he gave one of 2005's best performances here he gives yet another fine performanceÂeven though he is slightly underused i was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasÂbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in the haunting 1999 while most people ignored the movie i found it to be an enjoyable if not completely shallow horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally distraught nell here taylor gives yet another credible performance she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol br br after everything was said and done i realized that the notorious bettie page cannot be compared to other biopics such as finding neverland and walk the line it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end her personal life is briefly implied but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will haveÂbut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself after all she was an adult model turned christian missionary this movie does not over dramatize anything it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of her pastÂand yet it does not the notorious bettie page tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards fortunately it is quite refreshing br br final thought the notorious bettie page is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography br br overall rating 9 10 a

<START> i went in to see d war on a whim and with very low expectations the movie failed to meet them br br i don't mind stories that stretch credulity remember reign of fire but i do expect them to be internally consistent this film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of lotr or even godzilla br br a shape shifting mystic warrior from korea curiously metamorphosed into a caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely boned up on ancient korean folklore because of the fed's excellent paranormal division which has gone unremarked up to this point lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims i never meant for this to happen a reincarnated pair of long dead koreans who died like star crossed lovers mystic pendants faceless hordes of robotic soldiers that owe a lot to peter jackson's orcs and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it br br the dialogue is appalling the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was to be honest tedious however for me the crowning moment was at the end after the finale when the music for the closing credits was arirang this is rather like akira kurosawa closing ran with a karaoke rendition of my way and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director shim to kurosawa br br in short a self indulgent lackluster collection of clichÃ©s and narrative non sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer or even a not so serious movie goer i would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video but i'm not even sure that it's worth that much
