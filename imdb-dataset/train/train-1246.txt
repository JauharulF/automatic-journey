<START> this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings at one point he even enumerates one two three four as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event and people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeed br br unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren't given good enough lines glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent
<START> it's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you've guessed it that film is parasomnia i've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing but it seems fairly transparent in this case br br that's not to say parasomnia is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be br br on the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too br br although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don't want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life br br all in all there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special
<START> i watched 'envy' two nights ago on dvd at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential but it completely fails to deliver i watched it with about five friends and no one laughed for the entire film the jokes which are few and far between are not funny in any way the story line is crap and they never answer the question where does the sh t go of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacks any sort of comedy value and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j man none of the characters are developed the plots so thin it's nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny
<START> this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the start br br and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark uav's aren't armed they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation called r i p l e y we are introduced to hacker will farmer he's good at chemistry electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker his love interest annie will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company br br wills taking money from his neighbours bank account mr massude isn't a hack he helped him set up the account we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war they play the dead code the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will br br exactly why ripley shut will's machine down isn't explained he's only playing an online game also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable as for ripley activating his mobile phone i think not it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad hacking science there too br br ripley agents arrive at massude's home take him away will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn't a hack as you never see him break into the dmv computer the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him will's mother hadn't been stealing chemicals bio agents either and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis patriot act or not br br i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us br br the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will his mother dennis wasn't sanctioned by a government agency the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system br br the guy who ran into annie at the airport was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips br br another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced the joshua project we discover that the guy who ran into annie is falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own death br br we also get to see wopr as what's going to help them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then falken wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill will annie the russian it's also unlikely they'd create a self contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of br br the whole decontamination plot idea are totally unbelievable those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff so yet another laughable unbelievable idea br br the ip hacks against ripley aren't done by will he just contacts one of his friends who suggests implements the idea it's excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley's operating temperature having joshua as a backdoor into ripley especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible cop out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with br br there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown saying 17 minutes then ripley says decontamination in 30 minutes how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer ripley's attack mission against philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she's doing won't work surely she'd already know if she had joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie is yet another nod back to the original movie br br their cop out at having ripley repeat joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with br br if you want to point fingers for bad stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat rob kerchner this is an awful movie and is best avoided
<START> when i had first heard of solar crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw it br br now i know br br for a movie that encompasses outer space the sun vast deserts and sprawling metropolises this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back br br and the effects while good are pretty underwhelming we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare but other than shouting sweating and a red glow about everything there's no real feel of emergency br br don't get me started about the cast what heston palance matheson boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood br br and as far as the end goes well let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of solar crisis sooner br br two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves br br i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this
<START> rock 'n' roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal mary woronov of eating raoul fame the whole movie is a mile a minute it's basically a big excuse to have fun and i'm sure that you will bullied freshmen check a dorky music teacher paul bartel also from eating raoul check exploding mice checkmate br br anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living even for someone like me who doesn't know the ramones' music it's pure pleasure with roger corman executive producing and joe dante co directing how could we expect anything less too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack ii br br also starring p j soles vincent van patten clint howard dey young dick miller who has appeared in every one of joe dante's movies and many of roger corman's don steele and of course the ramones a real treat br br it seems like bartel and woronov always co starred they also co starred in joe dante's hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall also starring dick miller in which they reprised their roles from eating raoul
<START> more than just a kids' movie holes looks at how past incidents still affect us today whether we know about them or not when teenager stanley yelnats iii shia leboeuf gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection to it through flashbacks we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize you'll understand this better when you see the movie leboeuf does a pretty good job as do the other cast members sigourney weaver jon voight tim blake nelson henry winkler patricia arquette and eartha kitt a very interesting movie
<START> to all the haters out there condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages that being said i was a huge fan of bsg thought it was some of the best tv drama not just sci fi on the air but it was time for it to end and the story to move on i liked the bsg epilogue the plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so i eagerly anticipated caprica and i was not disappointed br br i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg and i was pleased that caprica is something different and i personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and sci fi special effects don't get me wrong i like that stuff too eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances and alessandra was just wonderful i can't wait until next week
<START> how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie congo express 1986 there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other jean de congolees the workman the two taxi drivers the street singer roger guy lucienne and gilbert of course tom barman is a star and luc gubbels wasn't that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script if there is a script of anyway the wind blows the joke the only one at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie de witte 1934 where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres another missed chance for flemish cinema
<START> i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters however i wasn't able to get around to it so finally it hit the shelves and i picked it up not knowing exactly what to expect i plopped the dvd in the player settled in the for an evening of murder and pressed play what followed was one of the more engaging flicks i've seen in the last couple years br br some spoilers br br this is the story of the wonderland murders which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70's john holmes val kilmer br br i was hooked from the beginning and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning and the actual showing of the murders towards the end the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star and even the beautiful but that's it bosworth was a joy to watch and just for her looks mind you br br i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was as i mentioned its lack of outright showing the murders it was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you couldn't completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome furthermore the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite they were being beating with lead pipes there's not much more that needs to be said br br my only real problem was carrie fisher's brief appearence her portrayal of the overly religious figure was i think a bit too cliche of her appearence maybe that person was actually part of the story maybe not but i wasn't sold and for some reason fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayal br br overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if once br br 8 10
<START> what a snore fest br br of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don't need a 'modern' update br br never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost br br also what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if he's not overweight
<START> un bleeping believable meg ryan doesn't even look her usual pert lovable self in this which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick hard to believe she was the producer on this dog plus kevin kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on whoosh banzai finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill must be a replay of jonestown hollywood style wooofff
<START> this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the 350 000 plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor al quida br br following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush cabal locks it down by googling up the very title as indicated in parenthesis br br god save our country this will not be done by following the christo fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november 2006
<START> vivacious irrepressible anne of green gables brings unlooked for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister brother on prince edward island br br lucy maud montgomery's well loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie excellent production values a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves br br taking her professional name from the character she portrayed actress anne shirley is a joy as the red headed fourteen year old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians completely assured in her starring role miss shirley is a delight entertaining the viewer with anne's boundless imagination quick temper and not so secret sorrows br br playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home helen westley also completely commands her role the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp tongued woman slowly unbend to anne's affection and child like innocence australian character actor o p heggie gives one of his finest performances as westley's shy gentle brother who welcomes anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station br br tom brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs anne's attention sara haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor charley grapewin makes the most of his few moments as avonlea's doctor
<START> it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraph long plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no avail this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didn't really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the white latino issue yes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist as for the maya character she didn't seem like a real person anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made
<START> excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore br br i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devine br br saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it
<START> i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input i know they're going for realism but to be frank i just don't want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life i'll uhm live tell me an interesting story and we'll talk i can deal with the low production values hell i'm a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously i'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walking to someplace rosetta working in a bakery rosetta eating a waffle rosetta carrying around bags of far rosetta walking back home rosetta walking someplace it's just not that entertaining there isn't really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it's just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess i'm supposed to love this but come on there's nothing in there
<START> erich rohmer's l'anglaise et le duc makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins' la commune paris 1871 both films screened at this year's toronto international film festival ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale ironic given the tragic events that were taking place in the u s during the festival br br set in paris during the french revolution the movie based on grace elliott's lucy russell memoirs is a first hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans played by jean claude dreyfus who in contrast to herself is a supporter of the revolution br br true to form you don't know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on one of the earliest of the french new wave filmmakers rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative after all in the midst of the rebelling youth viet nam days of the late 60s and 70s he was filming romantic little confections like claire's knee but don't sell the old boy short folks he's always been a student of human nature not an ideologue and l'anglaise et le duc continues to bear this out br br rohmer's characters are never the bad guys nor the good guys' they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities and limitations that's why his movies are always provocative and this film is no exception br br now for the technological nuts and bolts br br rohmer though making his way into his 80s is still on the cutting edge of cinematic innovation the look of l'anglaise is like something you've never seen before you guessed it the old guy like several of the festival's directors this year has gone digital br br all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s parisian settings as a matter of fact you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological and yes i'll say it political insights br br toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year as well as some of the world's oldest and the old masters are standing there on cinema's cutting edges right alongside the young ones br br long live youth long live old age and long live erich rohmer br br
<START> i'd give it a 2 10 br br i was really really disappointed br br the storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show br br others may point out that this is a 'kid's show' and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as mu lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation br br in conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on
<START> this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview jackie said it was his favorite as well it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well this movie was a favorite of brandon lee who used parts in rapid fire and was also lifted in tango and cash which used some of the opening scenes br br jackie plays a policeman in hong kong the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend played by maggie chung his job is to protect ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down but even that poses many problems jackie is at his absolute best here the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights all in all one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage br br all in all another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies by the end of this movie you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore jackie had to take responsibility himself there are no gimmicks wires or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general give yourself a treat and watch this movie it is truly sensational
