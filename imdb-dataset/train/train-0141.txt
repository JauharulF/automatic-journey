<START> what's written on the poster is at birth he was given 6 years to live at 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime ami is an american born israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one at age of 34 after the love toward his 22 years old care giver didn't go well he decided to come to the us to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live he wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weights 39 pounds why your guess is as good as mine even i have seen this film br br obviously it's courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago his doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history people with his disease won't live long what's the point of him showing up at old doctor's door for why is tracking down this old doctor in the us is a journey of his lifetime there are so many things we might be interested in ami's life how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger how can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others how did he out lived his doctor's prediction how does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature the movie told us none of that instead the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let ami to show up at his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive i thought it was a joke
<START> it has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first 30 40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone br br and yet the producers roberto angel salcedo calls him an actor but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting period the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing br br for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didn't and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i don't buy it br br but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work out br br maka
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> i was a fan of the book ever since third grade so of course i had watched the movie read the sequel and then watched the television show it was a good show in itself and now as an adult i still enjoy the show my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book the first time i saw it i was so disappointed that i turned it off but that's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book kind of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies i found the series wonderful it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going it is truly enjoyable clean and wonderful
<START> things to come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to everytown is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england appeasement was at its height wells' prediction was borne out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by sub par model work is most effective the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design the art director was the great william cameron menzies and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work margaretta scott is very seductive as the chief's mistress the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with 30s technology this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond massey's magnificent speech that concludes the film rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well massey's final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly share br br unfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film
<START> all right here's the deal if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed actually i probably blushed more than i laughed and if i wasn't literally blushing on the outside then i was blushing on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i suppose br br i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter if i were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old church going lady heads to the theater and has a heart attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well that's just something i don't need on my conscience br br so how raunchy is it hmm try about 100 times worse than the wedding crashers honestly my mom would've walked out during the first scene i feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect br br there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that's what i come to expect from the man judd apatow who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared i'm all for making fun of michael mcdonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money paul rudd proclaiming if i hear ya mo be there one more time i'll ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate br br and when we see a quick 3 second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo's word up i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it br br strangely enough despite the raunch there's an admirable moral to the story the movie doesn't portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin he's really portrayed as a likable admirable character sure he's a little weird after all he has a framed asia poster more videogames than an asian kid and a toy collection that features the million dollar man's boss but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin as odd as it may seem there's a bit of an it's ok to wait message br br but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go that was certainly apatow's intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly rogen and malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you'll love the movie br br i'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes i find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f word or fratboy sex discussions but that's me like i said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater i just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good idea br br there you go my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable
<START> caught this on ifc yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they're in love and she's so devastated over his death she doesn't go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better br br as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed please it's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill where's the guilt over poor gerald who gets puked on if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this movie
<START> it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie br br i've never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target br br everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening br br the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic br br if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option br br rating 9
<START> an interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus but done several times by now overall the movie is too long and drags a bit the editing could have been tighter i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits maybe the movie was rushed to market the lighting was too dark in places but the worst technical problem is the audio the level was good enough to hear the dialog but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them which is very distracting either they were not careful in the recording or the sound mixing could have been better also too much background noise got through the should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes the tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter br br also the acting was a bit flat i am sorry but when i see that the same person writes and stars in a movie in my experience it is a red flag br br but it was a good effort so i gave it a 4
<START> some thirty years ago author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi better known as herge the creator of tintin this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview while we listen to the cassettes herge died in 1983 and see some old photos and footage of the man himself some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife after he had an affair with one of his collaborators who years later would become his second wife an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books tintin in the congo tintin in the lands of the soviets to fairly anti imperialist books just a few years later the blue lotus on the whole i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater
<START> 'i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain ' this is an excell film it should have been re rated to pg 13 but anyways prince's first film and greatest the follow up sucked but i haven't seen for years so here's what i can remember about it the kid prince has to juggle with winning over the love of his life apollonia herself keeping his band together the revolution as themselves and the tension in his family but his rival band the time as themselves is ruining his life like morris himself is trying to steal apollonia from the kid just like saturday night fever flashdance and 8 mile really good rent it laugh and cry and if you luv it buy it
<START> i'll bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador hernando cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to mexico before taking on the aztecs good thing he did because he would never have known about those t rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods br br that was understandable what wasn't was the casting of blue eyed ian ziering as cortes even with the blond hair made famous in beverly hills 90210 dyed black ian looked positively ridiculous at least he made no attempt at a spanish accent br br the real hero of tyrannosaurus azteca is marco sanchez also late of a television series with a semi recurring role in walker texas ranger as detective sandoval of the dallas pd he finds true love with an aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it wasn't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship br br tyrannosaurus azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous sid marty krofft series the land of the lost all that was needed was some sleestak to appear br br if you're interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that didn't quite make the history books by all means check out tyrannosaurus azteca then try and sit through it with a straight face
<START> the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression
<START> they filmed this movie out on long island where i grew up my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water tasted disgusting and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form it never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as i knew was never released on video and i'm sure wasn't released on dvd yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way i can find it anywhere does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased and which format that would be
<START> and look how a true story with a little help of it's friends a welldone and touching script a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of no name actors especially from the 4 yr old jodelle ferland becomes a must seen movie 9 10
<START> this movie was released by roger corman so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with br br although some viewers may miss the subtleties in this movie because of the very typical obsessed killer type marketing approach there are unique differences about this movie br br amanda as played by the obviously talented justine priestley is a complex character some people like these movies precisely because the violence can seem random but here the ramifications of past abuse dealt with in a realistic but tasteful manner are what shape the psychosis of amanda surprisingly amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love where most of these movies turn into the typical all out fight to the death and the evil character dies just as evil in the end as to begin with br br some rough edges in this picture but i have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and yes originality as compared to the usual especially on a budget
<START> this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just don't know br br but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princess br br i was disappointed in this movie but don't forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself
<START> i know that this is an unpopular position concerning zabriskie point but i loved this film i know i know i can legitimately be called an antonioni fanatic i love l'avventura i love la notte i love l'eclisse i love red desert i love blowup and i love professione reporter aka the passenger the only antonioni film that i don't love the only one i've ever given less than an 8 10 and one of only three that i have given less than a 10 10 la notte and l'eclisse being the other two though i fully acknowledge that i have to see both of them again is beyond the clouds which can fairly be called an awful film however there is not better awful film if you catch my drift so if you're not an antonioni fan you should only logically ignore me if you are even a casual fan though and you are wondering whether this particular film whose name when spoken is often followed by br br a spit which is generally despised by even antonioni's admirers is at all worth seeing the answer is yes br br okay the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99 of film watchers care only for the narrative of a film well that's not exactly true if a film is amazing in a particular aspect say acting or cinematography or direction and just decent in its narrative film watchers might very well love it but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story that's another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years logic then they absolutely hate the film i will actually agree with that in some ways as much as i may dislike it and want to change my view it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative i perceive as poor however other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative this is certainly what must drive viewers away from zabriskie point i could relate the story to you but you probably would just think it was nonsensical it is actually but to me that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful i'd actually compare it favorably to 2001 which is my favorite film however 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film br br what zabriskie point has in spades is mood the music helps a lot the score includes a lot of acts of the day including pink floyd the mood is kind of similar to the moods of antonioni's other masterpieces filled with loneliness and desolation also the freedom that comes from that the best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman her name is daria i know but i don't remember his name pull over in their vehicle next to a historic marker on a desert highway there is beyond the stone wall that has been erected to keep cars from flying off an ancient lakebed it's basically a rocky desert and the two go to play in it the setting is enormously beautiful the woman says this is such a beautiful place what do you think the man i think it's dead there's no inclination to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing this is a lot like sentiments expressed in other antonioni films characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible instead of david locke the protagonist of the passenger fed up with journalism we have the young hippie sick of his friends' politics he thinks they talk too much and don't act out what they feel is right or at least he says he does it seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situation br br the film is also simply amazing visually antonioni's films are all identifiable by just a few frames but his visual style was always building i like the passenger more than i do zabriskie point but zabriskie point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect well that might sound odd l'avventura and red desert are amazing pictorially i think it's the camera movements that are particularly amazing here he obviously made a ton of money on blowup which was the biggest arthouse hit of its day the biggest ever at that point he spends it well here especially with his aerial shots one of the film's greatest sequences involves the man who has stolen a man's private airplane dive bombing daria in her car br br the one thing that can be fairly criticized is the film's politics they're certainly facile not that hippies were facile but that antonioni's vision of hippies there weren't any in italy of course are bizarre and well filtered through a foreigner's eyes there's a rather childish criticism of advertising but it's a criticism that still exists today i say can't you people just ignore it what does it hurt are you walking around buying things you don't want because of billboards or there is also the criticism against capitalism daria a secretary works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves in order to make cheap suburban homes for families rod taylor a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in the time machine and the birds plays her boss the ending which i won't ruin you've got to see it is almost offensively cheap i can though understand the treatment of police officers not that i disdain them generally but they were awful at the time they can still be awful now they've always had too much power br br these trite arguments against the american way of life still don't effect my opinion of the film much i find this filtered view of america extremely interesting i really don't think a hippie would have disagreed with antonioni 10 10
<START> i noticed fire was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn't recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in '85 twenty years later the film is still awful besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them and to compound this musical assault rob lowe's character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo all the characters were intensely unappealing although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them actually i thought mare winningham was appealing and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon
<START> no message no symbolism no dark undercurrents just a wonderful melange of music nostalgia and good fun put to gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it it's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios of course anything with the incomparable judi dench is worth watching and cleo laine's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus this lady is in the same league as the late ella this goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime i feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle just a wonderful film
