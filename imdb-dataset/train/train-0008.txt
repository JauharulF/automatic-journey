<START> pathetic worse than a bad made for tv movie i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boy's girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable br br i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
<START> aaron spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film it plays like a probable failed series pilot br br handsome clint walker is u s marshal dave harmon who wanders into yuma arizona territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive br br walker takes the other brother to jail walker also meets a cute homeless mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse one night andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him pinning the murder on walker not good for your first twenty four hours on the job walker visits the local army fort and rankles the chains of the commander the bigwig hears of his brothers' deaths and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well the local native population who get short changed by the army on their beef also get rankled in the chains area with all these chains getting rankled walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner the army guy involved in the murder ends up dead the local cattle buyer is implicated the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along br br there is a semi subplot involving the death of walker's family at the hands of army raiders and i think this would have been the force behind the series had it been picked up instead the film ends abruptly and i kept waiting for scenes from next week's exciting episode because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits br br walker is handsome rugged and has a voice deeper than a well the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies much of the action is pretty lame and the violence is tepid the first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso and falls without a scratch on him i did not expect reservoir dogs but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns speaking of children the mexican kid here goes from cute to aneurysm inducing annoyance very quickly br br if you dislike westerns then you will dislike yuma if you like westerns then you will still dislike yuma i cannot recommend it br br this is unrated but contains physical violence and gun violence br br
<START> i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art i thought would be fun and yes bad prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box i sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind fortunately i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair we see lane smith as a guard tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re opening the old prison then we see the new warden lane smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years well the rest follows suit prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid tom everett tiny lister and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters chelsea field is okay as the female lead the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick an underrated character actor as cresus a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric the film has a tense taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes there are a few excessively shot gore scenes the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes but these scenes are visually creative and interesting the acting is uniformly decent the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is give prison a break get it
<START> i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas coffee phone play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid i think i'm done never mind i'm still not done what is this a joke why do we have to go all the way to line ten really what's the point of it i will just right random words for now maple story is fun i love my friends
<START> this film was so disappointing from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love why is it called this i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time in the end the effect was listless br br i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasn't the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters you might say it was mysterious but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere br br the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child the film has very little context for the time place or character i am not a prude but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover this film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving lulu's mother seem a bit boring br br the nail filing actually made more sense as it did give some indication of lulu's emotional state i will not fault the actors as i don't they had a lot to work on br br i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull br br i can't be bothered talking about it anymore
<START> return to the lost world was filmed back to back with the 1992 version of the lost world br br in this sequel the same five people lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land gomez has something to do with this they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved much to the delight of the natives br br like in the lost world what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t rex and ankylosaurus br br john ryhs davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back br br despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs i enjoyed return to the lost world br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> it's a bad season for bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office london dreams is no exception to that let's dissect it it's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it sounds impressive right but unfortunately the film is not br br arjun ajay devgan is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday his dream is to perform in wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90 000 audience calling out his name he is joined by two brothers zoheb wasim debutants aditya roy ranvijay and a ravishing priya asin together they form london dreams their dream band after impressing the chief of a record company they become overnight sensations arjun is secretly in love with priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal arjun then brings his childhood friend manjit khosla aka mannu salman khan a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life to join their band mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later arjun become envious for mannu's superior skills and his affair with priya arjun with the help of zoheb plans to blight mannu what happens next forms the rest of the movies br br coming to the technical aspects we feel only the shadow of vipul amritlal sha whom we have admired in namaste london felt like he simply visualized the screenplay to cut it short a glorified cameraman screenplay by suresh nair dulls even though it has its moments defined in a predictable fashion the screenplay bore you to stiff camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of london it's the only entertaining part while watching songs br br few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character salman is monotonous and he irks you asin is forgettable and i don't that she will make it big in bollywood aditya roy is impressive while ranvijay is strictly ok brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings i don't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task br br finally let me put it simple and straight london dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on dvd
<START> people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs congo king kong vs godzilla king kong 1976 they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female br br the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kong and archeologists have been fascinated it at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it br br this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on elvira's mistress of the dark shows in the early 1980's it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around 1 00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like br br gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere br br vote 7 and half out of 10
<START> alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie as for 1999 i feel that one of the top five films was cruel intentions it had everything a great movie should have except for an original story being adapted from a novel it was still damn good on to cruel intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep which must not have happened actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director roger kumble did this one also well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed it starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter's naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked this would have been alright if the lady was not like 50 and basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was but you can not do that with a movie this actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1 but with sebastian being more or less just a prankster and kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story this movie had no foundation to it whoever did the casting on this thing was way off they could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors i am using this term although i dont know why they for sure didnt do any in this movie br br all this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1 another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used as if to show why the kids are like this it didnt work though the best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world the on screen tension that was there made the film what it was this thing really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this
<START> going into this i was expecting anything really good but after the damage this inflexed on me i'm just happy to think strait it's hard to think what the film makers ha this was a good movie the stories and i use the world loosely are incoherent and do make any sense at all there just stupid things that happen at random the acting if can be called acting is horrible i've seen batter acting in toy ads i know it's a low budget video bin garbages but still even it's not like they tried will after stetting thought it i feel very sleepy and still yawws do i'm going to go lie down br br warnning do not atemp to drive walk read or do any after watching chillers other side affectts may enguled lose of any or all metal funkions
<START> kurt russell whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world's fair will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter there are times you feel that you're watching elvis until something snaps you back to reality perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen all the performances here are excellent season hubley as priscilla pat hingle as the colonel even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma presley br br kurt's dad bing is here playing elvis' father vernon and there's a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis' buddy and bodyguard red west br br a must see for rock n roll fans
<START> i get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon disney and the like it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again when my daughters couldn't go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different i flipped the channels my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey's voice i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice over work for a little duck well i couldn't change the channel my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed it's not necessarily a proponent for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent you name it kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience my girls already accept others as they are and don't pick on others for being different my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they're picked on one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her br br so those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it's an advocate for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon br br and if you need it explained to you well you need more help than any television show could ever offer
<START> a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism setting the story around the famous book of kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona off the western coast of scotland br br telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom cruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology in hopes of recovering a lost artefact br br the films true beauty lies in its' animation cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series 'samurai jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion br br the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic revivalist mysticism the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland br br the secret of kels is an absolute treat for all genders all ages it's a lovely piece of family cinema br br don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed
<START> i never wanted to see this film then one day for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was my preconceptions were confirmed br br for starters i'd like to question the politics of the film it hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills these women are nothing more the whores are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful this is not the only right wing message of the film there are hundreds of shots of american flags and huge wads of cash a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film money is depicted as the only important thing to young people br br the manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs br br and finally why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend is her father always involved we watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father she 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend i find this most strange br br in conclusion this film is immoral fascistic degrading to women and frankly disturbing but what else do you expect from jerry bruckhiemer
<START> i loved watching ''sea hunt '' back in the day i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4 30 would be ready to watch ''sea hunt '' and mike nelson in his underwater adventures i loved it he took to you a place not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea pre ''thunderball '' or even before cousteau became common there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show underwater photography also progressed the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show watch and enjoy
<START> first things first the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed now actress wang zu xian the one who played xiao qian in the movie is 42 years old and well aged it's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old school hongkong productions like this br br the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not scaring but only fun br br i had the experience of translating the second script of a chinese ghotst story and i thought that script was a decent write however when i saw the movie i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles however it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining br br if you have seen the lord of the rings you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch it's definitely a laugh out loud bravo
<START> an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom the producer hires some one to go and bring her back complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking god who likes to eat naked women br br this is a gory sleazy movie there is copious amounts of nudity and violence not to mention violence against nude people its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic lets face it despite the gore the nasty sex and abuse and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer the pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other even though its ultimately all one story worst of all almost no one says anything most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that i'll do what i want its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims i'd recommend this as a sleep aide br br this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep or unless you need to see every euro cannibal movie br br an aside videoasia just released this as part of their terror tales series their print is oddly letter boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a japanese source there is fogging that was cropped to remove the subtitles their print also has no opening titles
<START> set in japan ashura is the story of demons taking over the earth the premise is far more complicated but the arching storyline should not be forgotten japan is in turmoil with demons occupying human form roaming the lands generally speaking demons look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of 'ogre' which is a mythological creature of some historic stature we're talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child eating monsters br br however in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress in order to save the world from demons there are demon slayers trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the passage way between the realm of hell and that of the real world these are the basic premises br br the story begins with a festival in a local town amid these festivities 3 men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing harm the villagers run excepting those which are demonic in nature who turn green eyed and try to kill them the demon slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons from here the story gets interesting the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune telling demon appears before the 3 gate keepers revealing the arrival of ashura with it comes the end of the reign of man and begins the reign of demons ashura however requires some form of birthing process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which won't be revealed to you until you see the film the 3 demon slayers are a wise old man a powerful yet unprincipled man and a skilled and compassionate warrior immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with she in turn is a brigand who is good natured sought after by authorities when the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her shoulder and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder needless to say the mark is not a good sign what ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itself br br the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would i came in thinking it would either be a fast paced action style film with demons or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in ringu and ju on i was however mistaken in the best possible way the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play and it plays itself out as such combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away br br the film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera work comparable to many great samurai films of our days but adding to it a well thought and classical plot with great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my book br br that being said it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone its not cheap thrills horror its not balls to the wall action its a horror style play thats been filmed it has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional one liners like japanese plays the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something else br br overall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you riveted and amused it has good writing good acting and good direction it is all in all a solidly great film
<START> this is a really good film and one that i've enjoyed watching several times michael caine's awesome as always michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney from the start it's so well written who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemary's baby could write something this witty let's face it michael caine chris reeve dyan cannon henry jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumet br br i'm really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime just watch it and adore it
<START> steve carell plays dan burns newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls at a large family homecoming dan meets his perfect woman only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother br br what's a man to do br br i rather liked dan in real life but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful if you cannot accept it fear not get smart will be along later in the year but for the record i thought he was very good br br dan in real life starts off like your typical incidentally amusing family drama but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and carell's frustration with his situation grows it's not massively original but if you only saw movies with original ideas cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed wouldn't they but dan in real life is entertaining and a good cast who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love br br i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again
