<START> i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia the movie never really gets through to the person his thoughts and feelings what they did was to collect the little material that they had shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say oh he was such an inspiration to all of us like bono or johnny depp whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him br br sure being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes br br go see the movie if you are a fan otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound
<START> jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy and we love him for it he has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala ace ventura and turn them into decent comedic outings or in the case of 'liar liar' make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas he was excellent in both 'man on the moon' and 'the truman show ' the guy is remarkable br br then comes 'bruce almighty ' an ideal vehicle for carrey and a premise that should have worked carrey after complaining about god and how his life stinks is enabled with god's powers however the script is pure recycled garbage now no matter how bad a script is carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects only some of which are amusing carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless he seems more like a 5 year yearning for our attention wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny when it's really just annoying br br i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on 'friends' and she was superb in last year's 'the good girl ' she too has a gift for comedy but with the script as linear as it is she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend she comes across as nagging grumpy and there is no chemistry between the two stars br br 'bruce almighty' should have been a comedy that works but it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of religion a few minor giggles his internet is yehweh but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy handed and even black comedy at times the movie fails on nearly every level that's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs but it's close any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems but hey if you find pee jokes funny go for it br br
<START> no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didn't quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the 5 cent baby attached to a fish pole hahaha well yes i don't think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what they had the guts and entrails were actually very convincing the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability very good for a laugh
<START> not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the 80's but not for the 21st century
<START> back in the day of the big studio system the darndest casting decisions were made good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner had i been casting the film the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan br br margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen he did four films with her but is only this one where neither of them dies sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york in fact sullavan's husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then br br i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non americans in mutiny on the bounty stewart in the mortal storm was german but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out br br but if you can accept stewart than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch the plot is pretty simple a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don't get along in person but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife br br though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions he makes himself very scarce br br and joseph schildkraut who is always good is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan you really hate people like that i've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day sad that it pays off a good deal of the time
<START> lame lame lame a 90 minute cringe fest that's 89 minutes too long a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue that's straining oh so hard to be hip mostly it's just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat a sample of this movie's dialogue after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante characterÂshe any questions ' hyuck hyuck hyuck bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the director's watched the evil dead' way too many times br br i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back what a turd
<START> i had watched this film from ralph bakshi wizards hey good lookin' one night ago on www afrovideo org and i didn't see anything racial i am not stupid i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today but i think it's a satire and a very very urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to the tar baby and the briar patch these aren't bigoted stories mind you but cultural icons created by black americans and me being a white woman read and love those stories and i also found it an interesting time capsule view on the black culture in harlem new york in the 70's br br well to get to the nitty gritty of this film this film is a live action animated film which begins in live action with a fellow named sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem you know to me rabbit bear and fox are animal versions of randy sampson and the preacherman an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s Â racial ethnic and otherwise br br so anyway it is another good bakshi movie and should we sweep films like this under the rug pretend they never exist hmmm i think that would be a shame i think we should watch these films entacted and learn about what goes on back then just how far we come since then
<START> this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere it's raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various orbits br br this show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limited length series of uniformly high quality
<START> after watching this i had lost a little respect for christopher lee this has passed over time this film was utter garbage first they tried to recreate the ending from the first howling with incredibly bad make up then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film from the look of it it was supposed to be dee wallace stone teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves lead by sybil danning who seems to be naked all the time br br this is not even worth renting unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity try to catch it on cable instead it would be so chopped up it may actually make sense
<START> this is a great story of family loyalty which thankfully doesn't resort to the usual tricks or at least the ones i'm used to seeing in american and european films of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension br br it's very watchable and very lovable it has some beautiful cinematography but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain
<START> a lot of death happens in the wild you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film br br and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing money br br then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible it was surreal it's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat br br if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually copulating giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other socializing playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors like mouth brooding migration problem solving skills culture yes many animal species have what humans call culture communication skills parenting healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well rounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead
<START> purple rain is a great film if you are a 40 something music lover who partied to prince music in the 1980s the story is a much used formula rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self respect prince is a bad actor but his performance especially of purple rain i would die 4 u make it worth sitting through the film he is himself and as a showman as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson circa thriller apollonia kotero a former prince protÃ©gÃ© is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince but her script doesn't let her far morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements
<START> the character of tarzan has been subjected to so many clichÃ©s and so many bad interpretations that those who are hoping for a different kind of version people like me i mean who liked the tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little ought to know how the recent renditions stack up some of the imdb reviews address this point but here's my 02 br br i am aware of only two count 'em cinema depictions of tarzan namely greystoke with christopher lambert and the disney animated version that try to depict edgar rice burrough's rather interesting character the son of a marooned english noble couple picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves and who becomes lord of the jungle because of his superior human intellect before making it back to england and claiming his other identity rather than the usual hollywood jungle man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell his mysterious inability to speak proper english despite long exposure to people who know the language his habit of swinging on vines his strength heroism etc about the only thing these two characters have in common are the name tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named jane ron ely's tv version is something of a compromise like burroughs' character he speaks good english and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of jamesbondish way but he's no lord greystoke and there's no jane br br well this film is in a third category of tarzan films and i hope it remains a category of one because it's awful this category uses the character as a vehicle for of all things soft porn jane played by legendarily bad actress bo derek is in africa looking for her dad the absent minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time she finds him effortlessly richard harris as the dad is the best thing here he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of peter o'toole's deliberately silly performance in what's new pussycat dad explains the legend of tarzan some sort of ghost or spirit he says either a steal from or an inartistic attempt at homage to king kong to his daughter who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape man shortly afterward we hear the infamous clichÃ© of the tarzan yell dad dies which oddly doesn't seem to faze his devoted daughter very much and then br br then tarzan appears but says nothing indeed he says nothing during the entire film he and jane fall in love and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love poetry off screen the end that's the plot br br well not exactly there's also a scene where tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor a most unusual boa since it's the only poisonous one ever seen jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with i'm not making this up and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off br br i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive but this time it's hard let's see well it's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan even though we all know orangutans don't live in africa after all the classic tarzan movies all used indian elephants did they not also you have to admit that bo derek is pretty in face and form but in that case why the hell didn't she just make a career as an art model what does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman i actually haven't decided whether it's a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch but now i realize try as i may i can't end on a positive note br br see this film if you're a bad film buff i'm outa here
<START> and a self admitted one to boot at one point the doctor's assistant refers to himself as igor br br working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions this movie doesn't spend enough time exploring the premise most of the screen time is split between girlfriend in a coma domestic strife and chasing down the brain donor's killer it attempts to be a sci fi drama thriller but fails to deliver on any of the three br br as a frankenstein remake this one is missing everything that made the original good nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital the transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen isn't even shown when the experiment works there is no praise and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction br br any suspense over who the killer might be is shattered by progressively showing him in the same room with all of the possible suspects finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and interviewing one person br br san francisco as a setting is both overplayed and underused the opening sequence hammers home the point that this is happening in sf a cable car plays a significant role the leads live in a hilltop victorian pier 39 makes an appearance and the final showdown happens at golden gate park more specifically along ten feet of cliff side at the park just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times once the obvious scenery bases are rounded no other attempt is made to explore the city br br the acting is the only saving grace here keir dullea shows a good range and pulls off a couple of genuinely emotional scenes suzanna love portrays recovery from a coma well tony curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many evil guy stares with most of the frankenscience explained away by his assistant the little blond kid hits his cues fairly well also br br i also gave it one extra star for the scene where the husband drives south from the bridge it cuts to a u turn in an unrelated parking lot and then he's instantly back on the bridge driving north it takes a whole lot of something bravery ignorance deadlines to try and slip that one by the viewer during the one single car chase
<START> i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 br br the final episode of the 10th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killed off in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief br br from the extremely rushed end of the series it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg 1 franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves br br unless the asgard return in a future sg 1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends br br poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series
<START> man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy now most of the rest of the film was okay it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others the problem isn't with direction acting or anything technical the movie is just destroyed in the third act why the murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history for all the complaints about burton's planet of the apes the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever what a let down
<START> i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it it was one of worst movies i've ever seen i'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie i would probably never talk to them again anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry hermit type personality i'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too just like the self centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie i know everyone has different types of humor some people may not even like mine but that's okay i don't think this covers any range of humor though this movie is as flat and dull as wes anderson's mind go in and get ready to walk out it's best to get your money back too
<START> when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12 and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments br br it was always one of my favourite programmes the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom 'bewitched' but this time the character was cooler i always liked sabrina because she was smart she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch the characters at the beginning were great harvey jenny libby the quizmaster salem and mr poole my personal fave shame he left so early on hilda and zelda her aunts started off ok but then became irritating br br i liked mr kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering sabrina's secret what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable too many characters came and left such as valerie dreama and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me br br sabrina became self absorbed at college there was less magic no spell book no aunts living with her and roxie miles and morgan were annoying br br the last series was boring and i only watched to see what happened in the end not having hilda and zelda seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that the last episode made me feel a lot better though spoiler having sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to dullard aaron was great overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows magical
<START> i was so disappointed in this movie i don't know much about the true story so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination well somewhere the screenplay failed them it was so scattered is this movie about his childhood his love life his own disability his speaking ability his passion for the disabled i'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story but this movie wasn't it i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities but because of their personalities other small gripes 1 the heavy handed soundtrack it's the seventies we get it already 2 if he's such a phenomenal public speaker why weren't we treated to more than a snippet here and there and even then mostly in montages
<START> her cardboard lover is norma shearer's last movie she quit the movies and i think joined the board of directors at mgm that was a good move on her part her cardboard lover was talky and boring in parts it was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat br br the story was a good idea about a wealthy woman norma shearer hiring a man robert taylor to make her playboy fiancee george sanders jealous i am surprised that the director george cukor did not cut many of the talky scenes between ms shearer and mr taylor mr cukor served ms shearer well in the women but not in this movie br br the best performance in the movie was given by robert taylor during mr taylor's career he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and when ladies meet in 1941 in 1942 he gave his best comedy performance in her cardboard lover and up to then his best dramatic performance in johnny eager he had a busy year i think of all the actors at mgm mr taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot also mgm gave mr taylor all types of movies to make most of them were successful that is why mgm kept him for 25 years br br mr george sanders was very good as a socialite heel he played a similar role eight years later in all about eve for which he won an oscar for a supporting role as for ms shearer this was one of her worst performances she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy it is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 the women and gave her best performance it was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in her cardboard lover also it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful br br too bad she and mr taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together the superb escape the same comments about this movie can be said of another movie personal property that mr taylor made in 1937 with jean harlow it was too talky boring and the actress looked old ms harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor so in 1937 she died at age 26 what a waste she was becoming a good actress and getting better roles
