<START> baseketball is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen it is an off the wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and trey parker they play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to psyche out other members of the opposing team there is no rule about what is not allowed so naturally they do the craziest things possible one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking wow this this over already another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak who is a hyped up little guy baseketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines and it is very fun to watch
<START> the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street yes it has comedy essence about it so has all the other films but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny and freddy also plays comic mind games with them which in its own way is very disturbing by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly frighten his victims this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way don't fall asleep
<START> but i've seen better too br br the story here is predictable a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred three guesses what happens this isn't a total bomb the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances it's reasonably well made for a low budget film just don't expect any nudity swearing blood or gore the film has a very mild pg rating i was never totally bored it's ok viewing on a quiet night i saw it on video it was a horrible print very dark and some scenes were impossible to see still i didn't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard worth seeing but only if you're a horror film completest
<START> an expedition led by hunky captain storm mark dana travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition they meet beautiful mysterious simira ziva rodann who joins them they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy and only simira seems to know what's going on br br a real snoozer i caught this on late night tv when i was about 10 it put me to sleep seeing it again all these years later i can see why it's slow moving the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in and this is only 66 minutes long the acting ranges from bad dana to real bad george n neise and there's no violence or blood to be found this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics involving a silly love triangle than horror br br this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good everyone plays it straight there's some good acting from diane brewster it's short and the mummy attack scenes all three of them aren't bad they're not scary just mildly creepy still this movie is pretty bad a sure fire cure for insomnia
<START> this infamous ending to koen wauters' career came to my attention through the 'night of bad taste' judging by the comment index i wasn't the first and i am not to be the last person in western europe to learn that this musician undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene even the dutch agree on that tried to be an actor whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged br br in 'intensive care' he's quite likable but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating no one can blame him it deserves its ranking in verheyen's hall of fame by all means standards the story of the murderous maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and wrathful has been told dozens of times before and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography br br ic contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses the pace is dull the tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them the sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing the couple from amsterdamned could have made it work though while dealing with the couple subject the whole subplot between wauters and the girl does not work a more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims to be who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse i will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces as a matter of fact most of them do the ones i recall where obvious for the genre a pretty nurse and two cops br br hence in a slasher the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself the anti hero has to take out the villain mostly through clever thinking for former red berets don't often get parts in these films they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer translated to the events wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress br br no people i am not finished this is not how the story goes wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to a clockwork orange so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains though this method ensures the killer's death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets the doctor survives in order to enable ic to reach the 80 min mark br br i should have made my point by now intensive care is a bad movie which can only be enjoyed by bad taste lovers who can verify verheyen's catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it for example the unintended parody value of the doctor's clown mask halloween and the final confrontation in the park the chase at the end of friday the 13th br br however let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give ic a little credit george kennedy is not one of them all he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor french actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand in he could have played his naked gun part again to end up as beef but with a longer screen time the finale may be one of them i had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence it is good for a laugh br br name one good truly point about intensive care koen wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career it makes me wonder how many editions of the paris dakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses br br
<START> i found 'time at the top' an entertaining and stimulating experience the acting while not generally brilliant was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic it is certainly one of the better works in the genre children's sci fi normally i would say that canada the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children and 'time at the top' does nothing to discount this theory i don't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them both are in abundance in this film the special effects are good without detracting from the story or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations it would have been very easy to inject an over load of sfx in this film but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre' br br the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy overall this film is highly satisfactory and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes or those that try to like myself now i really must read the original book as soon as possible
<START> i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you'll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring
<START> if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer it comes across as decidedly average br br a journalist duchovny travels across country to california to document america's most famous murderers unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions pitt is a serial killer himself br br rather predictable throughout this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well but i'd not bother to see it again
<START> the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this it's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
<START> i was not entirely impressed by this film it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it it was very slow and what was with picking robocop peter weller as one of the main actors that was a sad point br br all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out
<START> i rented this horrible movie the worst think i have ever seen i believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones nothing scary except i paid 1 50 to rent it and that was 1 49 too much the acting is horrible the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash the slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a b movied look like an oscar candidate all i can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick i would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
<START> i found horrorvision almost unwatchable while only 70 minutes in length i still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again the acting was of the if i scream and say k a lot i'm intense' school and the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out br br while i never go to full moon for great film making i have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this
<START> i'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director eduardo sanchez who helmed the wildly popular and successful blair witch project besides this is an alien movie of sorts and sounded something like stephen king's dreamcatchers one of those movies that the critics hated but i enjoyed br br but nope unfortunately i felt that for the most parts altered is a waste of time so i shall keep this review short premises are always promising and altered's no different it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices so i shall not go into details but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable and something you'd like to forget br br what if you're given a chance for revenge that is you manage to successfully hunt down and capture one alive what will you do for this group it's a gleeful payback time or so they thought and this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest with bad uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting even if it's low budgeted there aren't many redeeming factors be it strength of storyline or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting it's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed br br what's good though is the makeup much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i shan't mention because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable other than that there are the usual cheap special effects blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before br br watch this only as a last resort compared to the other monster movie in town feast this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously bogged down by an uninspiring direction you've been warned
<START> if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability you'll love this film otherwise you'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget br br in the previews for the film many scenes were shown which were not in the film and within the film some scenes just don't make sense while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half i can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the credits br br
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 13 it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a dichotomy on the one side beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision on the other two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil br br this all makes for a great film story but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'
<START> my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twenty two when she made elephant walk remember i'm nine so the feelings aren't sexual i just couldn't see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she's almost seventy four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived br br i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylor's beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature br br all in all a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video
<START> a young woman jean simmons is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt sonia dresdel and uncle barry jones that she's losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible the only other person she sees is the estate caretaker a lascivious character played by maxwell reed whose caught the wayward eye of the middle aged aunt all of this the aunt and the caretaker the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him and the susceptible niece in the middle would have made for a darker and more sinister film as it is a frame up for a murder sends trevor howard a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies and simmons across the countryside escaping police catching headlines of police net closing in over her front page photo hopping on buses and winding up in liverpool where they meet some wonderfully cast characters and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle
<START> richard farnsworth is one of my favorite actors he usually gives solid performances such as in the straight story and the grey fox he also does fairly well here but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget poor writing and so so photography the miller movie formula gives it a 4 richard gets a 5
<START> wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow cher who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with danny aiello until she falls for his headstrong angry brother nicholas cage the script is sharp with plenty of great lines the acting is wonderful the accents i've been told are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful new york has never looked so good on the screen a must see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis they're both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got a beautiful funny film a must see
<START> this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli specifically other great films include my neighbor totoro and kikki's delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride br br why is this film so good because it's a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compelling br br most japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those trench coat wearing posers there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderful br br the voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads pazo james van der beek and sheeta anna paquin the sound engineering is great too use your studio sound if you've got it br br one aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e g gruff general silly sidekick kooky old miner etc highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60
