<START> repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight br br one of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom i don't understand why they'd cut that the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie br br ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv and completely not needed or helpful to a movie speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used it's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away br br another movie with jerry springer in it that should've told me not to watch it from the preview br br a popular movie for the in crowd
<START> war inc corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wet work against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense there's no reason or method to the madness br br it's considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank i e war is more or less a knock off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not it's all quirky often bordering on bizarre war inc's not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart we're supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war br br john cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isn't a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again pathetic br br it's not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c
<START> one of the first ova's original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a cyberpunk sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near future pollution in a dystopian society br br the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we can't beat crime we'll get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons br br equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his hench wo men the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time br br the animation is not state of the art but it's very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion br br the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that br br anyway dominion tank police is great it's japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended
<START> i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod if you don't expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you won't be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' suzanna arquette who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter br br mandy's face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete 5 alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness a perfect 7 to 10 ratio of waist to hips and splendidly configured legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio br br and no flat butt to boot which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle lit hot tub with her blindfolded german guy victim no 2 but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it br br mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no 2 who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason br br mandy's uber nordic facial features coupled with her uber voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i don't know if they would go for her type but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground br br vambo drule
<START> the only word i can think of to describe this movie is ordinary br br the plot line about gary sinise's character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c'mon living as some sort salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn't handle life in the lucrative pro am golf community cry me a river i wish these were my problems i do enjoy dylan baker and sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for sinise the scene in which little timmy price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
<START> this story was never among my favourites in christie's works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more cosmopolitan bunch perhaps the revised thirties setting didn't allow for that i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because i've not long re read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on br br humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode though i did smile at the 'lemon sole' throwaway line altogether though a solid entry in the series though not one of the best
<START> if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so insultingly poor i can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable br br there's no plot and the non plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking the people don't react act or in any way resemble human beings the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be the whole thing is one pointless mess it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much br br i could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before it's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time br br honestly the very worst movie of all time you'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10 10 and urge you to buy the dvd i can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film it's terrible br br 0 10 and that's generous
<START> i enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called roxy especially at christmas time because there also appears a mc santa claus br br even if this is an old film and even if i have videotaped it from tv when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen i went there to check it out it's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv br br even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the money's worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video
<START> next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub genre while slasher films had 'black christmas' and 'halloween' to get the whole thing going zombie flicks had george romero's 'dead' films and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series other directors wanted to cash in a lot of italian directors were especially interested such as lucio fulci who brought us 'zombie' a year after romero's 'dawn of the dead' known as 'zombi' in italy and some other countries and it was there that fulci's film was known as 'zombi 2' apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero's film but is a good film in it's own right it was a big success in europe and 9 years later a sequel was born br br pros lots of beautiful lush scenery awesome score the acting isn't exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience after kind of a slow start the pace moves along like that of an action flick plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers good job on the make up effects lots of blood and some decent gore br br cons virtually plot less nothing you haven't already seen before blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of 'return of the living dead' films cardboard characters hasn't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music not that i'm saying all rock music of that period is bad clothing and overall feel of the movie br br final thoughts first of all this is not a true sequel to fulci's cult classic in fact i don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off for those that don't know fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei mattei's films are pretty laughable but like this film many are good campy fun and that's all this film really is just something to watch for fun br br my rating 3 5 5 so bad it's good rating 2 5 serious rating
<START> i'm no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch adults and children could watch it together how unusual my aunt liked it too it had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors and a talking parrot it reminded me of a favourite the wizard of oz the hero paulie an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures temptations and disappointments always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend marie highly recommended
<START> seeing this movie as i just did for the first time on turner classic which lists it as dangerous female can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogart astor version ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will they made him the actor he was the women are all good but no better than that well una merkel is a little better more interesting are the original joel cairo and mr gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles peter lorre and sydney greenstreet humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake here sam spade and ruth wonderley can't br br this movie doesn't exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 falcon don't just happen on the 1 to 10 scale i rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players
<START> this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker this one would have sprung from that it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's poor script writing and filming br br the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advice don't watch it
<START> the first two thirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting betty as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol comes across as a pleasant girl next door type who saw nothing wrong with what she did and there certainly wasn't anything wrong with it director mary harron who also made i shot andy warhol and american psycho recreates betty's america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new degraded black and white footage once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny yeager color is introduced betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw lili taylor in a great performance and chris bauer as well as john willie jared harris the scenes where harron recreates betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed the early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world because the film's third act is virtually non existent we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama flaws aside it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon
<START> okay first of all i didn't sit down to watch the premier of a star trek series to see a cowboy flying around in space this is how a normal enterprise episode works br br 1 archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship br br 2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged br br in all of the episodes i have seen all of the problems are happening because of archer's stupid mistakes oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t'pol kissing i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off come on this is star trek br br also what was with the banana slug in one episode hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason okay fine little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leave in a desert how dumb are these writers br br any ways just saying if enterprise is on don't watch it
<START> i had the pleasure of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival this film had caught my attention a little while back when i stumbled across an article about it in jalouse magazine seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting anyhow i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out all i can say is that i was speechless when the ending credits began to roll this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that i have seen in some time the photography art direction acting and especially directing were seamless and impeccable nothing is 'spelled out' for you in this film and actually makes you think something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite the dialogue is carefully crafted and although this script is not wall to wall chatter the characters words are very deliberate and meaningful br br it's definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it the more things you notice it's a very layered and intelligent film not sure when or where it's playing again but a definite must see for film enthusiasts
<START> i often wonder why this series was slammed so much i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued sally phillips simon pegg peter serafinowicz and not least julian rhind tutt of the hugely successful green wing the writers graham linehan and arthur matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn't be capable of writing something not worthy of publication if it is ever issued i will certainly buy it
<START> very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best or was that the purpose of the film to portray some smooth talking cold hearted new york city folks no romance here no comedy either acting is very flat and a very predictable plot what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies man can't you see that the more you quote the less significant your own movie becomes try to be original yourself a small budget is no excuse at all first time director neither crappy crappy crappy no wonder it only cost me one buck
<START> rather well done actually attack the evil villains in their lair stop a little big horn style ambush save the day via the waterboys' bugling works for me stiff upper british lip and all that br br so how does it play on a dvd 66 years later struck me as being like a western subbing apaches or sioux for the thugs and the us cavalry for the imperial british army it's very colonial in it's outlook you know white man's burden and all that kipling certainly would have approved br br cary grant fairbanks and maclaglen play it as broadly as possible putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor very short none of them were aiming for an oscar here in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes but sod it it still works and where else would ben casey wind up as an indian bugler only in hollywood br br def check this out if you like adventure and pseudo western style antics it was done by a bunch of pros well i might add br br outta
<START> a young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained brooklyn apartment building its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way the previous one john carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fiancÃ© so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing
<START> a tour deforce ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot it is a masterful fagan never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you hate him from start to finish bill sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie oliver reed was masterful his wife directed this masterpiece i went and saw his last movie gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the headliners the music fits the times and the mood who will buy this beautiful movie you should
