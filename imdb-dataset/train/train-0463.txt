<START> this interesting feature has a very fine story line rather colorful characters and a very steady pace it also incorporates a plot device from reap the wild wind and since cecil b deille directed that and his son in law anbthony quinn directed this film from his preparations that can hardly be a coincidence it works in both cases i must report the unusual set up tells the viewer that barataria an island ruled by jean lafitte is built upon piracy but during the war of 1812 and before he has always refrained from bothering united states' vessels now general andrew jackson has been charged with defending nearby new orleans with only 12 000 men against 60 000 british imperial redcoats and 60 ships lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger force he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a strategic landing spot to the u s forces there are other factors at work in the story line pirate bonnie brown and her father want to attack u s ships and do so in defiance of lafitte's orders leaving a boy alive without knowing they have missed an eyewitness when his testimony finally comes out jackson cannot grant what lafitte asks but lafitte supports him anyway and in the fog the pirates and jackson rout the british and he sails away to whatever destiny awaits a man who had genius and statesmanship but not fortune the cast of this colorful and physically lovely film are skilled indeed yul brynner has one of his best roles as the pirate king inger stevens is beautiful as the girl he loves charles boyer has many good lines as his adviser powerful lorne greene is a rival e g marshall the governor and claire bloom is charismatic as bonnie brown others in the cast include ted de corsia douglass dumbrille george mathews henry hull as jackson's adviser bruce gordon onslow stevens robert f simon henry brandon fran jeffries and leslie bradley among others the music by elmer bernstein is very memorable and the 1938 script remade here had only to be freshened a bit the shiny cinematography was the work of veteran loyal griggs the set decoration was supplied by albert nozaki hal pereira and walter tyler with set decoration by sam comer and roy moyer and costumes by edith head john jensen and ralph jester nellie manley did the elaborate hairstyles and wally westmore the difficult makeup the film contains quite a bit of good adventure level dialogue and a very strong climactic battle scene charlton heston as as andrew jackson prepared to play the part of an elder general and then discovered the man was young at the time of the battle but he is often effective grey haired or not especially in his exchanges with henry hull as mr peavey this is an exciting and well mounted entertainment which looks exactly as if c b demille had completed his production it is a beautiful and nearly a very fine motion picture

<START> rks films always have been commercial films which suited the 90's from ghayal damini br br his last few films khakee were watchable family was crap br br this film is a decent film but could be better br br the problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clichÃ©s thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and lengthy br br ajay devgan's character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle br br the lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawn br br even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out br br direction by rks is decent though it could be better music is okay br br ajay devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes he excels in dramatics vidya excels in the scene front of media pankaj has a not proper defined role and too filmy yet he excels in his part darshan jariwala hams as the old age villain the rest are okay
<START> i've been working my way through a collection of lugosi films recently and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of lugosi and boris karloff in the black cat i was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in the raven alas it just didn't work for me and by the end of the film i was quite disappointed br br for the first three quarters of this movie or so i thought the story lacked any real suspense lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad dr vollins some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman irene ware he treats after a car accident but who can't have her partly because she's already engaged and partly because her father samuel s hinds disapproves to deal with that situation he enlists the aid of edmond bateman boris karloff a horribly ugly man who wants vollins to make him look more acceptable aside from lugosi's performance though i found little to hold my interest then suddenly in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie shifts around completely suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful but i thought lugosi's performance fell apart largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane and there's a difference he plays the mad role very well controlled and in control but evil insane is a more out of control evil and i didn't think lugosi pulled that off well at one point he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake in the meantime karloff was a huge disappointment he never grabbed me at all as an aside it must have grated on lugosi that in movies in which they co star karloff gets the top billing even though in the raven it's clearly lugosi who is the lead actor this surely gives a hint as to how universal ranked their two great horror stars inexplicably i would add because i've always thought of lugosi as the better actor of the two br br in any event there's no real connection here to edgar allen poe's story the raven except that vollins is a poe fanatic who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from poe's stories overall a disappointment 4 10
<START> as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film would also like to know if he enjoys horses brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden where did he learn to ride the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt like a horse can run forever at full steam the camera work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders
<START> this movie is horrendous decent fight scenes or not the acting is really bad like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions weird pauses between different character's lines combined with hurried line delivery by others if the movie were all action this might be forgivable but a lot of the movie includes plot set up and family guy style irreverent cut aways oh wow are they badly done i'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these but it again came off as a bunch of high schoolers college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip br br now to the fight scenes they're not too bad considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film nothing great either certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated nothing like drunken master the fights have an overly staged feel with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved br br in sum the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very very cheap production which guy you may ask oh the same guy who wrote directed produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece
<START> road to perdition a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes and in my opinion his best work a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty this is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad br br it's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the michael sullivan a father of two children played by great tom hanks i'm not his admirer but ought to say that is a hit man for local mafia boss played by paul newman his eldest son a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by john rooney son of his father boss such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever the atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written but the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father son relations in bad times they are shown so deeply strong and believable tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful but one more time sad masterpiece i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year br br my grade 10 out of 10
<START> a painfully protracted maudlin and predictable drama my twenty fifth sidney lumet film garbo talks gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest br br the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert ron silver who is son to estelle rolle anne bancroft eccentric feisty and above all an obsessive fan of greta garbo when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down greta garbo and bring her to his mother br br anne bancroft is in full on chew the scenery auntie mame mode here that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves where she mouths off to people and stands up for her ideals and ends up in jail all the time she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct and every scene with her is yuk yuk lame every note striking false the rest of the characters are equally as one dimensional but tremendously less interesting ron silver is flat as can be and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film he is dating affluent lisa rolfe carrie fisher but becomes smitten with oddball co worker jane mortimer catherine hicks and i called every scene three scenes before they happen br br that's the other problem one dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story but there's simply nothing here the film's pace is glacial resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot it's both plodding and uninteresting there are plenty of guest stars so to speak including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker imagine that in yet another highly inessential scene br br late in the film it attempts to make a halfway decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives but by that time none of the characters exist as real people and the film had bored me into submission so it functions as a case of far too little far too late the film is my twenty fifth lumet directed film making him easily my most viewed director but outside of a couple egregious misses a stranger among us anyone he hasn't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks br br grade 4 5 10 c c 21 of 24 of 1984 23 of 25 lumet films
<START> this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
<START> i'm not a huge freddy krueger fan but that doesn't mean that i don't like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies i think that robert is a very good actor nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does but no offense robert this movie sucked the acting is terrible the plot is really weak and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching sometimes sequels can be better than the first such as the friday the 13th franchise i thought the remake was the best in the series but this isn't one of those movies the original was good the 2nd in my opinion was better the 3rd was okay but i haven t seen the others whatever you do don t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap
<START> i saw this bomb when it hit theaters i laughed the whole time why because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane i look back on it and realize there was not one funny thing in the whole movie at leat nothing intentional it is awfully funny that lizzie cn chew a piece of nurplex and become a gigantic carnivorous demon yet her itty bitty little dress is perfectly intact despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious and return to conciousness without any medical attention and don't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the villain that they decided they needed to create conflict uh huh br br to the person complaining about disney only targetting kids the raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement do we really need daryl hannah accusing jeff bridges of having kinky video tapes you do if you're disney and you're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above 8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script i am thoroughly convinced that disney pays off the ratings board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family friendly ratings br br what a waste of the dvd format
<START> bamboo house of dolls 1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title is a hong kong veteran chin hung kuei's killer snakes boxer's omen payment in blood etc women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films br br the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad japanese what else during the world war ii the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan shaw veteran lo lieh is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is br br there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements i won't accept to be found from any film br br the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure for example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema i have seen the same director's killer snakes 1973 which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society also it is a must for those who fear snakes br br bamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter the uncut version dubbed into a non english language released in europe at least in france italy and switzerland runs 104 pal minutes while the cut english dubbed print released in holland belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal from what i've heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like br br bamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldn't have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation 2 10
<START> who what where when why the acting was terrible very robotic rehearsed i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles the screenplay was very elementary by the end of this film the story line was tied up and jeane claude lamarre should be tied up too so that he never attempts to write direct another film
<START> legend of zu br br i remember well tsui hark's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog br br in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic prime br br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies br br well the answer is i can't say but that was because this isn't really a remake the stories and styles are almost completely different br br the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomnia br br the plot isn't one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful nothing appears rushed unlike hero the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes br br the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks' but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this br br ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i couldn't say this film showed their best performances cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to ogling br br overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original' given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pears br br ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again br br two to watch but not compare
<START> this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen pure drivel how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine or have empathy for her is beyond me i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder just terrible br br in its most generous light this can be seen as an attempt at producing and art film except i could not for the life of me find any art in it at all br br if this woman had lived in todays' world she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti psychotic medications that or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort
<START> okay so the introduction with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film is so lame it's funny and so the first skull scene is so drawn out and un suspenseful it's funny the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent there's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go the acting is average not truly bad br br altogether this movie doesn't quite fall flat in the way a 1 10 movie would it's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest if i just read the screenplay i'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie it's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie so it's a bad movie but there are much worse ones out there
<START> although it really isn't such a terribly movie especially considering it was made directly for tv distribution it'll be very difficult to point out one aspect in bloodsuckers that is actually original or refreshing vampires in space isn't exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize it's an incredibly stupid premise that can't possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare the plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from john carpenter's ghosts of mars and james cameron's aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons like the voorhees and the leatherfaces the good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clichÃ©d issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters captain damian is the unpopular rookie who'll really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved captain churchill the other annoying characters include a typical cowboy style and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board she's of asian descent like the girl in aliens was latino and the army's most valuable secret weapon a blade girl quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans she can spot enemies when they're still light years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someone's wet dreams they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire meanie michael ironside in yet another downgrading role bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings infantile dialogs and ott make up effects it only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla this film is a non stop series of lame clichÃ©s and uncreative ideas but at least it's watchable
<START> my husband and i bought the old school sesame street dvd's for our daughter and i have to say i don't let her watch the new episodes on tv because i find all of the characters annoying baby bear and telly omgosh how annoying and useless blabber can someone think of for their 'skits' elmo give it a rest not every kid likes him once again annoying and doesn't teach my child anything mr noodle what a reject i think the one time i turned the 'new' show on for her she and i were left dumber than before the show has definitely taken a wrong turn i remember the yip yips kermit's breaking news 1 2 2 little dolls mumford the magician bert and ernie grover the waiter all the great educational skits of old school s s sesame street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since jim henson's passing in 1990 the show no longer has the educational funny and interactive skits it used to i find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non educational blabber way to go s s producers writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non creative non exercised kids in front of so they'll get out of their hair per producers writers i suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first sesame street's lord knows i sure don't want my child talking like baby bear or elmo
<START> a shirley temple short subject br br it can get mighty rough at buttermilk pete's cafe when the local contingency of diaper clad war babies come in for their midday milk break br br this primitive little film a spoof of military movies provides a few chuckles but little else tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time shirley temple playing a duplicitous hip swinging french miss hasn't much to do in this pre celebrity performance highlight the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well truly soaked with milk br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films
