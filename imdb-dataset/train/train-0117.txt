<START> even worse than the worst david lynch confusathon brain dead makes no sense whatsoever shamefully wasted talent bill pullman bill paxton bounce around like they are in a tom and jerry cartoon on acid there is negligible character development it simply starts climbing the strange scale until climaxing in total chaos do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors they are given nothing to work with and you will be wondering what's going on throughout the entire unbearable 85 minutes i highly recommend avoiding brain dead at all costs unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense merk
<START> i'm a big fan of fan of film noir and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best that i've seen preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'laura' gene tierney and dana andrews for an entirely different sort of crime film laura was based around love and this film is based around hate as we watch police detective mark dixon a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal a man by the name of tommy scalisi the plot is brilliantly worked and preminger excellently balances several plot points but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character the fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from and director otto preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling beating one another and their women shooting and more and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'laura' which was very much set in upper class society br br the role of mark dixon gives dana andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career here we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he's easy to sympathise with and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight the character development is well timed and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film everything makes sense by the end his co star is the beautiful gene tierney who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in laura a film that made tierney its linchpin she does well with what she's got however and the lead duo's chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she's in i can't say that this is a better film than the earlier laura that's a hard act to follow but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than preminger's earlier film the film also makes a good comparison piece for laura as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie yet it's all strangely familiar highly recommended to all
<START> where was this film when i was a kid after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone grandfather is only here every third day moms never really home the kids always are picking on the poor kid during a village festival tadashi is chosen the kirin rider or spiritual champion of the peace and justice little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world br br okay that was the easy part now comes the hard part trying to explain the film br br this is a great kids film no this is a great film flawed very flawed but a great film none the less it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book i loved that the film does not follow a normal path things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it which is typical miike certainly its a takashi miike film that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching scary and funny all at the same time no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful that doesn't shy away from being scary i mean really scary especially for kids this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is this a dark grimms tale with humor my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world then i realized who was making the movie hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images br br its also operating on more than one level the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters one of the yokai spirits talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do its a wild concept but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level there are a good many riffs and references to other movies tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them though many parents will and of course there are the monsters they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen its way cool and it works one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters i mentioned flaws and there are a few the effects are uneven some of the sudden turns are a bit odd even if understandable and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film none of them truly hurt the film over all however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie br br i really loved this movie i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time where's the english dub see this movie its a great trip besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex
<START> this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the blob looks i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween ii br br when steve and jane are making out they see a meteor fall from space inside the meteor is the blob whenever the blob consumes a person it grows bigger and bigger they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster but no one believes them until later can anything stop this blobby creature i highly recommend the blob
<START> there's nothing amazing about 'the amazing mr williams' part of this movie's problem is its lead actor melvyn douglas he was a lousy actor and lazy with it for most of his career he allowed his good looks a glib manner and usually but not in this movie some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability i disliked douglas as an actor before i knew anything about him as a person i've learnt enough about him to know that i also despise his politics i'll give melvyn douglas credit for one thing his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress illeana douglas br br melvyn douglas made this movie right after the brilliant 'ninotchka' talk about a comedown 'the amazing mr williams' is allegedly a comedy but i never laughed douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad named kenny williams i never heard of a police detective named kenny but if they called him kenneth williams well what a carry on the whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about killing women no motive is given for this he just likes to kill women the mayor jonathan hale better than usual calls williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer br br spoilers approaching the cheap vulgar untalented and unattractive joan blondell plays the mayor's secretary she doesn't sound literate enough to file a letter much less type one blondell and douglas squabble like a cat and a dog so it's blatantly obvious they're going to end up together br br at this movie's lowest point melvyn douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman you do not want to see melvyn douglas in drag he's well over six foot and he doesn't even shave off that annoying moustache the similarly 'tashed william powell was an actor very similar in type to melvyn douglas but much more talented when powell disguised himself as a woman in 'love crazy' he had the integrity to shave off his moustache a genuine sacrifice as powell needed it to grow in again for his next role but melvyn douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie not even a razor he plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career br br on the plus side 'the amazing mr williams' has several of those splendid supporting players who made hollywood's movies of the '30s so delightful edward brophy is brilliant here touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence the dyspeptic donald macbride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer and is nearly lynched by a mob ruth donnelly is splendid as usual for her but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the warner brothers backlot jimmy conlin luis alberni and the grinning dave willock are all fine in small roles barbara pepper whom i usually dislike is good here too the grossly unpleasant maude eburne gets some screen time i always loathe her and she gives the same performance in every film but some audiences enjoy eburne's one note performance very much for reasons i can't fathom br br if you're familiar with hollywood character actors of the 1930s and the roles they tended to play one glance at imdb's cast list will tell you who the murderer is that's the problem with 'the amazing mr wiliams' everything is too obvious i'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10
<START> might contain spoilers but believe me this movie spoils itself from start to finish br br i walked into this movie with high expectations it was my own fault i had put too much stock in steve carell's record to date 40 year old virgin little miss sunshine the office and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7 5 user rating before going to the movie it's always been a very good predictor in the past but something is definitely off lately the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching blue steel in 1990 br br this flick fumbled from start to finish the script was flunky material awful writing all around murderer of love love is an ability whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty's writer s trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard the entire flick was peppered with three's company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene or the pointless confusing aerobics scene or the awful laundry room scene right when you think something serious and or real is about to happen they toss in one of these terrible moments and it happens over and over and over again br br and what's with carell's character the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love let's face it their conversation sucked they both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un funny i think the exact line was this one time when i was a kid that's it seriously but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses the actors themselves looked like they were in pain wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing br br back to the imdb thing you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site i know it's impossible but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings reviews were either posted by 12 year olds or by flunky's hired by the studio check out the family stone's rating if that's a mid 5 then this absolutely has got to be a 2 and that's pushing it
<START> samuel fuller's pickup on south street is anomalous a red scare movie devoid of hysteria in which the communist threat is nothing more than the mcguffin that ignites the plot pickpocket richard widmark relieves loose woman jean peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm unbeknownst to either of them it harbors secrets vital to the cold war peters as it happens was under surveillance by fbi agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her cowardly comsymp richard kiley in trying to retrieve the precious film both sides enlist the help of thelma ritter a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears br br fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality from the subways to the waterfront his midsummer manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent the love scenes between peters and widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender and they're scored to again a song introduced by ida lupino in road house also starring widmark the pace slackens for ritter's beautifully written and played death scene among the most poignant vignettes in all noir and a kind of mirage oasis in a film parched of sentimentality this is writer director fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle his later explorations of american pathology the crimson kimono the naked kiss underworld u s a never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as pickup on south street
<START> this movie maked me cry at the end i watch at least 3 4 movies a week i seen loads of great movies even more crap ones but when ending scene catharsic at it's core came i cried and if you didn't you have serious problems the story is archetypal nothing new or original but it's real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist glam isn't my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70's at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine docudramas never really work very good but this movie really meked us believe it all because they don't try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they don't glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late once again great movie since leaving las vegas i was never so moved by a movie
<START> this movie is truly awful after seeing the advertisement for it i thought it could have its charms but it didn't the girls cannot act and they cannot sing either the soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs and its not a pretty sight terrible story line unbelievable plot its one of disney's worst movies by far ally is not a bad actress on phil of the future so i don't know what happened in cow belles and her sister aj seems to be just hitching a ride on her sisters fame and she displays no talent what so ever br br at the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some clichÃ© morals but this is to late to rescue this train wreck movie br br awful
<START> designed only to annoy or amuse any self respecting intelligent person if the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of america's pro marxist 60s movement especially not a filmmaker from the 70s there is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire Â that's how naÃ¯ve the movie appears spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons but i mean aren't they all nice boobs but s t for brains
<START> from actor and independent writer director john cassavetes a woman under the influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability the husband nick played by peter falk is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife mabel played by gena rowlands the amount of attention that she deserves from the onset of the film it is obvious that mabel is very quirky and strange but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that crazy bonkers out of her damn mind nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co workers and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner he asks her if she'll be okay as if he's trying to deny mabel's illness her problem only spirals from there br br i did find some particular problems with this film i guess these problems were mostly present in the story and the way some of the character acted toward the end mabel has been committed because frankly she's nuts then six months later she's ready to come out of the hospital and her husband throws a party to welcome her back he never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie why would he invite all these people some of them strangers to mabel over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state it's simply idiotic later after mabel comes in the house mabel's father has a huge outburst at nick screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti his daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation and the thing you want to do is keep her calm and he goes nuts over spaghetti a few minutes later in the film nick brings mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable make her weird noises and gestures didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things there were various other parts that occurred after this but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail i guess i just had a serious problem with the decision by cassavetes to have his characters act in this way it simply didn't make sense br br however although i had problems with the ending of the film there was one aspect that really redeemed it the acting gena rowlands played an amazing crazy woman there were times when i forgot she was acting where i got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that i was actually scared of her she was amazingly convincing and intense however i was also impressed by the rest of mabel's family peter falk played a very strange character and i almost thought he was crazy himself because of the awkward way he handled his children his job and especially the situation with his wife i also usually don't appreciate child actors but the young people who played nick and mabel's children in this film were phenomenal it really felt like they were mabel's children because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem i think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense br br in general i wasn't impressed by this film the story was jumbled and unclear and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie the only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the longhetti family their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything
<START> will and ted's bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality religion time heaven and hell man's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art dante iron maiden virgil shakespeare this time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past napolean joan of ark noah's wife oscar wilde and charles darwin they took the skills they learned from each of these people abducted a couple of princesses and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs these songs teach the world to love again and war hunger evil are vanquished for eternity we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called simon cow al wants to rule the world he eats rooshus the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time the cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact it is their job to kill the good biff and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no one could like by doing this they will change the world forever gryll and jed's music will never be made leaving a world of war famine and hatred and more annoyingly bland boy girl group pop music there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world themselves and their wives from the evil dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies br br penelope spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves she presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism self love and malaise of the time charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares to overcome is to succeed to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving in the words of kenneth reeves 'wow ' best scene for a fun game see how many songs bands and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film there are at least 6
<START> everything was better in past days even children's television and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can't resist the charm of fraggle rock for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock haha fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live amazingly in a rock but they're not the only creatures the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants outside the rock on one side live inventor scientist doc and his dog sprocket who later befriends gobo fraggle on the other side a family of gorgs supposed rulers of the universe the five main fraggles gobo fearless leader mokey arty and peaceful wembley indecisive and a friend to gobo boober a pessimistic domestic god and red loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away br br fraggle rock is definitely a family show the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well but the song and dance routines will hold their attention the characters are strong and likable their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling the gorgs are frightening doc and sprocket enlightening uncle travelling matt hilarious the postcard segments are very 80s and the final episode change of address genuinely touching let's go down to fraggle rock again
<START> it was very heart warming as an expatriated french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a broader distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so br br strong and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son leo who has contracted hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two characters br br progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs
<START> alain chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old if not older than shakespeare br br chabat is a vieux garcon happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life he has a problem 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum the g7 who decide he should be married enter the delightful charming charlotte gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan charlotte has to pose as chabat's girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding no more talk of marriage from the g7 of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control br br there are very strong supporting roles from lafont as the mother and osterman as the tight fisted brother of gainsbourg br br there are some fantastic scenes as first charlotte has to charm then revolt the family french farce with an english
<START> i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie it's stupid ridiculous and just not funny at all br br since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad br br what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts br br just skip this piece of garbage br br p s sorry for my english
<START> okay i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst but it's not haven't's you seen freddy's revenge wtf that was the worst of all now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc etc br br and then i found out it was in 3 d i was so excited i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3 d sequences quite a lot was in 3 d though like lisa zanes hand dream demons freddy's claw more than once lezlie dean holding a knife lisa zane with a baseball bat doc's hand freddy's head exploding br br i truly loved this movie because it was in 3 d but i wish the whole movie was in 3 d not just the last 15 minutes br br by the way it's 15 minutes not ten
<START> this film is a huge steaming pile br br i have no idea why anyone felt that the garland mason version needed to be redone nor why striesand would have been a first choice to star br br for that matter i have no idea why our people gay americans tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure at least in my opinion she had peaked professionally with with funny girl and bogdanovich's what's up doc br br do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic or even the original a fine film in its own right but please please please skip this stinkpot
<START> roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemary's baby and chinatown probably what makes polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature le locataire or the tenant is one of those movies a horror suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done br br polanski himself plays telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant simone choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after simone dies of the injuries trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building br br while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films repulsion rosemary's baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky's head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant br br trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film br br also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive br br if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one br br while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le locataire is really one of roman polanksi's masterpieces 10 10
<START> i managed to sneak away one night and go to the movie theater to see this one thinking i was in for a treat boy was i wrong considering the talent involved this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen everyone in it was miscast and i find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there who actually liked it
