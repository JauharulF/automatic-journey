<START> dear god i kept waiting for this movie to get started then i waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither i just sat there dumbfounded that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity i had faith that drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did i ever lose my faith don't bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived i can't believe a script this bad ever got funded it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didn't go anyplace its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst baffles me because believe me if it got any worse i'd have slit my wrists before finishing it
<START> made in 1931 this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often br br we open on a quiet little french village scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens then we hear something that sounds like a party upon investigating the uproar two neighboring men are told the story of two men supposedly friends who picked two numbers for the lottery br br our star of the picture has his number and his friend his when he asks his friend would he share half of the dough should his ticket be the winning number his friend promptly says no in fact h e double hockey sticks no is the way he acts about it br br so when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost through no fault of his own he is frantic everyone is out for themselves looking for this ticket in something like a precursor to the great race even though this is all a flashback i was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all for me show me the money cash in the bank film watch le million today
<START> felix unger jack lemmon has just been dumped by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world suicide is his way out but he just can't seem to get it to work so he heads over to his friends house oscar madison walther matthau is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven smoking gambling hitting on chicks eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him well with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in at first it is a match made in heaven felix cooks and cleans and helps oscar pay his alimony on time but soon oscar is jonesing for women and felix who in today's world would probably be gay isn't ready to move on they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are weeping and chatting about his family life leaving oscar denied this is it he explodes and throws him out but felix isn't as helpless as it seems and soon he has the upper hand my favorite quote you leave me little notes on my pillow told you 158 times i can't stand little notes on my pillow we're all out of cornflakes f u took me three hours to figure out f u was felix ungar based on a neil simon play who also wrote the screenplay this has a certain theatre feel to it set and the repartee and looks feel quite play like for better or worse lemmon and mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the grumpier old men movies and out to sea reprising the same finicky slob roles but with different names to avoid royalty issues i'm sure br br this movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate the chocolate is smooth sweet and rich the strawberry is tart juicy and bright red unless you get those nasty greenish ones they are almost polar opposites but together the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert 7 10 br br http blog myspace com locoformovies
<START> all dogs go to heaven is on a par with watership down for scary kiddies films both were dark and pretty sinister but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have this was one of my favourite films as a kid i was in love with charlie and at the tender age of about five or six i'll admit i had a crush on a cartoon dog all dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad charlie and his partner in crime itchy the story starts with charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling of course as a child i didn't understand the concept of this film i loved the songs and the animation but as i've got older i do begin to wonder why i wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster it deals with pretty adult themes gambling murder hell and prison but in a world of goody goody disney films it's something every child should watch once br br yes there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when i was little but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents
<START> this movie was astonishing it is beyond atrocious i often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value my friend suggested this one but as we watched it people began to leave i really wanted to finish it just so that i could say that i had but i was unable to it's that bad horrible running gags lame acting the main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and whoopi goldberg i would rather watch costener's the postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again i think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail and then guffawing about it it hurts watch it if you're an aspiring masochist otherwise leave this one alone
<START> this flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13 i'd label this flick softer core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder there is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see kane hodder's keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster's for a costume 13 year old boys rejoice br br other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i've seen in years the shots look like fmv's from the video game resident evil in terms of quality the wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many times br br the plot and acting make no sense there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches once more this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best i can tell the mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something br br you'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did want quality low end werewolf ism go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t a this is your flick
<START> frankie dio lee vancleef is a high ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling for reasons that seem unclear to me tony tony lo bianco is a low level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying frankie by being in the right place at the right time tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship but it will do for now br br this film came to me under the title of frank and tony which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is mean frank and crazy tony which would have helped sell the film more effectively i presume that's an homage to dirty mary crazy larry but what do i know i watched it shortly after another italian crime film violent professionals and i must say the two complement each other very well br br italians have always lagged behind americans in their budgets and production values which is a real shame with this film it is considered a grindhouse film which unfairly demotes it to a b movie or worse with a cleaner sound and picture this could have been a hollywood hit i suspect i found the story very interesting the characters and actors better than average and unlike violent professionals the plot is fairly clear not too many secondary characters br br if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try a film about the mob that's actually from italy how much more authentic do you want is as much as you can ask sure it's not the godfather but it's not supposed to be this isn't a drama it's a light comedy heavy action buddy film like die hard with a vengeance from the point of view of the bad guys well okay not really br br if nothing else this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast films besides escape from new york where vancleef plays hauk and the usual cult movies what's more fun than discovering a lost classic
<START> i can tell you just how bad this movie is i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk especially considering what we did that year the thing is that they probably over edited it especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute they probably should have followed him around we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything i was the mc in a few scenes from what i'm told what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world or the girl that loser lost his virginity to overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them
<START> i have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show the acting was ham fisted and amateur the story was old news and plot development or lack thereof invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode that's about all there is to say of it because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind br br how can you people like crap like this it's freaking stupid it's an insult to your intelligence i don't even know how to further explain it it's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look or because for whatever crazy reason you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before br br i just forget it this show sucked and thankfully it's gone forever i wish they'd get to work on demolishing the o c once and for all
<START> i love the movie it was a very interesting fantasy movie b c of the real meaning of family in it the history of our country the fun filled action displayed in the movie i watch time the top about 4 x's a week and i just love it i wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of susan's dad in the past and watching how susan delt with her new baby sister and having no telephone computers gameboys or anything of the 21st century i hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as i did i guess you could say i'm a time at the top fanatic and i don't mind the lil boy in the movie robert lincoln walker was simply adorible i wonder who he is and how old he is today does anyone know if he's played in over movies or tv shows
<START> there is a key aspect of film that jobson seems to have forgotten it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you you don't need to tell the audience what to think because they'll see it the action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former and it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals maybe jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support and he may have been right it lacks a basic credibility 70s edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the velvet underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath from the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together it's all too contrived for my taste
<START> hilarious evocative confusing brilliant film reminds me of bunuel's l'age d'or or jodorowsky's holy mountain lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for what is it i laughed almost the whole way through all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre entertaining through and through from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end if it was an end i only wish i could remember every detail it haunts me sometimes br br honestly though i have only the most positive recollections of this film as it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch i suppose i'll have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show and subsequent what is it screening i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash so i was slightly dazed at the time which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly q setting scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dream br br is it a statement on life as we know it of course everyone expects art to be just that i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space what you don't tell us is what we must deduce but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out rather one what is it than 5000 movies like titanic or sleepless in seattle shudder gag groan br br thank you mr glover additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show smart funny quirky and outrageously hot make more films write more books keep the nightmare alive
<START> this is a script that ed wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made aris iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other more transitory valuables br br this is a dialogue free movie that some may foolishly describe as silent in fact it is a quite noisy film without the inane chatter of most flicks in the hands of these filmmakers the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the hollywood script mill particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in 'watch out ' 'oh no ' j cameron ick i'll take zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day br br billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film ricci is radiant as always and the gods are shining when you can put sandra bernhard rick y schroeder eartha kitt and andrew mccarthy's name on the same poster br br the design is perfect the pyramid set exquisite and ron perlman's beastly performance is simply wonderful overall this is a chaotic visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr auteur and cinenephile a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate iliopulos and his cast obviously do a film to make you wish you had made it yourself
<START> i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating urinating vomiting swearing and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable this is not cinema friends and neighbors this is simply visual perversion forget about bunuels chien andalou about david lynch about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness those people were mastering their jobs well you don't do us a favor all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old timers and leave us alone its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen enough with your immature terribilisms you are not directors you are illiterate
<START> this film was really eye opening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12 the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him br br a great movie for non believers and believers alike
<START> this movie was a classic i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride
<START> this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle stallone is gabe walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john litghow other stars micheal rooker the portrait of serialkiller janine turner strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie br br remember extreme Ã¤Ã¤liÃ¶t special collectors edition with good extras comig soon in finland straight to video
<START> i am a christian and i feel this movie is awful br br nobody but hard core bible belt christians are going to like this movie the message is just too in your face if you want to touch a wider audience you have to be way more subtle you can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in every scene ridiculous br br poor direction the reveal of people missing should have been terrifying but it was laughable they leave their clothes on the ground it reminded me of old ed wood movies oh my god people are missing that scene in the plane is just stupid think about it if you found your relative's clothes next to you you wouldn't just scream oh my god they disappeared they're missing and start crying and yelling you would first be in denial you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion watch jodie foster in flightplan my favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him i about fell off the couch i was laughing so hard br br the music was so bad and so distracting it was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies here's my chance to do a thriller here's my chance to do action stop telling me how to feel james covell a good score supports what's happening on the screen this movie needed more of an under score but instead it was as much in your face as the message was br br the writing was bland so was captain christian kirk cameron chelsea was the worse you don't understand people are missing brad johnson was laughable the two stand out performances came from the anti christ and the older guy sorry can't remember their names in watching the making of to answer my question of what were they thinking the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves saying we're gonna reach wide audiences and brad johnson is amazing and this is just like a hollywood movie i came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the heck they are doing br br i commend the effort getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea film is the best medium possible to do that look at movies like wide awake signs contact passion of christ even o'brother where art thou the bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision unfortunately it was not
<START> you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o'hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude's husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can't buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene
<START> i just saw of human bondage for the first time a few days ago and wow what a mysterious and almost spooky film i loved how the music went with the pace of each step of philip's feet it gave me the chills for some reason br br one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes she's great not necessarily because this is her best work but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious gritty and unflinching as an actress in 1934 bette was a risk taker always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it if you're a true lover of film it's amazing to see br br she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her like a mass of music and fire that's me an old kazoo and some sparklers or but you are blanche you are in that chair or with all my heart i still love the man i killed those are from a few of her films but you get my drift she was just so brave sassy and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes after seeing this i can't believe it was remade twice br br leslie howard was gorgeous so calm and persistent needing to be loved i thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him but then again everyone was except mildred he did a great job br br the only thing that i didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films they'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place the performances were great but in real life philip would have never been interested in mildred that's just the simple truth see it
