<START> lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show well if that idea doesn't intrigue you which it shouldn't stay away from ringmaster i had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie i guess jerry springer doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show and he is only known as jerry in the film the plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother's live in boyfriend so the mother's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter's boyfriend is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin' man with her friend in bed together so of course call america's therapist jerry springer i'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache jamie pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie and remember michael dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his charecter but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestites well just watch the show instead at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick
<START> yes indeed it could have been a good movie a love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical it's a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious
<START> i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays such as the ones of for example vanity fair or the other boleyn girl but with a magnificent production design european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have fortunately the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story the excellent performances from emily blunt paul bettany and jim broadbent and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view and i say unexpectedly because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details br br victorian era was in my humble opinion one of the key points in contemporary civilization and not only on the social aspect but also in the scientific artistic and cultural ones but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good but they were at least inspired by good intentions i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichÃ©s of the romantic cinema on the love story something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay br br i liked the young victoria very much and i really took a very nice surprise with it i hope more period films follow the example of this movie the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story and not as the replacement of it
<START> johnathan frakes is a good actor and when he's not directing a family film a fine director but he really shouldn't have directed this movie and the screenplay should've been rejected the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked the original series had many episodes with razor sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children's programming much less a movie which made the original series so well received by adults i mean the tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco and there were characters who did get killed although most were bad guys if they had written it the way that it was originally done which isn't dumbing things down with poor dialogue kindergarten humor and a weak plot this universal studio canal joint venture wouldn't have such bad reviews br br this motion picture is almost pure blasphemy if you've seen the original supermarionation series then you'll know what i'm talking about br br the first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to ford motor company even going so far that lady penelope was riding around in a disfigured ford thunderbird made up to look like fab 1 instead of using what would've been more appropriate considering ms penelope's station not to mention being more faithful to the original a rolls royce fab 1 she's supposed to be a distinguished member of british society hence the preference for england's finest make of motorcars in the original series one other reviewer here indicated that penelope wouldn't be caught dead in a ford he's pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn't work at least they could have had penelope ride in a jaguar made up like fab 1 since jaguar is a british car make that is owned by ford but no they had to use a straight ford but the ford product placement doesn't end there every single car you may see is a ford even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were sponsored by ford ford ford ford the predominance of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford br br the original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today but the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional this kind of treatment didn't exist in the movie where everything is stylized to excess defeating the sense of functionality and practicality a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason br br the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets bringing them to life in the episodes the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story the characters and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective a little bit of stanislavski talk the movie on the other hand had some overly grating performances anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn't work despite decent acting one of few there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley and many others that i don't care to mention it would take too long quite simply the puppets were more believable second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by hans zimmer sounding more like a mix between days of thunder and apollo 13 br br and of course the hood the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with kyrano through a statue of kyrano as an outlet for esp contact but that was where his extraordinary capability ended he's a master of disguise and deception which allows him to sneak around undetected for the most part anyways to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means he also uses weapons for his own defense including pistols and generally collects information using a film camera although he tried to steal thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s united artists release of thunderbird 6 which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in supermarionation and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release but while he is a nemesis of international rescue the hood isn't the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue in the movie he's obviously the main villain but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons along with the hood having extended mind control ability including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time this totally deviates from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust br br there are more criticisms but the 1000 word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them so i will close with the point being made that i didn't enjoy this movie as a matter of fact i think it sucks having seen the original series and supermarionation movies thunderbirds are go thunderbird 6 i was hoping for something a lot better than this br br the original supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce and that's saying it nicely kip wells
<START> i grew up watching inspector gadget it was and still is one of my favorite cartoons if not my absolute favorite i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin off inspector gadget's field trip i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever br br but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon br br matthew broderick an actor with potential was definitely not the role for inspector gadget first thing in the film inspector gadget is smart not so in the cartoon in the film gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself in the cartoon it was almost always penny brain and the awesome book i still want her book if gadget solved the mystery it was by accident gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective but in the cartoon was pretty dumb which was where the humor came from br br another thing is that it's too much good guy v bad guy in the film it's not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon also gadget never should have a love story but disney corporation is filled with idiots br br also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had and especially the gadget car in the movie it was a chic convertible in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place br br but if anything the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon the movie was too serious too overdone had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny br br tip for those who haven't seen it never see it ever watch the cartoon it's a true classic
<START> i just watched the documentary fog city mavericks on the starz cable tv network it is without a doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made in addition to the well known artists listed t also includes segments with irvin kershner caleb deschanel and a segment about pixar animation studios i hope it will be released on dvd this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film making if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them you will not be disappointed
<START> wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince simon who is banished from his kingdom due to his father the king being killed by the cliche evil adviser this movie's about simon's adventures the special effects plot acting and generally everything about this movie is bad however it's so bad that it's funny you will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny and like the other reviewer of the movie said it's so bad it's good
<START> the mere fact that i still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film to me this substantiates grand canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another i truly believe that before the movie crash there was grand canyon the major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release i'm not going to argue which one is better but i will contend to the idea that they share the same message i'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject i will start a commentary which you can find at http www myspace com 62229249 you may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share because i have a true love for film
<START> this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens' bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book contrary to what is probably received opinion diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock she was clunky and wooden lady d is a reserved character but not a martinet denholm elliot is wrong wrong wrong for mr jarndyce so i'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying i didn't read the book so i don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book true and not true for ex diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book on the other hand denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce although too old the series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book but because the various plot lines and characters just don't coalesce to make a coherent dramatic mysterious andcompelling entertainment it is dull and flat if you want to make apossibly good bleak house you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes but i suggest that producers etc leave dickens alone even a christmas carol television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters
<START> 'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe byrne and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned's actions br br there is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life great job heath orlando bloom was fantastic as joe playing the role of quiet loyal ladiesman very well i was swept up in the moment for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan alas it was not to be br br some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan and supporter was slightly disappointed by this perhaps also the film could've gone longer to cover more of the kelly gang's ned's life i felt not enough was covered br br regardless of a few flaws this is a moving film which stirs all sorts of emotions and hey i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned
<START> seriously the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind this show isn't funny it isn't clever it isn't original it's just a steaming pile of bull crap let me start with the characters the characters are all one dimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard the voice acting could've been better then there's the animation my god it hurts my eyes just looking at it everything is too flat too pointy too bright and too candy coated then there's the humor or lack thereof it's completely idiotic they just take these b grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me and finally last and least the music it's just plain annoying it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever i wish there was a score lower than 1 i really do this show seriously needs to be canceled it's a show i try to avoid like the plague whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off if you've never watched this show then don't watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama
<START> the movie started off strong ll cool j deed as an undercover police officer with partner sgt lazerov dylan mcdermott from the practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience the other big names freeman spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promise br br the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake pollack is introduced given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake i would choose the former even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him i would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years everything he did in this film was unconvincing br br just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films even hardcore n'sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent br br that aside there are a few plot holes such as pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery this movie had so much promise thoroughly disappointing
<START> i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some cheap thrillers but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did br br sur mes lÃ¨vres or read my lips as it is called in english tells the story of a young secretary named carla she is a hardworking and loyal employee but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her all this is about to change paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex convict the man is a thief but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life br br since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller which this movie definitely is i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard's directing fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie i hadn't heard of him before but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband you know the typical tv movie story br br also worth noticing is the acting in this movie vincent cassel is quite famous but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles but they both did an excellent job with their characters making them feel very believable and realistic paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman but thanks to their performances you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together br br all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting despite the fact that i had my doubts about it i've soon become one of its greatest admirers i give this movie an 8 10 don't hesitate to give it a try
<START> an enjoyable game which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today also the narration and animated scenes used though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo 64 version use full advantage of the platforms' capabilities
<START> got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting actors br br excellent plot very well placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very funny br br all in all i give this film a big thumbs up it's extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
<START> 10 items or less is one of those 'under the radar' pictures that is drenched in the simplicity that most independent movies have honest ad hoc performances by its two leads morgan freeman and paz vega who establish quite a complementary if unlikely duo the great thing is this entire movie looks improbable despite its 'road movie' roots how morgan freeman's unnamed character psychically not physically arrives to where he meets this jaded check out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by bobby cannavale in a small role is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter two people on opposite sides of the coin of society is deceptively simple so in a nutshell while there aren't any bang moments of earth shattering revelations this movie is a quirky little mood piece that probably otherwise got lost in the shuffle of indies which came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen if only for its honesty
<START> ooverall the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but chuck norris did hardly anything except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters the movie was very similar to the events of sept 11 with a bin laden like terrorist sending a video to the president urich and threatening to detonate it judson mills had some superb action roles taking out rashid's compound and various kick butt roles but there was a lack of chuck norris judson took over most of the action leaving joshua chuck with que on her computer but overall it was realistic and didn't lack the action but only did it on mr norris' part i gave the film 7 10
<START> as a native film professor i can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with native content that i have ever viewed i would rather get a root canal than view this film again the use of stereotyping uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story line and bad script the writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying native people and communities if this person is native they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed if this person is non native they need to seriously re examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined unintentional racism or if they are intentionally being ignorant my only hope is that the native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts if you want to see good native films then check out christmas in the clouds dance me outside medicine river powwow highway smoke signals to name just a few
<START> i loved adrianne curry before this show i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won i also liked chris knight he seems like a great guy but this show just made me sick i'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show i don't care that they were different ages i know age can't stand between love but adrianne you had been together for only seven months it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed and i don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready if it's meant to be then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other and let it come naturally turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary it's stupidly obvious that chris loves you with or without a ring and chris shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway you've been through two failed marriages how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit i hope the relationship lasts but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage
<START> i have to confess that i am severely disappointed br br this version can in no way compete with the version of 1995 the reason why i watched it was that i wasn't entirely happy with ciaran hinds as captain wentworth and thought that rupert penry jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book and he was too br br unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film the rest is as un austen like as possible br br miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this it wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity there are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst br br although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed br br and although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives important scenes were omitted how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way a disaster and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one br br no no no if you love austen then don't waste your time with this
