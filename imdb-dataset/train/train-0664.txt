<START> ok i knew this would be a back alley f film well below b film standards going into it so i thought man i could use a good laugh so let's see some nether beings kill each other well what i got could have been found at your local love toy store random lesbian scenes very little fighting and no plot br br for example one scene in particular i remember for its sheer stupidity only i've seen better porn on abc is where the two main characters i can't remember their names offhand great movie huh are driving along as they mostly did and the driver was tired of driving and stopped br br driver let's pull over i'm tired you want to take over passenger sure i can drive for a while once pulled over the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boobs passenger what are you doing i'm not like that driver it's ok everyone does it sometime passenger ok then proceed to take off shirts fondle kiss and perform fellatio br br now last time i checked horror films were not in the porn section of hollywood video unless you're into s m then you go elsewhere and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at blockbuster don't get me wrong i'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn but i only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if i'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores as this one i rented was at one of the two retailers i named and probably at the other too if i went and looked br br worst movie ever no one should rent it and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony if i could give it a 0 i would but i can only give it a of 10
<START> i hate to sound like an 'old person' but frankly i haven't seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle the bread my sweet except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s i didn't buy it i'm 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s more than capable of surviving on my own as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13 got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey br br the daughter is not believable in her job role she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist' when she was just doing what any career oriented person would do taking advantage of a wide open opportunity created by the lack of self discipline of her coworker a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss in this case br br the daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her life and raised her to 'adulthood' like a pariah apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is not 'the common thing' for parents to act like children and then be treated as children by their children that is just more of the societal 'baloney' that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings br br this is a sad movie with a stupid ending if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two dimensional 'tv character' he'd have stayed with the mother who was not that much older than him and quite attractive but in the end he 'falls' for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth but in an ordinary bland way the 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physically br br there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish self centered b tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother a woman who was kindhearted sweet tempered humorous and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend of course the mother had her own flaws she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter br br regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney where's the mustard
<START> gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together look for great performances from keaton gedde watanabe george wendt mimi rogers john turturro soh yamamura and sab shimomo all are perfectly cast don't be fooled by the low number rating this is a 7 5 in my book it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon yes there is a real hadleyville but in oregon
<START> walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act lewis and clark who haven't spoken in over 10 years burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today richard benjamin shines as matthau's nephew and agent there's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a pop rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small role br br the only problem i had with it and maybe i'm being too picky and or serious is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet granted he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context also i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns and matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old br br all in all if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles put in the sunshine boys they'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life br br benjamin you have to slide it br br matthau wait wait i think you have to slide it
<START> oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn't love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking not acting you'll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni anderson's hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burt's wig wasn't bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run 2 the original smokey and cannonball and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isn't even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you'll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on it's lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt's coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so
<START> so what constitutes a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy br br which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isn't afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that kallio the director didn't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place he's in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don't be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel br br if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer points of the horror suspense genres check this film out br br yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with hatred so that it could do so either br br my advice though to all dead ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr kallio and mr campbell are trying to show you br br the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these don't even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horror film campiness br br technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any bog down points or bad anti climaxes br br all in all hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi million dollar fake indies but personally i don't see a problem with that it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie br br check this one out
<START> i was raised watching the original batman animated series and am an avid batman graphic novel collector with a comic book hero as iconic as batman there are certain traits that cannot be changed creative liberties are all well and good but when it completely changes the character then it is too far i purchased one of the seasons of the batman in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity in an interview on the making of the batman one of the artists or writers i'm unsure which said that we felt we shouldn't mess with batman but we could mess with the villains so they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention the penguin into some anime knockoff mr freeze into a super powered jewel thief poison ivy into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave br br to sum it all up i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name warner bros rethink this please
<START> are you familiar with concept of children's artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any three year old has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuqua's name appears on so many best ofÂ film lists br br i will never disagree with someone that fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuqua's greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did not br br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad libed and what should be used to further the plot instead we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second fuqua should have stopped this immediately foxx's jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were brining nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were pawns filling in dead air space fuqua had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that accusation br br overall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i don't think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some edible characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble br br grade out of for his two scenes that were fun to watch
<START> there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law anything that can go wrong will go wrong this is exactly the case for dan burns steve carell the office a columnist for the local newspaper dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy tragedy and beauty of them all besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious br br the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life the first one anxious to try out her drivers license the middle one well into her teenage angst phase and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore br br her name is marie juliette binoche chocolat and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household br br if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life the frustration and sincere compassion the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability which is an irony within itself br br dan in real life is definitely worth seeing for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time or even a third just put it on my tab
<START> i couldn't believe my eyes once i've watched this movie there's no point in it either then blood and violence unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood gore and killing one after another this movie isn't interesting at all has no meaningful plot or story line nor does it have an intelligence in it the blood looks very fake and this movie overall is pointless don't even waste your time with it it's just an hour or two of mindless violence it has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw
<START> when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standardsÂ let's give it a chanceÂ i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first it's not a comedy it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhereÂ it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another directionÂ the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80'sÂ the acting should have been better tooÂ well to sum up it's not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad productionÂ i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than i've ever imagined just forget about it
<START> this isn't a bad movie but it's the type your girlfriend makes you watch the story isn't bad it just makes the hour and a half seem so long it's hard for me to trash this movie because i really do like the idea of it but it was just to long and thin on story too bad the main character never really seems to change all that much from beginning to end i mean goes through something life changing and he can barely break a smile i really thought mac was really good his weird quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster maybe i just don't get this film if anyone can explain it to me i'd love to be informed
<START> these are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking it's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so i was really surprised with john abraham's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar i was also quite surprised with the akshaye's 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about akshaye's dissapearence to the other girls i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing also majority of songs are good it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood
<START> this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can
<START> i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie displayed in the horror section in an oxford street store and also advertised as a classic thriller in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur askey one of the most popular names in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades br br perhaps his incessantly cheerful exuberant and essentially good natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much british comedy of the past twenty five years however there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos askey was an idol of the great tommy cooper who frequently borrowed the self strangulation gag that arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with br br there is a striking rare appearance by the under rated linden travers who makes an impact as the mysterious julie
<START> this show is wonderful it has some of the best writing i ever seen it has brilliant directing by dvid trainer who also directed another smart television series called boy meets world br br this show is with out a dought one of the greatest like three's company roseanne and the famous cosby show this will be on television for a long time to come br br from it's perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't this show appeals to the young and the young at heart a perfect show
<START> just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick something to avoid when making a film characters blabbering senseless overwrought convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing if the film is an attempt at social realism these verbal barrages are so over the top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent is it the acting or the script that is bad or both br br the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism ravenously consuming canonical english literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated and how is such an unattractive unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street despite his whining and self pitying banter br br the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature nostradamus and the book of revelations the impending doom of mankind in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion is presented to a character who is oh so cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space br br this flick is over scripted and over the top a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of mankind life etc it is trite overwrought and tedious br br there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film nil by mouth is an excellent far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu ditto for in the warzone and although the comparison is not even warranted check out anything by peter greenaway who far more deftly handles dialogue wit and absurd characters and situations
<START> if only eddie murphy were born 10 years later then we'd all remember it but even i was only 4 when it came out if you haven't seen it yet rent dr dolittle showtime i spy pluto nash and all eddie's family comedy movies then watch this hands down you'll laugh 90 of the time the other 10 you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes br br it really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes from crude humor to a joke for kids if you've seen it you'll laugh here you'll love his stuff if you can or are a big fan try to download clips from eddie's acts allot of the shows are different as you'd imagine and he has even more funny jokes br br but this is like the best of eddie murphy 'x rated' if you will br br and all i can say is please don't watch delirious if you don't like comedy don't have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with you will only put down this great eddie murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it br br if you wanna know how eddie got beverly hills cop and got famous from it delirious is it
<START> i couldn't agree more with the other comment it's like falling down peter weller is ok and william hurt great as always except in lost in space this is a good movie with pretty good performances very recommendable if you like falling down you're going to enjoy this one 8 of 10
<START> i was expecting to love this movie film noir serial killer dark irony i was baffled by many choices the characters made hey i know they're creepy looking but let's hook up for a cross country road trip anyway found the pacing to be glacial and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer br br thinking about it now this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense o meter 1992 model before starting to film
