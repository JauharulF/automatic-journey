<START> br br i'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of homer hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book rocket boys but the movie october sky an anagram of the book's title is good enough to stand alone i have not read hickam's memoirs but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation the film directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick records the story of teenager homer hickam jake gyllenhaal beginning in october of 1957 it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik the first artificial satellite in orbit we see a images of a blue gray town and its people mostly miners working for the olga coal company one of the miners listens to the news on a hand held radio as he enters the elevator shaft but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness losing sight of the starry sky above him a melancholy violin tune fades with this image we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting october 5 1957 coalwood west virginia homer and his buddies roy lee cook william lee scott and sherman o'dell chad lindberg are talking about football tryouts football scholarships are the only way out of the town and working in the mines for these boys why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college questions homer roy lee replies they're also the only ones who get the girls homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother so he is destined for the mines and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky then he wants to build a rocket i want to go into space says homer after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's natalie canerday fence homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson chris owen quentin asks homer what do you want to know about rockets homer quickly anwers everything his science teacher at big creek high school miss frieda riley laura dern greatly supports homer and the four boys work on building rockets in homer's basement his father however whose life is the mine does not support him john hickam chris cooper believes that homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets that the coal mines are all that matter the coal from the mines is used to make steel and without steel the country would be nothing the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship you can't just dream your way out of coalwood she tells homer homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets improving the models with each attempt despite the many attempts the boys do not lose their determination what are the chances of us winning that science fair o'dell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments a million to one answers homer that good o'dell replies well why didn't you say so the music composed by mark isham conveys sadness and hope at the same time especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood rollicking 1950s' rock and roll including songs by the coasters and buddy holly occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners the film photographed by fred murphy also uses colors to set moods and symbolize the town of coalwood actually filmed in tennessee is washed with blues grays and browns it's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces clothes houses and roads when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the blue gray world of coalwood to symbolize getting out but it is still subtle the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal hope and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer's stubborn father who doesn't recognize or just doesn't want to admit that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building is aware that the town is dying with the community disintegrating the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations again i'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism october sky has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real
<START> this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all i know i've personally run into this many times thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving people don't do it an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause personally i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same if you care about your family make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people thanks for showing us the way
<START> minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky zooms maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing up until the time flashes on the screen of 12 01pm you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing to be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief forget about trigger man i know i am trying to merk
<START> i always follow the dakar so when my husband bought charlie's 'race to dakar' dvd home i couldn't wait to watch it of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on but that never gives the background and specific teams br br if you watched long way round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensive br br i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlie's hair but he had it styled before dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged tho' i could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol as with lwr the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand and winced at every bruise he sustained while training and of course the death of andy caldicott that was an appalling tragedy but then every year there's something br br russ drives me nuts although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in lwr it's great to see him get along so well now with charlie br br what i learned from this odyssey was 1 never let scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything they had months to prepare the x5 and still the day before the team left for lisbon scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race 2 the dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider driver retrieval plan leaving matt and presumably a large number of other riders drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence 3 charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'rough and tough' adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he'd like and finally 4 charlie and ewan are planning another of these epos called the long way down in 2007 and i can't wait to get my hands on it d if you love bikes and or genuinely nice blokes 'having a go' you have to watch this i guarantee you love it it's very entertaining br br in conclusion to simon pavey you sir are a hero i was so impressed by the your 'quiet achiever' manner and the fact that you actually finished just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is and to charlie matt and the rest of the team full marks for pulling it off to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable you're all wonderful
<START> it is queen victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her prime minister lord melbourne to the extent that she became known as mrs melbourne after the death of her beloved husband albert she was referred to as the widow at windsor and years later a long friendship with her scottish ghillie john brown earned her the nickname mrs brown such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society the reality is somewhat different and young victoria goes some way towards putting the record straight depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy plotting and counter plotting naked ambition and sometimes outright murder as an 18 year old innocent victoria ascended to her uncle's throne thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power struggle between prime minister lord melbourne and his rival sir robert peel lord melbourne cuts a dash in the old public school man kind of way with his finely honed cynicism and his well polished gems of advice hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him and even perhaps a little in love an awe that he ruthlessly exploits drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against victoria's better judgement into the arena rides prince albert on a mission from king leopold of belgium keen on political rapprochement between great britain and the rest of europe at first a reluctant suitor he soon falls in love with the english queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers the young victoria is a beautifully photographed brilliantly scored and very sumptuous movie i note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century english royalty should somehow have shown the empress of india and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse i don't think so i must single out the remarkable miss emily blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young princess margaret's hers is obviously the pivotal role and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from mr jim broadbent miss miranda richardson and miss harriet walter all immeasurably more experienced the music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive the fact that britan flourished more under its two great queens elizabeth the first and victoria than at any other time is a matter feminists might like to make more of but i suspect like prime minister margaret thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable if you can work out why there might be a ph d in it
<START> i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
<START> i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel' iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples
<START> maybe it's the dubbing or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films i've ever seen the film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son sandro franchina whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ettore giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham fisted subtlety as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes by the final tear soaked scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st francis
<START> i first heard about white noise when i saw the tv advert before then i didn't even know it existed i watched the trailer online and decided that i would go and see it now being a fan of films like the sixth sense i thought that this film would give me everything i wanted it has michael keaton in it and he rocks unfortunately the film did not deliver it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echoes and failed miserably it has a very promising start but the middle just drags on repeating itself and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out unfortunately like most scary films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump this film could have been so much more it's a shame because it was a good idea
<START> this was not the worst movie i've ever seen but that's about as much as can be said about it it starts off with some good atmosphere the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating the mood is set to eerie and then nothing well somethings just somethings that clearly don't fit in and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters and the hospital they've taken over i mean come on biker duds some band watched a bit too much gwar br br my personal favorite was the head demon who looks rather a lot like a middle aged trucker desperately attempting menace while simultaneously looking like he'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan covered couch undo his belt pop a can of cheap beer probably schlitz and watch the game honestly i've seen far scarier truckers at truckstops drinking coffee wwwwoooooohhhhhhoooooooo scary br br the other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less scary at least on the dvd the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital they apparently just randomly pop up in places play some bippy metal and cause people to be dead a bit barring a few good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing there's just nothing here it's a background noise movie only
<START> the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie johnson's acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other
<START> from what i've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to part 1 initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1 part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion it is not soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different outcomes he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director the film is far from perfect it is probably too long at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture che's capture and death are dealt with well the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2
<START> here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase low budget a horrible name our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes molecular reorganization students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies sounds like a resurrection of classic b movies from the 50s right nope it's not an example of high camp fun which is way way off the mark a glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure opposing the horror that should have had 99 44 more in the first place bottom of the barrel entertainment at its best aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic guru the mad monk 1970 the work of an intelligent genius who has a master's degree in film production it's an automatic f so rest easy
<START> though i'd heard that cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance after all first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4 000 and though it looks even cheaper i can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as i watched it i realized why but whatever chances you're ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes it's an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and they're made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two count'em minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it's not even funny bad br br we've all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong there's gang rape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clark's films though also moralist and sexploitative are high class masterworks compared to this crap br br i don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numb minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesn't care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but he's a narcissistic control freak he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is i could relate to that br br despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism hand held video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he can't even decide where to put his camera there's use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with it br br it's very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo's blat can be highly effective under good direction as in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped actors in recent memory he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn br br the film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middle class youth stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he's trying to preach in fiction but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they're middle class and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior i couldn't tell br br with its dogmatic self righteousness headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom cama de gato is bad for a 1 000 reasons but above all it's harmful in a very insidious manner it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument cama de gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten
<START> to be clear from the get go 'the bagman' is very very very bad it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it's actually hysterically funny to watch this is a very low grade film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence i'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not for example the movie takes place in 'doomsville ' note to all prospective home buyers if the town you're moving to is called 'doomsville ' keep moving stephanie beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen i couldn't help but laugh because it has intentional humour she turns on the gas stove get it the sex is that hot get it and unintentional humour the unintentional in this case is the music it's like the theme music for 'chariots of fire' goes electronica break out the computer and the synthesizers i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive i really feel for them because the work here is so well intentioned the problem is that cheap music isn't necessarily good music i haven't laughed so hard at sex on screen since 'alone in the dark' with that 'seven seconds' song i guess they were implying that poor old mr slater was a bit quick on the draw even the end credits are hilarious intentional or not you be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast and an animal wrangler was on set for them the boom is credited to 'mr b stick ' and the 3rd unit's wardrobe yep they had a third unit is credited to k mart maybe it's just me but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film the movie is very very bad but the goals of stephanie beaton her friends and family are so well intentioned in 'the bagman' that you can't help but like the movie they've produced 'the bagman' is bad but not dreadful in its own sweet way it even manages to be a bit endearing it wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly br br watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this some of them might look cheaper or have worse acting or sillier production value they may not suffer terribly as 'the bagman' does from awful editing sound and foley effects mr b stick didn't do a very good job the special effects look to be where most of the money went they tend to be more funny than gruesome although when the 'bagman' is finally unmasked at the end the make up job there is surprisingly well done br br my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves b movie or low budget film aficionados all others should probably avoid with great prejudice
<START> all dogs go to heaven is the most cutest animated film to have dogs in 1989 the previous don bluth film the land before time 1988 became a success dogs are so cute as little mice aw i just want to hug them when they're cute where was i oh yes its animation is beautiful the characters are great when they're perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching it opened in november 17 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature animation br br the part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie shame on him the love survive song performed by irene cara and freddie jackson was so beautiful all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever
<START> i was going to say this was the worst gay themed film i've ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i've ever seen br br you know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audience's understanding for the many challenges facing a first time director the audio track is so bad in many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased i'm sure there are many challenges facing a first time director but don't try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale but also the only that's the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie
<START> ok i'm not an american but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin's unfunny attempt to be peter seller's inspector clouseau another abortive attempt in my opinion to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career some of your contributers say 'steve martin puts his own stamp on the character' to that i would say 'balderdash' his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come
<START> spoilers careful br br what can i say i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy i love it and have watched it countless times and usually find out something new about it with each viewing br br i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people not rich people who live in either l a or new york well it is true except for pam br br travolta plays bud a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys good guys in big budget movies this is a really good movie the mechanical bull riding contest and two step dancing may be silly but you have to enjoy this for what it is br br bud meets sissy played by debra winger with slutty brilliance and soon after they are married and living in their dream trailer but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes bud wants to be a real cowboy sissy wants to be with a real cowboy but in modern times men's roles are not as clear where can bud prove he's a real man he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night he can be a urban cowboy but sissy wants to drive his pick up truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too so where does this leave bud as sissy asserts her independence she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex con and prison rodeo star a real bull rider wes played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn bud is threatened and bud and sissy break up br br sissy shacks up with wes who abuses her emasculating himself further bud becomes the boy toy of pam a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up pam doesn't do that kind of thing she writes a make up letter to bud but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy's housework br br bud's uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation but are too stubborn later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley's and you know bud is going to win pam realizes that bud doesn't love her but sissy he did it for her wes tries to rob gilleys but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy bud saves the day and wins back the woman he loves br br of course you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and live like pigs maybe that contributed to their bad marriage or why didn't bud stay with pam she wasn't that bad and had money or why they had to kill off uncle bob or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up marshall says to bud she sissy rides that bull better than you do but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit and saying isn't that bonnie raitt on the stage
<START> you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i'll take a stab at one now br br episode 'valentines pay' br br jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing wages she realizes 'her' mistake and the usual 'oh jim you're so lovely' the end br br another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk br br imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of human beings with tvs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you'd get an audience br br 'two and a half men' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious
