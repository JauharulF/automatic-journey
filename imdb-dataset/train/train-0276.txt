<START> i'll be short and to the point this movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature iq sorry liberals feminists etc no women will ever be a seal they can forget about the draft or being in combat too ain't going to happen you see hard as it is to understand or accept men and women are physically different regardless of the fact it is 2007 reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt men can't give birth or breast feed babies oh i forgot about san franfreako br br women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations how many women play in the nfl or nhl lastly i couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what i just wrote upsets you come to think of it if this does upset you that only warms my heart more i didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth this imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that
<START> there are two kinds of 1950s musicals first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast less famous music and second rate directors 'the girl can't help it' belongs to the latter category neither tom ewell or edmond o'brien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her well never mind seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela andersons the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for fats domino little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie if that music appeals to you this is worth watching if not don't bother
<START> this production was made in the middle 1980s and appears to be the first serious attempt to put bleak house on celluloid no film version of the novel was ever attempted it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other so that it would have been very hard to prune it down the novel was the only attempt by dickens to make a central narrator one of two in the work a woman esther summerson esther is raised by her aunt and uncle who in typical dickens style mistreat her she is illegitimate but they won't tell her anything about her parentage later we get involved with the gentry sir leicester dedlock and his wife lady honoria deadlock dame diana rigg is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor tulkinghorn peter vaughn we also are involved with the actions of richard carstone esther's boyfriend in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case jarndyce v jarndyce which everyone even richard's cousin john jarndyce played by desmond elliot warns is not worth the effort br br dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction starting with the breach of promise case in pickwick papers dickens looked closely at the law mr bumble said it was a ass in oliver twist and dickens would consistently support that view he looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in twist that the law barely tries to cure he attacks the chancery and outdated estate laws as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers tulkinghorn vholes in bleak house in little dorrit he attacks the debtors' prisons he had hit it also in david copperfield in our mutual friend he looks at testators and wills in the mystery of edwin drood he apparently was going to go to a murder trial dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries including thackeray br br but the novel also looks at other problems like charity and religious hypocrisy the budding scotland yard detective force social snobbery in the industrial revolution he also uses the novel to satirize various people leigh hunt the writer inspector fields of scotland yard and even the notorious maria manning most of these points were kept in this fine mini series version if it is shown again on a cable station catch it
<START> why can't more directors these days create horror movies like the shining there's an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time br br so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i mean br br this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary it's some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubrick's movies 2001 a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it br br finally i must comment on nicholson's legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top notch acting that must be seen to believe br br there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one r i p stanley
<START> once again pia zadora the woman who owes her entire career to her husband proves she can't act this disaster of a film butchers the harold robbins novel ray liotta must have been hogtied and carried to the set to appear in this one br br avoid this at all costs i doubt even doing the mst3k thing would save it
<START> i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time sabu was a real delight as was rex ingram as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad veidt who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet also june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an aaa
<START> this is a splendidly done simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different that they take from it the premise is simple an unnamed celebrity actor morgan freeman decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people he takes particular interest in the cashier at the 10 items or less lane paz vega who he finds an amiable strong and curious presence br br both actors play off each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study not a conventional character study they each represent entire worlds the cashier's life is mired in a harsh and frustrating real world while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he can't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers he readily admits he's putting on a face when he talks to people and the whole point of researching real people shows he's not one of them br br but not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work we see the reverse process as well several characters recognize him and make reference to how he has inspired them with his movie roles br br the cashier's favorite song al pasar la barca about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay ie do honest work for boat passage couldn't have been chosen better it parallels with the vega character the only store employee with any brains or ambition who is willing to work hard to succeed that's quite an aspiration for somebody who looks like paz vega it's an odd little film probably made on a shoestring if you don't mind slow pacing and a talky approach this film will entertain the characters are perfectly contrasted and the effective acting makes them endearing a nice watch
<START> i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films i've ever seen i've watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time that this film by itself could make up the entire curriculum of a post graduate course in film direction br br a long time ago film trailers used to promise it'll make you laugh it'll make you cry that's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what grand canyon does it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell br br much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror it's always a short step too just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius br br spoiler of sorts coming up after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesn't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat through an accidental self inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house in the moment of their relief argument forgotten cut finger forgotten the earthquake survived a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed the couple rushes to his aid i cried when i saw this sequence i cried every time i saw it i'm crying now it isn't sadness that does this to me it's not a particularly sad sequence what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect that's perfect astounding end of spoiler br br there's so much to say about grand canyon it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously they aren't showy or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully the film moves on at the pace of life even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience br br grand canyon is a very human film
<START> evil breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good the beginning of the film seems promising but overall it's a disaster the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting the acting is brutal and unbearable most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn't work because the characters become annoying some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them after about a half hour through the movie we get the first death other than in the beginning and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a sscrack none of it is funny it's just plain ridiculous the film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless most of the characters are clichÃ©d even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days evil breed isn't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it's main task watch texas chainsaw massacre just before dawn or see no evil for a real slasher
<START> a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through 96 minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn't build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn't really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can't decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don't even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br plot 0 10 characters 1 10 acting 2 10 overall 3 10 i feel like that's too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top
<START> i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because i think the wild women of wongo is worse this is an exercise in patience it's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist there's no plot there's no logic there is certainly no acting although the shark has some quality dialogue we don't wonder about anything we don't know how people got where they got it's always amazing to me how things like this even get released i agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad i know it's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection it's like a paperweight or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale it covers the crack in the wall

<START> i've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it this one ought to be a cult fave the best line your dress is deeply cool says the prince to cinderella kathleen turner shines as the stepmother i also like the 1950's era cars and motorcycles the melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler he tries to stay cool but fails to hide his love for the fairy tale princess to be her slipper is not glass truer to the original story but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne my only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get hopefully blockbuster or amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon
<START> i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases but this movie was just a dud period the premise was terrible the main character mary gordano alicia silverstone was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world also to make this movie more mysterious the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood especially in the warehouse br br once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to
<START> this movie makes me think the others i've seen with combs were an accident the plot had more holes than i think i've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a b movie the acting was so laughable that not even the memories of combs' past campy triumphs were enough to save it considering the script i have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas i am thoroughly upset that i paid blockbuster prices for this trash the fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of avoid this movie no matter what
<START> this movie is finally out on dvd in italy completely restored i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days 2003 when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship or the us for that matter i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beings br br back to the movie as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show off of machism the distortion of reality in that ever present radio chronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you shiver br br a masterpiece br br
<START> after too many bad memories i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence i recently watched it again just to remind me why i've always considered this the worst st tng episode with the exception of shades of gray which barely counts as an episode at all br br i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher show don't tell from deanna troi's pronouncement and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming dangerous rogue okona is to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is it isn't to the who cares resolution to the conflict there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple underlined for our edification and there ain't a believable moment in any of it unfortunately bill campbell a charming actor in other circumstances is too puppy dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot on the other hand it could be that no one short of john barrowman jack harkness from doctor who could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role br br zero points by the way to the data subplot while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way br br on a good day you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode me i'd rather skip ahead to time squared or q who
<START> brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often
<START> long before brokeback mountain about 23 years before deathtrap was the first time i ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen and frankly i was shocked i understood it in terms of the plot and it didn't really upset my sensibilities not much but it was the first time i ever saw it at least in a mainstream movie i thought it was a gutsy move for its time and took courage for them to try it especially christopher reeve in the midst of his time as pg rated superman male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with brokeback but it's interesting to note this much earlier incarnation
<START> this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we're not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools after the basic version download die hard fan here on a dial up modem eventually got here i hit my first snag media player mplayer classic winamp failed to open it on my xp box and then totem xine kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server mplayer managed to run it flawlessly going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it br br the film beautiful soundtrack superb lighting masterful camera work and flawless texturing everything looked real and then the two main characters moved and spoke and the movie died for me everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters except for proog in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut scenes that entail less realism than this br br any frame in the movie is fantastic as a frame and the thing is great if neither actors are moving i'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone i'd ruin my reputation br br oh and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot br br this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen
