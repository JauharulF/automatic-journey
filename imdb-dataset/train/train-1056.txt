<START> this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in 1936 i remember him playing in a great film lost weekend ray plays the role of michael stuart who is a very rich banker there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy they hire a man to pose as a very rich count his name is count ariszted misha auer who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture deanna durbin penny craig surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard the entire police department and convicts started applauding which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film this is deanna durbin's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm
<START> this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to greece br br anyway as for saif you'd expect a great performance but even he let down the people br br akshay kumar recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs he was sensational in this movie for only this performance filmfare should introduce another award the toiletries award for the worst performance by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat br br kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife to be dress like that but she must've impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked it br br i am forced to give it a 1 10 but i'd really give this movie a 0 10 an unachieved film
<START> i purchased the blood castle dvd on ebay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all i can say is that i wasn't disappointed with this purchase blood castle is one of those trashy european horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining for all the bad reasons the opening alone was worth the price of the dvd our heroine dr ivanna arrives at the castle where she's supposed to help a scientist baron dalmar who does experiments on dead tissue on her way to the castle 1 a man tries to rape ivanna 2 the castle's housekeeper fights with her 3 the maid wants her dead 4 and finally baron dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day hmm something tells me she's not welcome with such a miserable arrival you'd think ivanna would leave the place in a ny minute but no like so many great trashy films our headstrong heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy baron on that same eventful day the intro is so over the top trashy it's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that canadian film junior that i knew i was going to enjoy this br br but the fun doesn't end there ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night only to wake up from unconsciousness naked bound and tortured in mild sessions of s m by an unseen man even after experiencing these nightly s m sessions ivanna stays at the castle dully convinced by the angry baron that what she's experiencing are nothing more than dreams to be expected even after being treated so badly from the get go ivanna falls in love with the baron ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him including the obvious fact that the dour baron is popular with the young ladies every women at the castle it seems only women work there is in love with the miserable chump who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills and has been killing women basically the baron's physically disfigured brother igor is responsible for everything in a very long winded scene the brother warns the baron he should not get too involved with ivanna or he'll suffer the consequences so what do the baron and ivanna do about this well they get married of course during the very brief marriage ceremony the baron is shot by one of the angry locals father of one of the dead girls but all of this doesn't deter ivanna who amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them cheerfully comforts the hurt baron that it's just a flesh wound and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle where the killer rapist torturer brother is the whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts between ivana the baron and igor blame it all on love br br anyway you get the idea subtle it's not almost everything is over the top ridiculous in this film and when it's not ott such as the predictable climax things get a tad boring but for most of the film the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another i really love these kind of films everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer and populated by characters behaving illogically even those who made the retromedia dvd realize this and when you go to the scene selection section we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly br br the production values are beautifully risible the opening and closing credits with those candles and red curtains ah a soupÃ§on of class the music sounds sometimes like something from a tim burton film which only adds to the oddness of it all and customary to these kind of films when the young ladies take off their clothes they just beg to be killed br br as a standard film i rate this a 2 but as a it's so bad it's good film i rate it a solid 8 stars if you enjoy trashy films please watch this one it's a must see the only thing left for me to ponder about it what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle
<START> i saw a page of madness in a silent film course at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after 25 years truly ahead of its time perhaps even still this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness

<START> we all have seen some unending epics in our times but this one really tops them all the movie is so long and so slow that just to put things in perspective i felt a lot older when i left movie hall than i entered it at almost 4 hours length it could have rather been made into a tele serial br br what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them there is no interconnection between them to start with and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story br br situation is made worse by silly dialogues most of them repeated in hindi cinema over years and stupid cinematography br br priyanka doesn't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen an utter waste of beauty without acting skills br br and then there is loud is humorous govinda my face twists better than jim carrey akshay khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers br br only good part in movie is john vidya's love story nice acting comedy by sohail isha but they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines br br my guess director was making two separate movies may be more and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records beyond a point of sorting them out so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie br br watch it only if you want to test your patience
<START> thanks to warner archive i can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink the bathtub however is present this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some it is because they were big in the silent days and most faded with the popularity of the talkies there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well you will be most impressed with winnie lightner who performs two numbers also there is that french star irene bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two strip technicolor chinese fantasy which has been restored for this version it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas finally there is the massive lady luck finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour this is truly an epic of the early talkie era any old movie buff will love this
<START> br br how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me the script is so banal and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed demi moore however shows none a surprise by participating in this film if one looks at her tracklist all in all a high concept style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of
<START> in black mask jet li plays a bio engineered super killer turned pacifist who has to fight against other super killers bad plot bad sfx 60 million dollar budget but the fighting scenes were excellent jet li is the greatest martial arts star alive
<START> was this movie stupid yup did this movie depth nope character development nope plot twists nope this was simply a movie about a highly fictionalized springer show it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv molly hagan did a great job as jaime pressly's mom jaime is well gorgeous this flick wasn't so much made to be a breakthrough movie rather it was intended to life in a trailer park i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie where everyone sleeps with everyone else all the girls get pregnant by different guys and all the guys drive rusted out '66 ford pickups exaggeration of course but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park some people over analyze movies case in point star trek freaks i watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene read the goofs bit about connie's shirt could it have been better sure but it was funny as hell
<START> i have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new dukes movie is a modernized version oh please if this is what you consider modernized then hollywood can keep it many people on the msn site have also said that and i quote you old fogies need to get over it and except it as is well let me tell you something i am 24 so i am a long way from being and old fogie and i won't get over it it was a disgrace to all that is hazzard county the only thing right in the movie title was hazzard was all the profanity smoking and drinking really necessary the cast was terrible jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly i believe it has all gone to her head she is in no way a daisy duke a fluke maybe but definitely no duke i love sean williams scott but not as bo they should have included the original cast as at least cameos but even hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script i mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks
<START> so far nightmares and dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing the first segment directed by brian henson may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares but at least it was well directed suspenseful and visually interesting with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini series br br however the second story in the series was just dreadful and not in the good way the screenplay is bad requiring the shallow unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky unnecessary exposition the acting is overdone and unconvincing and i felt far more empathy for a cold blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky but with the amateurish acting and writing the end result looks like a freshman year film school project with camera moves for their own sake and little in the way of plot or tension br br if the rest of the series continues like this i'll be sorely let down i look forward to william h macy's installment and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way
<START> the dubbing translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i haven't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 and i've seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could re edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars it's just that funny br br but if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs
<START> what the bleep do we know was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies it was less of a movie and more of an after school special but at the same time nothing special at all the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic which almost anyone will tell you marlee matlin in her underwear just shouldn't happen i won't dwell on it what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate this movie while tedious also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning it was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative become a creator of your life manifestation of abundance shoeless piece of propaganda interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence however the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds it completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us which seems to be more the case or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us in this way the movie was inappropriately solipsistic solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're god almighty if you are you will be impressed by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do if not you will be sorely disappointed a moron or perhaps both also the title is so ridiculous i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name shame on everyone involved
<START> i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival br br it's a real cheapo prod nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both br br think larry cohen br br sean young is an interesting actor well done to the producers for hooking her i guess br br the opening scene in the space ship coming down is hilarious you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around br br ha ha but i wish the people who made this well at least it's not pretentious
<START> between 1937 and 1939 twentieth century fox made a ton of mr moto films however towards the end of the series it was obvious that the studio had jumped the shark so to speak this phrase indicates that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula for example with the brady bunch they introduced the annoying 'cousin oliver' and with family ties they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season with the moto films they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re tooled in the previous film warren hymer played an annoying wrestler and in this film the character archibald featherstone appears featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever as you kept hoping someone preferably moto would kill him just to shut him up although he's supposed to work for the famed scotland yard he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip again and again his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon act it's so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better moto films due to its clever plot br br as for the plot the crown of the queen of sheba is discovered in the opening scene moto now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen in a great twist several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other br br overall the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the moto series should have ended here with wwii approaching the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the us or in allied countries
<START> ok you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's more than any movie i has ever seen the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human never dull and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion mini mogul darren stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world what he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age what does change mean without reflection i love this movie
<START> the russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl br br 4 i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here br br despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes 4 is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs
