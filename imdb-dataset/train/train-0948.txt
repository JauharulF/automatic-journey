<START> another of my delves into the bargain bin this movie gave me exactly what i expected a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies br br it all started so well i liked the little intro with the newsreel about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire br br from then onwards the film descended into outright silliness and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character the ability to light one's own farts without the aid of a match it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment that'll be good you can almost hear them say as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant well br br the movie came across as cheap tat if you pay more than Â£1 50 for it you've been done
<START> besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is 1 stanley kubrick 2 god allmighty 3 the rest this movie actually is better than the book and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat considering the director the flawless filming stile the acting and kubrick's all time number one skill the music make it the masterpiece of horror i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it it blew me away it is far better than i ever imagined it it starts slow kubrick trademark and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless a trend that i hate in recent day horror films just watch it
<START> this movie started slowly then gained momentum towards the middle however the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak the second part really got interesting but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending playing football in the yard really could it get any more sappy and maudlin now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s i won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like the '60s
<START> what a lovely heart warming television movie the story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope her mother is also very distressed only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness which all viewers hope will materialise samantha mathis is brilliant as the little girl's mum as she was as the nanny in jack and sarah worth watching if you like both samantha mathis and happy year tear jerking movies ellen burstyn is as always a delightful grandmother in this tender and magnificently acted movie jodelle ferland the little five year old is charming and a most convincing young actress the film is based on a true story which makes it so touching mermaid is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in mermaid gives us all hope by realising that there a lot of lovely people in the world with lot's of love to give james robson glasgow scotland u k
<START> no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for the house next door from her 1970s novel of the same title or someone else did it this lifetime like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough having read the book a long time ago we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials which of course one can't find in this version we watched br br the film's star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body ms boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy the character at the center of the mystery this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better br br the film has a feeling of a cross between desperate houswives with the stepford wives and other better known features combined with a mild dose of creepiness the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting
<START> i saw myra breckinridge when it first came out in 1970 i was a healthy 20 year old at the time who loved movies and really liked raquel welsh on top of that i had read the gore vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny i saw the movie at a local drive in and about half way through i was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe i'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie it wasn't smart or trendy it was gross and sloppy all the actors were tone deaf and the director didn't have the slightest idea what he was doing the casting of mae west was one of the worst casting choices in movie history as one reviewer here said her role had nothing to do with the movie or book her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud which would never do for the legendary ms west oh no the plot is changed so she sexually beats him up very believable from a 77 year old woman who looks every day of her age i could go on but why it was an awful movie br br bluto
<START> kristine watts molie weeks is broken apart missing her lover she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past she hires a stranger douglas davis and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end br br the first point that impresses in the cure is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen last but not the least the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better my vote is nine br br title brazil not available
<START> i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels br br seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it was br br i'm certainly happy it was'nt kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slow mo replays detracts from the moment br br this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner alien silent running logan's run or thx1138 were however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time br br he changes in the movie to a believable degree he does'nt crack arnie one liners he does'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending br br that's why this film did'nt do well it did'nt follow formula and among a 18 25 year old target american audience that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see br br fear and discipline br br always
<START> there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for well let's see we learn he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities he treats his coworkers like cattle gets them involved in his own personal crisis in the process getting one of them killed jeopardizes the safety of his kids threatens his ex wife's new boyfriend tries to strong arm the police and school administrators and all this for what because he was thinking with his little head i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp it would have made for a far more satisfying ending
<START> to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in 1972 so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series left behind ' which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over 30 years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you don't like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
<START> i still can't believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap this movie is worse than deadly friend the plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull i don't know why wes craven hates his debut last house on the left an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes probably this turkey don't get me wrong i really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this
<START> an ok flick set in mexico about a hit man scott glenn who hitches a ride with struggling american writer and his mexican girlfriend after a hit he pays them to take him to the border Â but things get out of hand br br it starts well enough but quickly struggles and dies br br spoiler br br the eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe an absence of passion and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other made it ridiculous and the ending was predictable and dull br br end spoiler br br harvey keitel is the us agent on the hit man's trail but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is
<START> la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access br br this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale i must advice that this is not a sample film br br please enjoy
<START> sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce iranian style' which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon africa what's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn't served anymore with these 2 behind the bench they often carry out maximum penalties ya you go girl
<START> in where the sidewalk ends otto preminger reunites dana andrews and gene tierney surely in hopes of recapturing the magic of his laura but they're wildly dissimilar films set in different strata of new york not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe a fine mist of the gothic hovers over the upscale manhattan of laura with its erotic obsession and faint whiff of necrophilia where the sidewalk ends is pure urban soot and grit befouling a town of basement apartments steam rooms and parking garages br br but it's every bit as fine a movie as its revered forerunner and dyed in the wool noir laura by contrast one of the clutch of films from 1944 which the french first dubbed noir ' was still very much a sophisticated murder mystery daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance and director of photography joseph lashelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones the docks and the el this is quintessential big city specifically big apple noir like several others from the bumper crop of 1950 like side street and sleeping city and the tattooed stranger and edge of doom br br as the movie opens police detective dana andrews is on the carpet for his brutal ways particularly his vendetta towards crime boss gary merrill whom we learn was set up in business by andrews' ne'er do well father when an out of towner is stabbed to death at a floating crap game operated by merrill the hair trigger andrews roughs up a witness causing him a fatal crack to the skull exacerbated by a steel plate installed in the veteran's head realizing that his job's already on the line andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder br br of course that's far from an end to it the corpse is discovered his estranged wife turns out to be tierney and all the evidence starts to turn toward her father tom tully a hack driver who happened not only to have been cruising the same mean streets the night of the murder but to have ample reason to want his abusive son in law dead but the embittered loner andrews finds in tierney a summons to his better nature he tries to exonerate her father while still keeping his own involvement in the whole sordid business a secret br br not so epigrammatic as laura the script for where the sidewalk ends by ben hecht shows a pungency of its own in a second dressing down his superior tells andrews look at you all bunged up like a barrelhouse fag' br br but while laura spread its attention over half a dozen characters here andrews is all but the sole focus even tierney's role is far less central than her half spectral laura and andrews may never have excelled his performance here it's tight lipped and taciturn but never more eloquent than when his face is silently registering the anguish to which his own obstinacy has brought him he's a pent up sufferer who can find release only through the safety valve of violence he even lashes out against his loyal partner bert freed to be sure he finds too swift a road to redemption though the agency of his beautiful co star but that was the style of the times and a sweetened up ending does little to undermine this new york story of violence corruption and urban entanglements
<START> are you kidding me a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal how talented do you have to be to do this she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half hour stomach churning painful production i know she has a martha stewart esquire empire so does warren buffett but i don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo br br she has a nephew named brycer brycer stop talking about anyone a name that stupid br br more time is spent on table scapes than actual cooking who has that kind of time silicon should be on your spatula not on my tv this show should be on cartoon network not food network
<START> the star of this film is the screenplay attention to detail for the period in dress language social mores we don't hurt women and the politics are remarkable it is a reminder of kosovo to day the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step a great film
<START> let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies it's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married ben arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham fisted trademark mraovich that you can't possibly take any of them seriously arthur's brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly over the top evil effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role that's because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally you suck at writing directing acting and casting that's the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man
<START> ever this is the bottom i am not joking the theater should've had a warning of some kind 'abandon all hope ye who enter here' would've been fitting br br i don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes br br i remember when the wayans's were funny i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate i'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon br br i disliked nearly everything about this movie i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body what i did like was the ending not the movie's resolution but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out br br i gave this movie one star but it clearly deserves less i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it br br when are people going to learn if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film avoid it at all costs you have been warned
<START> i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx beyonce knowles danny glover the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy anika noni rose and jennifer hudson br br eddie murphy's james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent br br jamie foxx and beyonce knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ray performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film br br the movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song beyonce's heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long br br dh vancouver wa
