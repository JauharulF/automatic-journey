<START> saw this 'film' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with coolio totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached worse than spawn long live evil dead ii
<START> while in a plane flicking through the large choice of movies i came across live almost accidentally oh boy what a choice br br i remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show now i can easily say this has been a hell of a ride i don't remember last time i have been so excited terrified not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can't turn away from the screen literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you've got br br you will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show you will drift from thinking how come the human being can be so vicious to why not after all ask yourself would you do it then learn about the contestants their motives and start guessing you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe br br good acting good directing with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more br br spoilers couple of things i would have changed br br the casting of the contestants i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him the idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid it felt like you didn't care about some of the contestants although this might have been done on purpose i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants game rules a big glitch br br what happens if the 5th contestants doesn't die when he pulls the trigger do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself they should have given a chance to all contestants to live ie if 5th is a blank too then no one dies br br interestingly i haven't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time just wish i had some popcorn with me
<START> it seems like this is the only film that john saxon ever directed and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera this movie is a dog from start to finish and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it a viet nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself the war hero framed and sent to prison death row specifically now this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine a zombie of course everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore this just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself and i stopped it before the end which seemed like it was coming a few times but no it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path if one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves so don't risk it 2 out of 10
<START> went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend the place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines i knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than i thought it would be i liked both edward furlong and christina ricci they seemed really weird just like normal people if that makes sense i get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people like jock or geek or cheerleader etc both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to i will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on dvd go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life i plan to see it again in the theater and i don't go see things more than once very often
<START> and my children love it now granted i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great and that the plot is trite hey if every villian introduced themselves by saying i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt i think they might be laughed at but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music br br music so catchy mind you that i still had the words memorized after not seeing this film in twenty years i would definitely suggest this one for younger children
<START> shirley maclaine in another tailor made role as the aunt to a single mom in a 1962 working class chicago neighborhood the veteran character actress gets another work out as a gutsy woman who won't let any set backs defeat her spirit of success the children a pre teen boy and girl are drawn to their spirited aunt zoe although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them expelled from school br br the plot is cleverly enveloped in the cuban missile crisis with all of the social implications men building bomb shelters people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only tv set at a diner and a general mist of uneasiness and fear in the air when a harmless miracle is blown out of proportions the climactic conclusion nonetheless makes the viewer feel good yes virginia the sun will come up tomorrow clearly a small budget production this is still a sweet little film filled with the magic that sunday matinees were made of with a few choice oldies thrown into an effective sound track the whole family is sure to enjoy this one
<START> this is of of sammo's great early comedy films this isn't a parody of enter the dragon the main character sammo is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble then fighting oh the fighting good fast paced scenes with high impact the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammo's kicks br br the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional there is a jim kelly looking guy one of three experts hired to take out sammo but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro wig come on didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978 well i guess i've seen enough white fake as hell chinese people in old american movies too br br this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan
<START> i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo and his was easily the stand out the film's three stories it wasn't my favorite of the shorts but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features i've seen a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic though he's classified as a neo nouvelle vogue his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives his movies are closer to jean vigo in l'atlante jean cocteau and guy maddin than godard and truffaut br br in boy meets girl carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like vigo's movies br br the story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to carax's two following films which comprise this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis lavant who plays a character named alex in carax's next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment but avoids contacting either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a suicidal young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part limelight br br later he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourself young people today it's like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film and how an actor timid off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera heres where the movie tips its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it overlaps the style of the film silent and expressionist with the content a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in love br br there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as carax is self reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining infants he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence br br though indebted to films before talkies carax is a master of music knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy's holiday in cambodia or an early david bowie song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl softly humming br br in boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet michel gondry and wes anderson whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional cues in these carax movies br br every line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level some i lack words to articulate there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can wait see this first if i were to make films i would want them to be like this in fact i wish all films were like this where the ephemeral becomes larger than life and life itself becomes a dream
<START> dana andrews is one of those actors that i've probably seen in a dozen films but who has never really registered for me often stolid taciturn playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated glenn ford he's an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate but once you hit the right film br br and this is it preminger's moody look at new york's underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir and andrews is in his element as too tough cop mark dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules early on in the film he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who dixon hates for personal reasons and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of justice along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed gene tierney and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder br br stunningly photographed by joseph lashelle with hard and sparkling dialogue by ben hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite preminger film thus far it's every bit as good as the more heralded laura
<START> return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene you'll have some movie quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect br br i think it's worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you haven't seen the original cbtl you'll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one
<START> the original show was so much better they should have left on a good note this movie killed the whole idea it was boring over dramatic and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel not to mention that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again so sorry tyler perry but try harder next time this movie is just kinda dull and not that funny either sorry 4 10 stars is it br br jay addison
<START> this showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4 5 i gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars after reading the viewer comments i was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy yeah i see that imdb lists it as comedy drama under genre that sure is misleading isn't it fortunately i saw the movie before logging onto this website so i did not have that expectation in fact based on the synopsis of what i heard i fully expected it to simply be a drama i'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes br br another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character driven' 'driving miss daisy' is an example of another character driven movie that comes to mind someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial tom's danny glover work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie that is how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family or his personal troops if you will however they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to greenwich and move 'up' in the world br br tom's obsession became a compulsion he proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood his chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color it was because of everything the 'interloper' represented everything that tom had left behind in essence tom had become an oreo cookie black on the outside but white on the inside br br the last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written directed and acted by whoopi goldberg i have ever had the pleasure to witness i realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door don't want to give it away the climax is verbal and whoopi delivers it i am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs tom which college tom two is going to or when she releases it all in the middle of the night and tom wakes up nevertheless the denouement is great you know that life on that street will never be the same br br my favorite kind of character driven flick people go through problems some pain do their dance they grow they change and life goes on as an audience member i may learn something or be inspired
<START> if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following br br 1 look through the tv listings 2 find the movie 'men in white' 3 when 'men in white' comes on sit and watch br br and that's it after sitting through two hours of bad puns dreadful and not that funny movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why br br why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasn't br br but on the other hand if you're old enough to remember power rangers you might spot some familiar faces during the film presumably to save on production costs saban who also make power rangers decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone's favourite tacky toy spawning franchise throughout the film i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value br br but if you want to see actual power rangers monsters go watch power rangers itself it's much better than this piece of garbage and that's saying something
<START> well i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all to me amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies he was a die hard villain a no apologies villain to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way br br the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast there i think maybe the director could have done better but to be honest the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel she is an unsung heroine a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahi's wife she may be given little to do but she does everything with total conviction i'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience br br so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average you won't get much out of this movie but if you constantly search for something more then this might give you some of what you've been missing
<START> this is why i still have nightmares br br this terrifying film a musical was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s br br a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island the mayor of the island pufnstuf allegedly a dragon looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch billie halliday who was considered 'a bit of alright' at the time br br the flute is recovered at an 'interesting' witches convention with the witches having a gay old time the boy dresses in drag then as a 'fairy' to recover the flute br br not suitable for children
<START> this is an odysessy through time via computer animation supposedly th work of over 300 artists made in the late '80s and released in 1990 this was cutting edge stuff for the day i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots br br most of the short scenes made no sense just forms evolving into other forms but that was fun to watch this is all about visuals not really about any kind of a story there were some strange sequences in which odd looking men creatures would dance around with birds overheard all of it is computer animated which was new back then even the term computer animated was not well known br br it's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes no words just pictures with electronic music stoners must have really loved this br br it's a nice intriguing 40 minutes of eye candy and head candy by today's cg effects this may have lost impact but i think you'd still be entertained by this
<START> this is in my opinion a very good film especially for michael jackson lovers it contains a message on drugs stunning special effects and an awesome music video br br the main film is centered around the song and music video 'smooth criminal ' unlike the four minute music video it is normal speed and in my opinion much easier to watch br br the plot is rather weird however michael jackson plays a magical 'gangster' that when he sees a shooting star he transforms into a piece of machinery throughout the film he transforms into a race car a giant robot and a space ship br br the robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange i found it a little out of whack compared to the rest of the film br br a child is kidnapped michael tries to save her is tortured and beaten and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys a little weird yeah br br but besides the bizarre robot scene it's a very good movie and any michael jackson fan will enjoy both the smooth criminal music video and the movie
<START> the movie was totally awesome and cool the graphics was superb and it was amazing especially flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie hopper was a pure and perfect villain even dot was cute when the bird comes to eat the bugs that scene was superb and good even the last scene was awesome and cool even flik's inventions was good building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers when the ants are building the artificial bird that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of a bug's life
<START> tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death when he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments he chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution they can have whatever the want in the room within reason but they can't leave after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100 after some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can't sleep one day a 'witch' come into their cell albeit a glassed off portion what happens next i'll let you find out i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up it was intriguing to me now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher br br my grade c br br media blaster's 2 dvd set extras disc 1 director's cut trailers for versus aragami attack the gas station and deadly outlaw rekka disc 2 theatrical cut commentary with hideo sakaki ryuhei kitamura sakaguchi takuand tsutomu takahashi cast and crew interview making of original trailer and promo teasers
<START> this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day to day economic conditions during the 30's remember 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then so this was a minor luxury for many people it's testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type cast in similar movies e g james cagney william powell ruby keeler frank mchugh joan blondell and guy kibbee then too branches of the u s military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer busby berkeley at the end
