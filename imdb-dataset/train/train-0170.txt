<START> i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then it's become one of my favorites the plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment it's chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you're looking for a good comedy i'd definately recommend this movie
<START> this splendidly directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm it is a first class adventure for many reasons i suggest fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulated jungle locales and a very exciting storyline johnny weissmuller plays tarzan a mono syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative as jane parker his wife who had been jane porter in the novels maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality the effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back lot which really works the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated one is harry holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave tarzan tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized king king the group claim to want to hunt animals and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephant's graveyard but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephant filled scene he saves jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband the film was directed by set design wizard cedric gibbons and quite beautifully too his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish neil hamilton is a very good harry paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally an unusual and well realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well recommended
<START> earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement the character development in newer movies just isn't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be depending on the film s in question this can be attributed to a number of things sometimes generic special effects and plot driven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds but in the case of over the top uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema it's movies like dog days that are to blame br br i normally have a very high tolerance for movies no matter how dull or pointless i find them ranging from good long ones like andrei rublev and dogville to ones i've considered painful to sit through a la alpha dog and wild wild west i shut this movie off 45 minutes in which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have i wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism in an attempt to say something about the dregs of society this film too easily falls into being self indulgent trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense granted i've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people happiness gummo kids salo storytelling irreversible that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality dog days had none more than an eighth grader's distaste for society choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are and instead choosing to be a dull awful and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art this isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society it's just boring and nothing worth caring about
<START> i've noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how wholesome and entertaining it is these people need to get out of the house more often i don't know why they're shilling for this vapid insipid brainless piece of fluff pat boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his co star pamela austin a former model yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day a good supporting cast terry thomas edward everett hortyon among others tries hard to make some sense out of this but to no avail i noticed that two directors shared credit although credit isn't the word i would use neither is director as for wholesome entertainment there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this find one of those films and skip this one
<START> the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle complicates the story some br br this really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either br br while i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone it's bad and not in a so bad that it is good kind of way
<START> the trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be this movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be kidman being one of my favorites of course i'm biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better three out of four stars 9 5 02
<START> i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years it really is a fun little film with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it arkin shines as always check it out you won't be dissappointed by the way it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging it is widescreen the transfer is rather poor but at least the whole movie is visible
<START> this film is really bad with a script full of 'memorable' lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad not the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole film br br all in all one of the worst films i have ever seen
<START> there have been far too few mainstream films set in post colonial africa and the ones that have are a mixed bunch this one with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s shows the best and worst values of africa which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole it also has shortcomings given the undue influence of western pre conceptions of africans and especially arabs br br dr anansa linderby the beautiful african american wife of the english doctor david linderby is captured by arab slave traders along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy the lead slave trader suleiman is every bit the stage arab with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match which would not be out of place on carry on follow that camel but are not up the standard this film deserves peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one dimensional character br br continuing the stereotypical theme all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen br br one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat david then meets two stereotypical white ex pats an englishman walker played by rex harrison and an american sandell played by william holden sandell is a mercenary with conventional views on mixed race relationships who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front won over by david's love for anansa and conscious of his own inability to find love he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms his helicopter is shot down but david survives br br we then see david introduced to malik kabir bedi an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman br br in one of the most heart rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier br br later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen anansa on her part and despite the scepticism of the boy manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees br br by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market br br suleiman now in no doubt that anansa is trouble attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince omar sharif who is corrupt but intelligent on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u n the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film br br at the slave market the young boy is sold to a middle aged german paedophile and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered wunderbar when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch doctoring skills br br david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter sweet ending from malik's point of view br br ultimately david and anansa are re united and malik whose life is in ruins can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed br br the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting
<START> greetings again from the darkness this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it doesn't measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspense br br charlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl sienna miller and agrees to fetch her a fallen star who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our star is wearing lots of bad chasing the good br br along the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see including any from the carribbean robert deniro plays captain shakespeare tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs br br not your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughn's layer cake effort deserves an audience sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money my guess it will find big success on video
<START> emily watson's natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italy's lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wasted br br so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64 square yet multi dimensional framework in one setting br br i did not read nabakov's book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry as game movie barry levinson's the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zero sum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit br br pure love as personified by emily watson's natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it br br this is a magnificent movie 10 10
<START> awful movie it's a shame that a few of flanders's top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor film br br there is barely something changed since the first movie and the tv series same actors same prototype characters same scenario emotional complications the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tip top after a predictable grand finale another constant fact in the work of jan verheyen is the exaggerated product placement company logo's on the team's shirt and along side the pitch ok but two times a commercial by one of the characters about an internet provider is just over the top br br meanwhile rumour has it about the making of a second series for flanders commercial tv station 'vtm' coincidental or not the station where jan verheyen is programmation manager since a few months br br to conclude and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to team spirit 2
<START> frustrating to watch because of one man's stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation
<START> honestly i was expecting to hate this one and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace the group of post teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one first off there is plenty wrong with evil breed the acting dialog is pretty weak and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson chasey lain ginger lynn and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna's role in this production is grossly over hyped as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time even less with chasey and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown on screen not bad for the first 5 minutes the other kill scenes are pretty inventive including jenna's forced breast implant removal a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass a knife through the face and a few other notables the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em so to speak also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps overall evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected this one along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films i usually steer clear of them as a whole but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith evil breed is no masterpiece but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it i know i was and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience 7 5 10
<START> tulip is on the australian all shorts video from tribe first rites showcasing the talents of first time directors br br i wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue br br i hope rachel griffiths has more stories to tell she does it so well
<START> for a comedic writer woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development there are a few entertaining moments but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls br br will ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery amanda peet did well but again didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie the movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried radha mitchell did it br br if you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion then you'll love this movie
<START> if this film was a comedy i would have given it a 10 oh my where do i begin put it this way i've seen lots of terrible horror films but this one makes troll 2 look like freakin' saving private ryan it's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy then went back to horror and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno softcore at that everything about this film is simply terrible the musical score someone shoot the guy who invented the yamaha keyboard the script the directing the cinematography the acting there simply are no words to describe this oh wait yes there are holy
<START> i've never been to paris but after seeing paris je t'aime i'm crazy to visit this city i've been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city there's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own can't you find love in new york
<START> pialat films people in extreme emotional situations usually with several violent scenes in la gueule ouverte he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer in a nos amours the teenage girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex con her motivation is a little cloudy since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows on the other hand he's got a fabulous body i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique he would have been great as a rugby player br br the casting is impressive isabelle huppert isn't allowed to give a bland inexpressive performance she has given many depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want see the scene in the bar where he's stabbed in the gut runs away and seeks treatment then soon restarts with nelly guy marchand with those coal black eyes and distressed look plays nelly's husband beautifully it's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre
<START> the crush is a pleasant enough 40 something friends romantic chick flick for the first two thirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city br br i particularly enjoyed the turn around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of br br they sure make a lot more deal of young man older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglas zeta jones or dion svengali nuptials br br surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tart tongued anna chancellor br br the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writer director is male here first timer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad f cker's club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obvious br br originally written 4 6 2002
