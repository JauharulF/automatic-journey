<START> hi br br my name is jessica i'm italian br br some time ago i have seen this film ' for the very first time' with corin corky nemec it was the story of micheal and mary margaret i need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in micheal's bedroom br br in italy this film hasn't been programmed for many years and i don't know how to find the song a lot of thanks for who can help me i love this film is very romantic the soundtrack is beautiful i love cheryl pollack jessica
<START> it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film but the problem is that it's not very good there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them br br rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films but alas that is what one must do on its own it's not very good and compared to others it's still not very good but it is not without its good points i liked the plot it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well br br however in the end the film fails to impress the characters are pretty much non existent and we don't care for any of them any of them might die but it's possible to pinpoint the final survivor from very early on
<START> i've seen this movie when i was young and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy so in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie to my surprise the movie held to my every expectations it's a great movie emotional in the right amount some jokes nice songs not great though and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical and all in all a great use to my time i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie which i first saw in the second grade made me cry today just like it made me cry then maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not but the important thing is that it made me feel and that's why filmmakers make films that and the money of course yes there are continuity glitches yes the script has holes but it doesn't matter the movie itself is fun and smart so don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life because nothing is perfect and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect it gets 10 simply because it made me feel
<START> horrendous pillaging of a classic br br it wasn't written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives etc this in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken identity murder game later on which in itself is also ridiculous 'so and so is the real killer plus her as well also him there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending br br it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again but that's about the only small pleasure to be had it's definitely not a patch on hitchcock and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr what a cast not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din drama action adventure and comedy all rolled up into one the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears if you haven't seen it i'd strongly recommend it
<START> not a bad martial arts film fight scenes were good michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme story worked without foul language and too much blood screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre she likes the art and having strong women promenant it was definitely worth watching i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers
<START> think of a no budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you'll get 'power play ' the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie br br this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake the rather cavalier reporter going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults br br unfortunately there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em ups plus earthquake disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story it might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong doing afoot it is formulaic but at least it would've been entertaining
<START> through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze a not particularly talented director has helmed a not particularly good movie yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits if for nothing more than to see what happens next br br a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame after capturing her even though she came willingly and threatening her into having sex another event she was also willing to do he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past he then decides to kill her huh but is foiled and dies instead the girl's mind snaps or something like that and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement br br alright the writing sucks it's long winded loaded with ten cent words and there is way too much of it br br the acting sucks what a minute what acting br br the filming sucks home video is bad enough but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult br br and the budget is a joke get it 'budget' that was the punchline br br and yet there was a charm to the thing back in the 70's these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them not in this day and age though if you want to watch this kind of violent sexually exploitive trash don't lie some of us do then this is all your gonna get nowadays br br some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene torture with fecal material fun with axes anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu br br it's not good and it won't be remembered but not since the heyday of joe d'amato have people made movies like this br br 4 10
<START> somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for casablanca didn't he or didn't he maybe there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood and i'm not too fond of casablanca anyway wait a minute yes there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood that's the one who wrote casablanca no matter i'll put as much care into this comment as howard w koch put into this production which is to say only a little br br you know what this sounds like somebody read cliff's notes on shakespeare's king lear and decided since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending br br there are differences lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear but in the play lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating kids can do that to you take my kid for instance after all the effort i squandered on raising him does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer no in the end everybody in the play dies br br in the movie evidently the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself somebody jumps in and saves her so the ending is more or less happy that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself
<START> unlike other commentaries i found this film fascinating even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors br br being a technologist i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic experiments are being conducted now to do just this i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage with results so far not favorable br br the characters in the movie are well cast the girl although overacting a bit looks suitable dumb the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers the minister conveys doubt at first the principal investigator tells the minister that him the minister is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god but the minute when the chips are down he falls back on his faith only the phd plays the zombie the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters in the face of death they react as real human beings would br br the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government as strictly a thriller the movie does not have enough thrills as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating
<START> i agree that capital city should be on dvd i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in i can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes i liked william armstrong as hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series when they aired this show in the new york city area it was always late at night or at off times the show is less than an hour long i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress julia phillips lane in the previous season i felt this show took chances and often it worked it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british i liked watching julia ormond in an early role i felt this show should have lasted longer i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america
<START> washington square is a flat shabby adaptation of the short novel by henry james indeed the novel is very good but far from the level of james' masterpieces moreover its simple eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film although william wyler with his the heiress gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel br br anyway the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great american writer in the novel the heroine catherine is shy not very attractive and somewhat clumsy but nonetheless she is a sound intelligent young woman and she's not as naive as it may seem her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful with no morbid sides in it along three quarters of the movie catherine jennifer jason leigh just seems to be mentally retarded poor thing in the last quarter she suddenly and incredibly becomes intelligent aware of her dignity as a woman and all that br br the director agnieszka holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story the first when the nervous child catherine has well troubles with her vesica the second scene when we see on the background a sort of open air brothel with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents and so on nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of henry james it is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the victorian age i defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of james' huge literary production i really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes br br yes i know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel but if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author here henry james i don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie br br the acting is adequate to the movie poor and flat in spite of the talent of albert finney and maggie smith washington square is definitely a non recommendable film
<START> while some performances were good victoria rowell adrienne barbeau and the two italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was handled clumsily at best and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes not as real people i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb very disappointed in this movie and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it based on the faulty connection to garden state which is a far funnier more inventive and touching movie than this one i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church which was so wooden and by the numbers that i nearly left and some in the audience actually did that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened i really don't like being misled to spend my money so uselessly
<START> the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie a blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere this is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary if it is meant to be a thriller drama this is too dull and monotonous in either case what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience that around us there are people who ill treat others who are willing to be ill treated that there are many crazy lunatics around us so so what
<START> this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne's mysterious island the sound editing is pretty bad you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w this film is full of flaws you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress ok now stand up as for the other characters there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien the alien guy talks with a deep voice when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice as for the special effects man this was brett piper's early work for crying out loud the creatures are good but the animation is jerky really jerky sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time 1955 the special effects are imaginative thge music is good bottom line this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget a must watch for aspiring film makers
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers who did pretty good for newbies but over all the movie was not believable br br with all of the gunfire you would think the police would have intervened even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug was not realistic br br looks like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get a better writer br br the count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean he'd be out of bullets once i can believe but not twice br br actually billy's character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like a comedy bad bad bad
<START> this did for crime what not another teen movie did for school i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's
<START> the story by norman maclean is a masterwork redford's film is a mediocrity he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story the cipher brad pitt trying to play the charismatic paul maclean a genius outdoors proves either risible or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful also tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine as men were once expected to be none of the women make an impression in the film which is regrettable because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear even poetic
<START> twelve monkeys 's got all the elements to become terry gilliam's masterpiece an outstanding screenplay a sustained rhythm clever sometimes ironic dialogs moreover he had a good nose about the cast twelve monkeys is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies here a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero as it was the case in die hard no matter how he tries he's a prisoner of the time the movie contains a very thrilling end too it's got a real dramatic power but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man the dangers he dreads notably the ones that could cause the end of the world and here these are virus that can create illnesses no matter how long it will take twelve monkeys will be estimated at its true value one of the masterpieces made in the nineties
<START> good lord and that coming from an atheist this movie is bad br br much has already been said by the reviewers before the ones who rated this piece 3 and below to which i fully agree i just like to add a few things br br among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products got chopped up by an axe raped by a broomstick had their balls blown away the ex boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table as do we but at least we have the mercy of the mute button br br had the director cut out the point and endless graveyard and inverted scenes our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes br br the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily haack's tits one point br br forget it don't buy it don't waste your time and your sanity my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the urgent need to watch and suffer scrapbook right now
