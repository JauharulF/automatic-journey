<START> throughly enjoy all the musical numbers each time i see this movie never seem to tire of it fred and ginger are always a pleasure to watch seeing lucy and betty grable before they hit the big time is fun to watch
<START> ruth gordon at her best this episode is my favorite of the whole columbo series peter falk and ruth gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame regardless of the rest of their work even the music was outstanding in this episode
<START> if i hadn't read his name on the dvd cover i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave in fact the film is so far from that that i wonder if back in the 50s and 60s new wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film it's so so unreal and it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films this isn't necessarily a bad thing just a very surprising thing br br what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film especially when there are so many better french musicals out there the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit i was going to puke br br the bottom line is that like american musicals not every french musical is gold this film is not another les parapluies de cherbourg umbrellas of cherbourg or huit femmes eight women and despite the presence of audrey tautou i can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity
<START> there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly especially around halloween time john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film and is a very well known one so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it
<START> after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of 'die hard on a ' movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career br br cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs br br you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent rex linn as travers br br he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death br br mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you can't help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking br br so forget your better judgement who cares if 'that could never happen' lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you're looking for qaulen he's the one wearing the helicopter
<START> highly memorable intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of french movies' true geniuses the formidably able henri verneuil the plot is an exact parallel of the jfk assassination and takes place in a non descript fictional country the film visually as well as plot wise is razor sharp shot with meticulous precision it follows henry volnay the procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup in many ways it's a very disturbing movie not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so called modern state's inner workings the atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable and verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting on another level this relatively little known movie just had a 15 years head start on oliver stone who was acclaimed for the jfk movie a inferior film in many areas the least of which not being credibility br br it's a masterpiece any cinema lover should see it preferably in its original french version with subs
<START> who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists what's intended to be a light frothy comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self indulgence as children the pair are unbearably precocious as adults they're intolerably immature it's a bad combination
<START> i heard about this movie when watching vh1's 100 most metal moments on the segment gene simmons who played a cameo and several other interviewees discussed how utterly awful this movie is unlike most people i'm often more curious about checking out movies that have reputations for being ridiculously bad than say a masterpiece of cinema the advantage of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out that the movies are nowhere near as bad as people said and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected that was my experience with trick or treat now it's hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people scoffing at the premise sure it's certainly a strange premise but one that's never been done before give the filmmakers points for originality for pete's sake if you're looking to buy the dvd having no prior knowledge of the movie don't be fooled into thinking ozzy osbourne and gene simmons are the stars however though simmons has a thankless role ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend that's right a reverend who speaks out against heavy metal for one thing it's funny seeing ozzy with short hair and for another thing you can't help but laugh at the irony sure it's a cheap shot but an effective one the acting is pretty good i found the performances convincing the teen characters are horribly clichÃ©d so expect the usual array of jocks and nerds and like in every one of these movies the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend why's she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place because the plot needs an obstacle no other reason but i can't deny that one of my guilty pleasures is watching the evil jocks in these movies go down since i was an outcast in high school the movie kept my interest for the most part but the third act is way too conventional and caused me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth viewing on a rainy day 7 out of 10
<START> this adaptation of m r james's short story 'a view from a hill' was first shown on british television in 2005 on the little watched digital channel bbc 4 i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc 4 and decided to give it a go remembering the bbc's successful 1970's adaptations of other m r james stories including 'whistle and i'll come to you my lad' and 'the signalman' though not in the same class as these masterpieces 'a view from a hill' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama br br a historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts whilst out in the countryside he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years but what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named gallows hill and what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation whilst not scary in any way i enjoyed this little production and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation as it is it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome br br i give it 7 out of 10
<START> i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles e g good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although well acted is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on ice br br every good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i don't need a feel good hollywood cheese fest but i've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares
<START> this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today the story is about a vietnam vet kris kristofferson being recruited by his brother jan michael vincent to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of it's great seeing kris play against type bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars jan michael shows real movie star persona in this film i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv it's a great flick for guys who like movies
<START> watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release i am surprised at how well it has held up one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film's perceived failure they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes oh and i haven't even mentioned the highly explosive ending
<START> in paris the shy and insecure bureaucrat trelkovsky roman polanski rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant the egyptologist simone choule dominique poulange committed suicide the unfriendly concierge shelley winters and the tough landlord mr zy melvyn douglas establish stringent rules of behavior and trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors meanwhile he visits simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella isabelle adjani after the death of simone trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide br br the weird le locataire is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable the performances are awesome and isabelle adjani is extremely beautiful my vote is eight br br title brazil o inquilino the tenant
<START> patrick channing jeff kober is a disciple of satan serial killer who possesses the first power even after being captured by detective russell logan lou diamond phillips and executed in the gas chamber he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton tracy griffith melanie g 's half sister he attempts to stop channing br br this concept probably had some possibilities i think but ultimately the first power suffers from routine scripting and film making this is nothing we haven't seen before sometimes done better there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers more to the point it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary phillips is a hard sell as a tough as nails cynical cop stereotype and griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober doing his best to be supremely creepy br br the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak br br not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind therefore br br 4 10
<START> the bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion these characteristics of idealistic imagery which moonstruck possesses spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in hollywood let me describe the circumstances to this film simply put they are yesteryear moonstruck is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old italian neighborhood in new york city new york city has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker some mannerisms which are indicative of typical new yorkers this includes a lot of italian americans living in new york as well the mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in american history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made these generalizing proclivities still exist today however they are more mollified and less identifiable for this italian family of a bygone era confusion indecisiveness agitation and yes of course love all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them the kindred spirits with everyone in moonstruck seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties one might wonder about cher playing the lead role as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie in moonstruck however i think she was incredibly well suited to her role and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation all of the characters in moonstruck are very rough around the edges really tough and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity the most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose i thought the acting in this movie was sensational all relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like for this family nothing is glamorous nothing is pretentiously romantic and nothing is overly emotional just moderately so the fact is this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve masqueraded mystique and resistance to the proverbial am ore' thus signifying everything the homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of be honest get angry be honest get confrontational be honest get distorted and emphatic most importantly be honest and fall in love this is cher's best performance ever as an actress nicholas cage danny aiello and olympia dukakis were wonderfully flawed in moonstruck such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie director norman jewison famous for cincinnati kid thomas crowne affair and most famous for in the heat of the night which won the academy award for best picture in 1967 depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film i am italian american in descent partially anyways cher is not italian and for that matter neither is the writer nor the director i guess since non italians like eating our food they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too it is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending for those of you who didn't like this movie i just have one thing to say snap out of it this movie moonstruck is totally happy go lucky totally eighties and totally five stars see it
<START> gojoe takes a little getting used to at first but the final result is very satisfying the tale about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch there is a lot at stake here from physical survival to soulful salvation the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime inspired samurai film at first but it does eventually delve into more mature adult territory soon after br br not to be missed gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around post kurosawa br br 8 out of 10 br br go to www nixflix com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return three what not three wishes but three rides into the 1800's on a rickety elevator br br the first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time
<START> i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone we can only hope while this remake wasn't a total waste i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original lots of violence and one of the worst endings i've ever seen this version doesn't add anything new it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone
<START> i know no one cares but i do this film is historic for one reason it is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci fi films well one is great and one is quite bad the great one is truly great in fact it's the best the bad one is truly bad in fact it's the worst of course of the great i refer to star wars and it's star mark hamill aka luke skywalker who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his vette swiped and then goes to vegas on a lead and after a whole lot of adventures eventually recovers it since he's into fixing cars i guess you can call him lube skywalker along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold and ends up facing off with a character played by kim milford the hero from the seventies sci fi cult film laserblast which is as i've hinted at earlier the worst sci fi film ever made milford plays the lead baddie whom hamill must steal his car back from i realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci fi heroes but i do and i also must say that this is one of the best worst movies of all time mark hamill's acting needs the force the plot needs extensive jedi training and the character of the hooker played by annie potts just might be the most annoying character of all time ever in any film i've ever seen but it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day or a weekday night late at night very late it's one of those films that meanders looking for something but without quite finding it and yet at the same time it's entire purpose is like free form jazz to simply exist as is and it does and what is isn't that great but you can't say it isn't entertaining because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off but you won't feel cheated so turn off your mind relax and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations and may the force be with you always
<START> this movie was horrible i could barely stay awake through it i would never see this movie again if i were payed to the so called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the 7 50 i payed to see it don't go see it don't rent it don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie horrible movie no need to ever see it
