<START> ok we all love the daisy dukes but what is up with this cast lets start jessica simpson as daisy there is not one thing country about this girl and daisy was not ditzy uncle jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original no offense to burt but i never noticed boss hog being so tall that was part of the humor of boss hog was his size did they even try someone like danny devito ok now get this they cast jessica simpson did anyone take a look at her husband he matches luke duke to a tee cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members the screen t's were never present on the dukes this made the movie a turn off from the beginning i give this a huge thumbs down
<START> one of the most unheralded great works of animation though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cut out method of animation a la south park the real talent behind twice upon a time are the vocal characterizations with lorenzo music's carlton from tv's rhoda woody allen ish ralph the all purpose animal being the centerpiece the accidental nightmare sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed
<START> this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but 'the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his free flowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by barry's frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film's final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms
<START> i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue but was pleased to find a fast paced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter finch amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematography there's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephants br br speaking of the stone buddha sequence you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk br br if you want a thought provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk
<START> i had planned to write something explaining what i didn't like about this movie but this is going to be more difficult than i thought honestly i can't remember much about it i watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me that's usually the sign of a real stinker about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look a like as the detective wore off real quick it would be different if he could act but he's a one note entertainer the kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them if you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie you need to see more euro horror the casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity
<START> i bought a dvd of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about the paranormal the movie was shot entirely on video so it has the look of a pbs special about it the special effects are phoney looking but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary statue br br however the acting is bad the plot scenes are long and very boring and i will tell you i have no clue what happened at the end if you get the movie rent it if you buy it please make sure you pay less than 5
<START> the freedom of having your own sea going power boat the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged an's man of an adventurer and lovely and so well endowed assistants in fine bikinis were all definite selling points for sea hunt 1958 61 br br just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going gun for hire series let's look closely now there must be a some clues around br br if we were to look back just a little we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater 1955 it starred jane russell gilbert roland richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean including a pre fidel cuba the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits fine shapely women folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits woo woo woo woo are always a plus for the guys and the presence of rugged athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake poses is equally pleasing to the gals br br and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes it is the recording of it's cherry pink and apple blossom white written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra br br anyone who hears this insturmental or song with lyrics will not soon forget it its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory the 45 rpm record of this song made it to the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv's your hit parade we can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got maybe some one can fill us in on that one item please so we got back to sea hunt and its own odyssey in getting on the tube the public had taken to underwater all right but would they go for a tv series br br ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that for the most part didn't get signed on by the networks for the multi station hook up treatment but they had been having some great successes with television syndication by that we mean offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area much like the various newspaper syndicates sell comic strips to various papers around the country and world even br br so we got 'mike nelson' himself in the physical presence of lloyd bridges mr bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies with chester morris to they stooge to conga 3 stooges 1943 sahara also 1943 home of the brave 1949 and the whistle at eaton falls 1951 br br lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization along with a fine convincingly athletic physique having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities he took very well as the diver's diver whether it's performing duties on board ship or fathoms beneath the sea br br and lloyd did take to the role quickly but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there he was not familiar with s c u b a prior to landing this mike nelson gig but the athletic mr bridges proved to be a quick learner as so many of the close up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it that it was lloyd with the mask the bubbler air tank and the flipper fins br br stories almost always involved the helping out some client for pay much like a private detective would so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit all the better br br like so many of the other ziv united artists tv productions sea hunt possessed a fine haunting opening theme and closing along with some original incidental music and queues br br at one time i believe that sea hunt was the top syndicated tv series a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of science fiction theatre and highway patrol as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga here in chicago it was shown late night after 10 30 p m on wnbq tv channel 5 our nbc affiliate now known as wmaq tv br br and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was and there were even on scene commercials done by the star how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson riding on his power boat and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch another adventure of sea hunt sponsored by the g heileman brewing company of lacrosse wisconsin' the makers of old style lager beer all while mike was toasting us raising an old style bottle shame on you mike drinking beer on your moving boat we're tellin' the coast guard then the boat would leave the dock accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits br br note more figuratively than literal mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story br br note ziv's syndicated successes included science fiction theatre west point and its clone men of annapolis sea hunt and highway patrol br br note and of course scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus
<START> i simply could not finish this movie i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award a scene in which pia zadora at a picnic stands between two boys who want her one the good boy pleads for her to see the error of her ways the other the bad boy simply asks if she'd like a hot dog which he then holds out for her at crotch level i hope i'm not spoiling anything to say she turns and takes the hot dog with a smile just pathetic
<START> my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up i'm not a fan of scooby doo so i'm not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters dodges tomatoes from fans of the others so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr phinius phibes i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course
<START> not the greatest film to remember paul naschy by br br gaston guillermo bredeston is probably the worst swordsman i have ever seen zorro would be ashamed his only salvation came as the competition was just as bad br br this film is described as adventure and horror forget the horror there is none no nudity no blood no monsters just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron paul naschy who wants to be king br br the main feature of the film was seeing graciela nilson who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss where did she go
<START> to be honest i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater big mistake because the 1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like it br br it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie this guy knows about action die hard 2 the long kiss good bye etc and it's particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him
<START> so this made for tv film scores only a 7 6 on this site bah humbug without question this 1984 version of dickens' classic tale is the best ever made and yes the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good but not good enough the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version although the acting was wonderful br br george c scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner then by three other spirits later on that evening scott is properly gruff as scrooge too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson but hey this is george c scott he's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy he has too much dignity and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner br br the supporting performances are uniformly excellent as are the costumes music and scenery 19th century london comes to life in clive donner's visionary style the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits the important tale of morality shines through in every frame though br br you won't often find this version aired on television anymore and that is a disappointment the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday when the decorations come out of the basement this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season br br 10 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> it's a pretty good cast but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original italian comedy big deal on madonna street anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original william macy may be one of our greatest living actors but here he's put to little use and his role in the original was played by marcello mastroianni so i sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes might as well try to imitate bogart or a young de niro the art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original sam rockwell has his odd and genial charm and luis guzman has that odd charisma but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat it's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals
<START> la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post 68 and eternal in many respects true the actors don't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by franÃ§oise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre lÃ©aud is one of the greatest french actors
<START> sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything great story great fights great characters and great cameos br br this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in br br some great and touching moments in the film lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off gutted br br the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button as its one of the best end fights i've seen sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow
<START> just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2 i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy 2 just as much if not more great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking the music is superb reprising the original's theme don't go expecting academy award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun that's what movies are designed for escapism i can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was am thinking about going to see it again this weekend go see it
<START> 1933 seemed to be a great year for satires duck soup for instance and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge the tone is like a humorous piece from the new yorker appropriate since the film begins with the goings on about town page of that magazine the only thing odd is the casting made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect however after 1934 you wouldn't have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion the young and beautiful loretta young in some shear and slinky outfits or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio even if you know nothing about bridge you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire
<START> cause they're both pretty lousy i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture rip someone to bloody pieces and calmly re enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened now you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention br br i admit i paid 30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie i know what you're thinking 30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole and you would be absolutely correct this movie sucks there it's right out in the open i was expecting some actual scares and i waited and waited and waited none came the raven probably a crow in makeup didn't scare me seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me and even faye didn't scare me i'm not that brave i know so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble what's more jennifer wasn't scared either her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about attaining more money honey you can't take money where you're going i need money she continually says completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function br br meanwhile i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother faye i was suspicious at first faye playing a grandmother and all and i was still suspicious at the end there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother from hell are forced to share temporarily and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother here's the weird part the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face lift from a renowned surgeon face lifts can't work miracles but i think faye's appearance is important to the rice paper plot spoiler it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting sorry my little joke seriously though there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate yuck huh interestingly enough mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact how did she avoid the family curse something's up with her obviously br br another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars this movie features one of my all time movie pet peeves i refer to the double ending this movie ends twice i absolutely hate it when that happens and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending didn't like it and forget to remove it during editing i guess it's supposed to be scary but it is only if you're a film editor br br there is one perk to this debacle though and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd the filmmaker commentary features faye dunaway and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to recite guess what the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again drat
<START> this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders the storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in texas us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by god to redeem the world of bad people br br bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew mcconaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son fenton meiks the film revolves around fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle played by powers boothe br br i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them even if you want to stop watching you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie br br the directors have filmed this movie very well and they help to set the plot through the good scenery the acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people br br whilst the concept of this film is very dark the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting this really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different br br 8 10
<START> based on a self serving novel by one time girl friend and groupie of f scott fitzgerald gossip columnist sheila graham wrote this trashy story gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be drunk or be damned alcoholic in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald focusing on fitzgerald's hollywood writing era late in his life the much honored author was in fact living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when aa was not yet well known fitzgerald was none too proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife in a mental hospital and his daughter in college living in a small apartment and driving a second hand chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie br br virtually every 20th century fox movie made during daryll f zanuck's leadership as well as virtually every film directed by henry king was a work of excellence beloved infidel was the exception
