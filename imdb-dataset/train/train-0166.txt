<START> we really enjoyed grey owl a simple tale well told in classic attenborough fashion a little over romanticized with archetypes humor and a stress of dignity and values br br beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of archie an englishman who turned native indian and went to live and trap in canada br br solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing br br two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings it must have been great to meet or read grey owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute
<START> it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the inter cutting between man and animal but here we have non diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalma's dressed to kill at the short lived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what i'm talking about i use pekinpah's credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off
<START> for anthony mann the western was 'legend' and 'legend' makes the very best cinema mann's work was full of intensities and passions visually dramatic and the action always excitingly photographed br br stewart a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger neurosis and cruelty made with anthony mann five remarkable westerns winchester '73 bend of the river the naked spur the far country and the man from laramie br br in winchester '73 stewart reveals his darker side he offers all the reserves of anger inner ambivalence and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had up till this time failed to catch br br a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style shelley winters is at her saucy best dan duryea perfect as the vicious sneering psychopathic villain john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor and a very young rock hudson attempts the role of an indian chief br br winchester '73 is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876 stewart and his estranged brother who bears another name stephen mcnally compete fiercely for possession of it and though stewart wins mcnally steals it and sets off cross country with stewart in pursuit what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic is stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brotherÂa revenge fed by long standing fratricidal hatred br br photographed in gorgeous black white the film comes on as powerful and arresting acted with deep feeling and intense concentration not only by stewart but by all the supporting characters br br look fast for a promising newcomer tony curtis the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack
<START> this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15 year old darius weems darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy a still un curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the united states him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on mtv's pimp my ride one of his favorite shows the journey begins in georgia where darius grew up and has never left the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ride in a hot air balloon swim in the ocean and visit sights he's always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material they make no money from sales of the 20 dvds 17 goes toward researching the disease and 3 goes toward making more copies the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety certain to stir hearts
<START> i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 years br br some time back i watched 6 fu films in a row boris karloff and all 5 chris lees the last 2 lees both directed and i use that word loosely by jess franco were abominable at the time i skipped this one remembering that in some ways it was even worse br br well i watched it never again you know what's worse that an abominable film a really well made piece of s and that's what fiendish plot is it is a very good looking movie great production design sets costumes music photography editing mostly good cast some decent acting br br and absolutely positively one of the worst scripts in movie history aaaugh the first minute of the film is so deceptive one might mistake this for a decent movie and then they start singing happy birthday to fu and it goes downhill having burt kwouk of whom his master says your face is familiar accidentally pour out fu's elixir vitae to put out a fire resulting in his being condemned to torture burial and having one of his ears cut off was the closest thing to funny they had it was like someone decided they wanted to do a campy film so ridiculous it would be funny ridiculous it is funny it ain't at all br br it's sad because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it right with a different script either a really funny one or a dead serious one they might have could have should have had a classic on their hands a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces by comparison br br there was a period in the late 70's when a whole slew of classic 30's characters were revived in movies that were universally awful buck rogers flash gordon tarzan the lone ranger charlie chan even doc savage i'm not sure this one may be the worst of the lot it took great self control not to fast forward over whole sections of it especially any scenes containing sid caesar fbi chief who was also al capone's cousin you see what i mean it isn't just that the ideas in the film aren't funny they often make no sense whatsoever like when they audition police officers to impersonate the king and queen and we wind up seeing people audition dance hall routines like singing dancing and riding a unicycle how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them br br as i said a shame and a real waste of all that talent including that of peter sellers who played both fu and nayland smith burt kwouk who'd been in a chris lee fu film in his time helen mirren the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half hour of the film i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a proper fu manchu film or if fans will have to settle for karloff's being almost the only one
<START> der todesking jorg buttgereit's second full length feature film the first one was notorious nekromantik has no central character or characters but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide divided into days of the week it comprises of a series of set pieces each of which featuring the self destruction of a complete stranger yes the production values are low and it's disturbing but in many ways der todesking is extremely effective it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment unlike the other buttgereit's works it isn't very gory but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide the last sunday episode is so depressing and full of pain just amazing if you want my opinion 10 out of 10 check out this post modernism shocker disturbing art in the purest form
<START> considering its popularity i found this movie a huge disappointment maybe i was expecting too much from this film after all it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s but i could never figure out why the story is uninteresting it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for since the intended hero is an idiot director chang has no sense of style and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative i know this is not supposed to be high art but i found the movie boring definitely not the best example of this much beloved genre its cult status escapes me i recommend you to skip it
<START> i usually enjoy films like this it's shot documentary style but the acting and writing are just awful the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so clichÃ© but not at all in a good way as of typing this i'm surprised it's at a 5 2 10 on imdb i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie i suppose if that's the case you might manage a couple of laughs as it's always funny seeing your relatives friends make a movie well in a way i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers directors actors etc 'cause if they can do it you can do it although maybe you shouldn't
<START> jason lee's pecks are back if that's what you are looking for look no further if not better move on br br but about the movie clichÃ©s galore some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes used jkd and lots of bad acting cheap effects poor lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie and no wonder not a pleasant comeback br br the movie doesn't even cut it as a b movie sure there was a germanish bleached blonde rutger wannabe bad guy but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots none zip nada even in starship troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence please refer to our upcoming review on that mind blowing sequel i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this thus i won't get into the plot of the movie or pretty much anything else related except that it did have some non heterosexual overtones so 'nuff said br br however this movie has one thing going for it no jean claude
<START> raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real unfortunately there is no reality to this film the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake br br the reason bad directing peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal it seems mr sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel wrong it just gives it a badly made feel similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on screen instead of enhance it br br of course what's on screen is so painfully fake as if mr sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he is br br overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr sollett is next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes
<START> i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny so i went into it with that expectation i just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise it could sustain a 3 4 minute comedy sketch maybe but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination
<START> with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons i couldn't quite believe how awful it was i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time but this was really hard going br br as others have noted a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be a gentle romantic comedy a slapstick comedy or a musical i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in it's not believable on any level either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter a songwriter for god's sake the fact he has diana dors for a fiancÃ©e and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her i mean diana dors come on and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office the whole thing's silly in the worst possible way br br if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson after that everything went downhill in a big way
<START> jeffrey combs is an insane scientist whose stem cell research has morphed into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark humanoid life form hoping to breed a brand new species using hunter tylo's womb it won't be easy for tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend william forsythe isn't about to give her up without a fight br br you see tylo and forsythe are two of business executive arthur roberts' employees brilliant minds who meet combs a scientist who once worked for roberts and whose vacated position went to tylo at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments this island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and son they think it's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases combs' son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him creating this blood thirsty flesh eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land although at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods tylo was dating combs' son hence the connection besides the two having worked for roberts who brings along his trophy wife mariya ignatova also accompanying tylo and forsythe roberts and ignatova are their colleagues elise muller and gr johnson combs traps them in a conference room but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son br br like similar sci fi channel creature features of it's type hammerhead shark frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks where the shark rips apart limbs are shot in a quick edit frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage you have this vague notion that a person is being eaten ripped to shreds but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which truth be told is rather infuriating the monster itself is never seen in it's entirety just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror one thing's for certain you do see teeth we do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen all menacing ready to feast on flesh a constant is while and after victims are attacked we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water's surface this is really director michael oblowitz's main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners br br combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold blooded resolve it's fun seeing forsythe in a rare clean cut hero role very against type as an electronics wiz to his credit he actually pulls it off who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril tylo is also in a very different kind of role a scientist who can defend herself quite well roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at combs' soldiers although his fate is not pleasant mentioning that it was also really entertaining watching forythe and tylo downing combs' hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns as expected the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins i mean seriously would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop
<START> once in a while a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come a chinese ghost story' falls in this category it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's possibly one of the best ever made br br the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan the story is engrossing and original the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening the sets are creepy and atmospheric there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house but don't let the horror' label scare you off if you're not a fan of the genre this film easily fits into many different categories br br the screenwriter has deftly blended the drama comedy horror kung fu and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza a chinese ghost story' is a beautiful epic love story told thankfully without the gratuitous nudity and or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood love stories' those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast paced swordplay and wire fu' if that's not enough actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy this film offers something for every film fan br br director siu tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian i cannot possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed ling choi sin better except maybe chow yun fat joey wang is enchanting as lit su seen the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of cheung's character her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable wu ma is hilarious as the cantankerous taoist who aids the young lovers br br on technical level this film is very impressive even by today's standards the direction is superb i wish that today's hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like siu tung ching rather falling back on the usual mtv video or pepsi commercial directors' the cinematography is gorgeous you have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night the special effects make up is top notch in fact most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films br br since its release a chinese ghost story has spawned two worthy sequels a full length animated movie and countless imitations none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic however this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time 10 out 10 br br
<START> abhay deol's second film written by imtiaz ali maiden directorial effort by shivam nair soha probably has her first meaty role as megha a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the delhi marriage registrar's office for her boyfriend dheeraj shayan munshi to meet her she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by ankush abhay deol they spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her then the boyfriend returns aage pardey par dekhiye sound familiar this is yet another adaptation of dostoyevsky's white nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from le notti bianchi very tiny though ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead but this is an earthier and more realistic duh adaptation than the much hyped and overblown saawariya i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing saawariya like crazy a few months ago br br the delhi settings are wonderful there is the obligatory run through old delhi shots of jama masjid from a roof top connaught circus streets with rickshaws what how the colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour br br the more i see of abhay the more i like this young man in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman soha looks beautiful and when she smiles she fits the role but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress or maybe she will blossom late like the brother the music by himesh reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up btw the fact that i love abhay deol's cute dimples has nothing to do with my rating
<START> horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies i'm not very fond of them myself but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibus featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent br br this film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt whom horror fans will recognise as one of lee's co stars in the greatest british horror film of all time the wicker man br br the first segment of the film titled method for murder tells the story of a horror storywriter whose creation a strangler named dominic is brought to life by his own imagination this story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend he and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination this story certainly isn't very original but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise br br the second story titled waxworks stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four this tale follows the story of phillip grayson cushing a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in inside he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess quite what the woman's relationship with phillip entailed is never really explained but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details cushing is later joined by his friend neville rogers played by joss ackland and that's when the tale really starts to pick up the setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film chamber of horrors although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia brought about by the limited area of the museum peter cushing is always interesting to watch and seeing him avoid an axe wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan despite being my least favourite this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down br br the film continues with sweets for the sweet which is without doubt the best of the omnibus this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly overprotective father the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out it leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter but we don't know who or what it is christopher lee as usual portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end epitomised by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is in fact afraid of his daughter the ending to this section is superbly played out in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told and will stay with you long after the end credits roll br br the omnibus finishes with the cloak which is definitely the most comedic of the four this tale is about a hammy horror film star that unimpressed by his latest film's technical side goes out and buys himself a cloak naturally this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak unlike the other three tales this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film the ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film also look out for the little jibe regarding christopher lee in dracula a nice touch i think br br overall if you want a horror omnibus you really cant go wrong with the house that dripped blood the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed
<START> this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it's amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland acting br br someone commented before me that if you had imagination you'd love this show that is a horrible approach to a tv series a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own story br br in conclusion absolute human waste
<START> horror fans i'm speaking to the over 12's although if you're under 12 i apologise for what you might deem an insult in short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then i can heartily recommend avoiding these steamers made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date it's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980's not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the 80's because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento carpenter landis dante and barker actually clive wtf are you doing in there glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i'm sure he was asked to partake more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill advised tv remake of stanley kubrick's masterpiece 'the shining' br br perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets sadly maybe so br br normally i wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits of a production i'd just rate it accordingly however as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune i write this as more of a warning than a review don't waste your time and money if you disagree with me then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these 'masters' of horror were being assessed on these works alone they'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor's degree unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s t
<START> l'hypothÃ¨se du tableau volÃ© the hypothesis of the stolen painting 1979 begins in the courtyard of an old three story parisian apartment building inside we meet the collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure impressionist era painter tonnerre a narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with the collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us he's going to show us something br br as he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds the collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings and so on and so on every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different br br i watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about if i have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation an indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which the collector poses some sexless plastic figurines in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life size versions of the figures if we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plastic br br whether i've come to any definite conclusions about l'hypothÃ¨se du tableau volÃ© or not i can say definitely that outside of the early and contemporaneous works of peter greenaway like a walk through h i've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so dense and at heart so mischievous and fun
<START> what the f was this i just watched steven stop please this movie is insatiably bad and silly in a bizarre departure from action and adventure mr seagal is now fighting obviously wish they were vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength ok oh and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way wow even still in this movie however to quell seagals have to have the last punch and no one can kick my a ego he is somehow stronger than they are however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him come on i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer but these are super human strength people oh and get this seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is wolverine oh my go and worst than all of that yes there is a worse than that he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film it was pure madness although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven awful awful awful two thumbs down redemeption qualities well i guess so i will be fair in that aspect at least some of the special effects were ok and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses the women all were quite attractive imo still and i said still it does not make up for the blatant x men underworld insert your favorite zombie vampire movie here rip off the director writer producer all should be bansihed exile from the movie business i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood rayne and just about all other uwe boll pictures about this film that's my whole 1 00 on this film view if you dare
