<START> one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a br br script existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hours br br long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives br br why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tom br br wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can br br with the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given but br br characters come and go for no apparent reason continuity is br br non existent and the acting cinematography and direction are to br br put it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunate br br choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone br br actually attempt to actually watch this film
<START> something very strange happens when you talk about global warming science goes out the window and belief and consensus becomes the topic of discussion br br it's because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al gore's documentary br br instead of promoting intelligent discussion he kept the debate at the level of belief and consensus br br of course when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to stop global warming you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans maybe none of it maybe some of it or maybe it has over ceded the next ice age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet br br but the fact remains that we don't know br br so we're asked to believe in the consensus never mind that any scientist that strays from the consensus is ostracized never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus einstein didn't believe in the consensus neither did copernicus or galileo br br so why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions if global warming is so incontrovertible surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening br br what is going on here that's the movie i was hoping al gore would have made istead he chose to shore up his support with the true believers of the consensus br br sad really
<START> to bend it like beckham may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football soccer but to english sports fans it is equivalent to hit it like bonds or dunk it like jordan any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal much like star player david beckham does much like the young indian girl jess parminder nagra does in the film bend it like beckham jess loves to play pick up soccer games the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother however while playing one day a passing friend named jules keira knightley sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling all girls soccer team after satisfying the coach joe jonathan rhys meyers she makes the team something she knows her mother would not approve of the movie is not about disobeying parents but rather a girl doing what she wants to do even if that goes against culture not just the parents there is humor thrown throughout the movie especially when jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian the movie does resort to a bit of a clichÃ© moment as the big soccer game is the same day as jess' sister's wedding but it does not come off a cheesy but rather fun and light the soccer action looks good so sports fans will enjoy it and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience bend it like beckham is not just about soccer but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time something that proves to be rather difficult
<START> voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak br br sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you're not interested in the male form stay away br br burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days
<START> dirty sanchez is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys pritchard dainton joycey and pancho go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are 3 series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg there's an episode on their love lives jobs etc the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations the third follows their european tour it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode
<START> wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania's but i would personally put it in my top 5 if not the top 3 it has so many great things and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era which was wwe's best era in my opinion hbk has the heart of a lion and him putting over austin like he did on his way out was pure class on his part it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see and it has j r and the king at their announcing best br br matches br br 15 Â team battle royal loud pop for l o d's return i'm not a fan of battle royal's and this is yet another average one very predictable even when you 1st see it it's obvious l o d would win looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though definitely helps br br 2 5 br br wwf light heavyweight championship br br taka michinoku c vs aguila br br taka gets a surprising pop with his entrance fast high flying and very exciting if these two had more time they would have surely tore the roof off with their stuff taka wins with the michinoku driver br br 3 1 2 5 br br wwf european championship br br triple h c vs owen hart stipulation here is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter nice pop for owen mixed reaction for trips a really really underrated match that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania actually the two mixed together very well and owen can go with anybody trips wins with chyna interference br br 4 5 br br mixed tag match marc mero sable vs goldust luna defining pop for sable unheard of that time for woman sable actually looks hot and the crowd is just eating her up constant sable chants and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring not bad for a mixed tag match it had entertaining antics and passed the time well sable's team wins when sable hits the tko br br 2 1 2 5 br br wwf intercontinental championship ken shamrock vs the rock c before i review the match i'd like to note the rock showed off his immense potential with his interview with jennifer flowers before his match nice pop for shamrock big time heat for the rock too disappointingly short and i thought the ending was kinda stupid though shamrock's snapping antics were awesome to see and the crowd went nuts for it rock keeps the title when the ref reverses the decision br br 2 5 br br dumpster match for the wwf tag team championship br br catcus jack terry funk vs the new age outlaws the outlaws are not as over as they were gonna be at this time crowd is actually somewhat dead for this but i thought it had some great hardcore bits with some sick looking bumps cactus and terry win the titles in the end br br 3 5 br br the undertaker vs kane big time ovation for the undertaker much better than there outing at wrestlemania 20 and for a big man vs big man match this was really good it was a great all out brawl with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump through the table wwe was smart by making kane looking strong even through defeat after 2 tombstone kick out's taker finally puts him away with a 3rd one br br 3 1 2 5 br br wwf championship br br special guest enforcer mike tyson br br hbk c vs steve austin big heat for tyson crowd goes ape sh t for austin definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard mixed reaction for hbk this is truly a special match up one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history you can tell when j r is even out of breath hbk gives it his all in what was supposed to be his last match and austin has rarely been better the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing and it's as exciting as it gets austin wins with the stunner with tyson joining 3 16 by knocking out michaels austin's celebratory victory is a wonder to behold with one of the nosiest crowd's you will ever see king said it right they were going nuts br br 5 5 br br bottom line wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real it has everything you want in a wrestlemania and truly kick started the attitude era this is very special to me because it was the 1st wrestlemania i ever saw back in 98 the austin era has begun br br 9 1 2 10
<START> i have seen this movie and the other one trinity is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one i have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them i have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie i like terence hill movies and i like bud spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies but you make mistakes so i would say save your money and don't bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one
<START> this is one of the best of the series ranking up there with resident evil 3 nemesis or biohazard last escape the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire redfield in the search for her brother chris redfield whom you probably know from the original resident evil it is as scary as the other resident evil and contains alot more cutscenes br br my rating out of stars rating based on comparison to other videogames
<START> verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch br br heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored br br this anime isn't perfect but it's at least mostly accurate as best i can tell
<START> if you are under the age of 6 or 7 then you're going to really enjoy this movie my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it as an adult i can't stand it i'm all up for sequels when they have a decent storyline but this is nowhere near up to standard please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much you'll understand why my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her br br i've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained
<START> as i have matured my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement as in a few other comments that i have written the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain the omission of in cold blood in 1967 as one of the five best picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable dr dolittle while only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that rex harrison disaster richard brook's powerful adaptation of truman capotes non fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen the film is definitely adult material based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place in cold blood was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio together with quincy jones's unsettling score hall's work should have been credited above the title with brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built the performances are fine as well scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense introversion as the two killers there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and the treasure of the sierra madre while the duo are driving to mexico as a child star blake sold the lottery ticket to bogart in that john huston film the film like the book is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti capital punishment tilt although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult to watch final scenes some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals their backgrounds and lives while the clutter family which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night come across as one dimensional characters of little import this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row the clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth however whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment in cold blood will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts run a double bill with dead man walking and you may not speak for days
<START> pinjar is a genuinely good film with great acting good narrative good presentation touching emotions etc br br it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days and this film is one evidence br br no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me i was literally thinking about the movie for hours marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human br br the film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar and also some from manoj bajpai urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face br br a must see film a technically superior bollywood product which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world
<START> kim patricia clarkson george jake weber and son miles erik per sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan's bustling metropolis on the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along rather than helping at least one of the hunters otis john speredakos is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers george kim and miles are disturbed by otis and even worse we quickly learn that otis has learned where they're staying meanwhile miles is given a wendigo a kind of indian shape shifting spirit monster token by an indian whom only he has seen is otis a psycho out to get our heroes are there wendigos in the woods br br i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers it is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature and perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered if you are discouraged by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo br br personally i like films like that i usually prefer some ambiguity the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 the monster returns but that's not what this film is wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people heck writer director larry fessenden even has a character george reciting robert frost the frost poem and george's comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things is the key to the film br br one of the best things about the film is its complexity in a way there are four different films occurring at the same time a thread from each character in george's thread he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world and he has some parenting problems for him the film is a realistic horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse in patricia's thread she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family she's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her hoping that they'll go away and get better in otis' thread he's even more down on his luck than george and george's arrival into his life symbolizes the final crack in his psychological armor and in miles' thread which is probably the most important of the film life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world but this is a horror story after all albeit one with a glimmer of hope and the events in the film give miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn still when everything is said and done he seems to be the only one retaining his composure due to the poetic outlook br br even though the film is low budget there are a lot of well executed higher budget ambitions fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations and created some interesting slide show like montages such as the cards or the indian wendigo images from the book there are also interesting more traditional montages such as miles' nightmare wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films br br other technical aspects are good for the budget the wendigo appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous the lighting was usually good there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock it could have been digital instead or transfer i thought the performances were good and far more realistic if you value that than the majority of films although i didn't really notice the score it must have been okay or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment br br overall wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch
<START> what's not to like about this movie every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it it was a win win situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only if br br drew latham ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie
<START> time has not been kind to this movie once controversial adaptation of jeffrey konvitz' best seller now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest gruesome touches aside particularly that crazy over the top finale this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre it has an extraordinary cast in small roles jose ferrer ava gardner eli wallach burgess meredith christopher walken and many others but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow movie producers of '70s disaster movies had a similar idea i kind liked to see the familiar faces but the story is very silly and no matter how high class the film pretends to be it operates at the level of your average '70s exploitation movie not an entirely bad thing though still it is an enjoyable movie especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing as usual albert whitlock's matte work is outstanding overall pretty entertaining
<START> i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg that's about the length i've come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of it br br by contrast ang lee's film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasn't a compliment it's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all br br the film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to re read that sentence to make sure i hadn't written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies i'm afraid lee lost me right there it's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we aren't properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear he's a gormless pimple of a man who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go home br br aggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent i've heard accents from all over the english speaking world and this is the worst of them all i don't care if southerners really did talk like that it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lee's picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical say everything three times folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate br br in short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who don't bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
<START> legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children with an a list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman an oscar worthy performance here ethan hawke marisa tomei and albert finney lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs but also family stories such as ordinary people br br many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here instead of showing it in a linear manner he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei as well as between father and son finney and hoffman all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment
<START> the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too short career in 1981's arthur a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles big belly laughs and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach a drunken playboy who races cars plays tennis fondles women but he has weekends off and he's his own boss arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston jill eikenberry who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla liza minnelli a waitress struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur's acid tongued butler and best friend hobson whose outward disdain for arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda's father stephen elliott as susan's father and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur's demented grandmother the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon who sadly died the following the year there was also a forgettable sequel several years later but this instant classic is not to be missed
<START> lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages in a way that just makes you feel good a bug's life has that same charm it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects because even though they talk they still act just like real bugs it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them to imagine bugs the way a young mind does br br honey i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger and to me a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's but then again almost nothing is the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun br br the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society mostly geared around building a harvest of food most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers vastly superior in strength and general meanness and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food the consequences will be dire and incidentally the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forwardÂ br br the fun and excitement begins when flik the main character sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers you see he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger so he feels it's his responsibility but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers great for the audience not so great for the safety of the clan br br the movie was released back in the late 90s when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos like armageddon and deep impact independence day and the arrival a bug's life and antz etc comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role this is great family fun
<START> it has been 16 years since it's original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to re release the original 65 episodes i can't fathom why the sci fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scripts the animation was above average quality for it's time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it predated the heavy toon toy tie in market this may have sealed it's doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available
