<START> in the wake of lock stock and two smoking barrels the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then in one of the all time great cases of pearls from swine the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'the best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because at the time of writing it was the only film that had been released in 2000 looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia's lads mags brigade Â rhys ifans sadie frost nick moran and joseph fiennes Â but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no one really knows what it is or perhaps simply don't think it matters something to do with ifans' businessman being set up with steven berkoff's homicidal russian crime lord in a money laundering or investment scheme it's never clear which because no one ever asks by fiennes' crooked irish accountant who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald's ludicrously accented russian temptress berkoff keeps on saying bizniss and francis drake and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts br br when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr you know a film is in deep trouble with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own sitting there like a joke shop dog turd
<START> basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child at the adoption agency they meet a mouse stuart and they decide to adopt him if you think that this is stupid hold it because it's getting worse br br stuart arrives to his new home where he is treated like a human child spare me the rest is pretty much the usual clichÃ© about family problems jealousy from the elder brother and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a happy family boring and worn out as this is it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way br br i don't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clichÃ© or he was just trying to fill in minutes but he only upgraded the clichÃ© from boring to abhorrent br br then why i gave a 3 and not a zero because of the family cat who loves stuart as much as the brother and because of some funny gigs where stuart makes good use of his small size br br on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if a stuart was a pet and not a sibling b it had kept to the funny gigs like stuart trying to outwit the cat and had left out boring clichÃ©s which don't even match with anything else
<START> yokai monsters spook warfare yokai daisenso 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade br br the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living 'brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd like wrist so on br br these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to today's halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks ghosts goldfish monsters dancing one headed umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers the fatcheek woman such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls if their design for the movie is a bit simple hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills br br these rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan disguised himself as a samurai lord despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very poker faced is very charming it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touching br br yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf cub white heaven hell 1974 and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun the first miike movie which is the most child oriented of his family films with the gozu izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers
<START> ok i adore this film i will credit this movie alone for making me such a die hard horror fanatic i could never watch this movie alone i've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres on its viewers incredible masterpiece horrible psychological stuff scares the pants off me oh bless their hearts whoever made this awesome film i love it i thought the whole film was decent and interesting this movie is so scary this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough but what always got me was brendan's fabulous acting best horror film ever nothing can ever be this scary again halloween viewing at its evilest
<START> a quite good film version of the novel though at the beginning a little bit lengthy fortunately there are a few funny scenes from time to time this movie is surely not for the main stream audience but for fans of italian or portuguese cinema a must see also for mastroianni fans
<START> is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of 3 iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film br br oh sure kim's nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes it's kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd's special features but i'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation br br what is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kim's satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand br br the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more
<START> batman mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video dvd movie to be released minor spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a new crimefighter the batwoman who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major arms shipment br br although the movie is interesting enough it's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm ' 'sub zero ' or 'return of the joker ' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did at the end of this movie we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others especially 'sub zero ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character as mr freeze or phantasm were not only that but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal br br don't get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable it does have its moments such as when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman the animated series ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments br br if the batwoman's background was more interesting this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book but as it is now it's in 4th out of 4 br br as for the animation it's the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films but it's still good nonetheless br br i do recommend buying this dvd because despite its flaws it is enjoyable but just remember it's not as good as the other batman animated movies br br 7 10
<START> not as bad a film as i thought it would be br br it has a good cast nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors br br would like to see more of olivia d abo in future projects maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d abo br br also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg br br hopefully we will see more uk european co productions like this

<START> military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves among the more prominent we have officer and a gentleman' top gun' gi jane' and now men of honor' the fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same this film is probably most like gi jane' since it focuses on the desegregation angle br br the story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human interest story among those mentioned above carl brashear cuba gooding jr is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film unfortunately director george tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than brashear in favor of showing brashear in a constant state of adversity billy sunday robert de niro is a central figure and except for the initial scene the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife we don't know much about him for instance brashear sees the scars on sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow but there is no follow up on that point mr pappy hal holbrook gets only one short scene by which we can judge him the rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting if a director is going to make a human interest story he needs to humanize the characters br br cuba gooding jr gives an outstanding performance as brashear this is probably the best i've seen him this is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before and he rises to the occasion in jerry maguire' rod tidwell was a fascinating but one dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle brashear is much more complex and grounded and the issues he faces are life crises making the part far more challenging this is an excellent recovery from gooding's last role in chill factor' a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part br br after a stint trying his hand as a comedian analyze this' the adventures of rocky bullwinkle' meet the parents' robert deniro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance deniro isn't a bad comedian he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy deniro endows billy sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul it is a pleasure watching him work br br it seems every film i watch lately has charlize theron in it i saw the legend of bagger vance' men of honor' and the yards' right in a row and i was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 actually she only did five this was a minor role for theron but she carried it off well and managed to stay with deniro step for step david keith who co starred with richard gere in officer and a gentleman' has a cameo here br br the dvd has some interesting special features including reflections by the real carl brashear and some deleted scenes br br i enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one dimensional presentation i rated it a 7 10 i'm a sucker for underdog stories and i have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme this film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings
<START> there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie they took a sleazy story miscast it miswrote it misfilmed it it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story br br as badly as it fails as art it fails even worse as commerce who could have been the target market for this what age group what interest group br br someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie that i would pay to see br br i've seen thousands of bad movies and this ranks with sailor who fell from grace and manos my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies i've ever seen everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all eternity br br i challenge you watch this movie and perform an academic exercise how could you take this and make it worse i can't think of one way
<START> jeremy brett is simply the best holmes ever narrowly edging out the great basil rathbone of course and this is probably the best adaptation of a conon doyle short story br br a length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for milverton br br excellent performances all round especially from robert hardy and both brett and hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama
<START> have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before that happened to me with the young graduates the cover of the video box if you can find the video is extremely deceiving i'd swear that the two women on the cover aren't even in the film br br anyway i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or it is simply pointless junk i'm heavily leaning toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie br br hmm plot a plot let's see there must be a plot around here somewhere nope i can't find it it's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago one of the female students has a crush on her teacher the teacher has a frigid wife whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg so he is receptive to the girl's advances br br there's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing our cat booboo was transfixed by the dancing high school kids she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor it's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic 1 10
<START> man this is a hard dvd to come by i could only find it on region 2 a spanish import and it was expensive br br was it worth it well yes not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making though directed by curt siodmak the credits on imdb com read robert but the dvd credits list curt or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries elisha cook jr and thomas gomez but because my decade long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied br br essentially a respected but self contained engineer alan curtis has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a new york bar with two show tickets in his pocket a woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review she accepts a little gloomily the mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave br br at the show the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger the drummer in the band cook leers at the silent lady but gets no response curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it and she doesn't want to know his if she'd been a longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night br br okay curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence the head police officer gomez turns him over to the da his only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember not the bartender not the latina star not the cab driver al alp not the drummer and since the lady herself has disappeared it's impossible to dig her up br br curtis is convicted and sentenced to die but inspector gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story he joins curtis's loving secretary ella raines in re investigating the case informally br br they visit the supposed witnesses again the ominous bartender is run over by a car perhaps accidentally so he's out of the picture the hot tempered latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway elisha cook jr is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group his sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous orgasmic insanity his eyeballs roll to the ceiling his mouth gapes his hammering becomes frenzied i laughed out loud br br nobody's performance is otherwise outstanding but all are professional enough thomas gomez is always reliable best performance though is probably by franchot tone he's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi he's reserved and artistic even when he faints he's decorous i don't know how to put this precisely but tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part alan curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the kelvin scale and belongs in a b picture br br i don't know why it's considered as classic it's really your basic murder mystery by cornell woolrich not as good as some of his others but siodmak's direction is sensitive a man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it his use of shadows is quietly effective br br glad i got it
<START> there can be no denying that hak se wui election in english is a well made and well thought out film the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition Â a theme played with throughout the film where john woo's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled 1992 and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad' point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being city on fire 1987 br br election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful if that's the right word manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces' of film making it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in Â not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say goes the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular br br election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other triads are having a pre election talk but the police show up and guess what you know br br once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been hotwired another chase involving a motorbike and a kung fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street Â the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like i said they are in a 'tasteful' manner where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail when the triads are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in cages as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol elevating themselves above other head gangsters who'd use champagne the long good friday and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate br br election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise en scene as you look at what's going on some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at chinese tradition in the process i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner of course
<START> footlight parade is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros produced in the early 1930's to ward off the depression 42nd street and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era and they made literally millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while and enjoy themselves br br while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell ruby keeler and dick powell only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney almost ten years prior to his most well known musical yankee doodle dandy here he dances in that most original of dance styles with his arms usually lowered at his side and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks it's easy to see that he is enjoying himself and that makes us enjoy him all the more br br while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film they are well worth the wait i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risquÃ© but it's all in fun br br it doesn't matter what the plot of the film is just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast besides those already mentioned guy kibbee is at his flustered best here br br 7 out of 10
<START> i'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film after watching it however i honestly believe that i could have made a better documentary myself its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources despite his being listed in the credits on imdb i didn't see richard dawkins anywhere it's edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects and it doesn't make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial the narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering almost adolescent anti christian sentiment ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir i e me though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of jesus the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the christian school which the director attended as a child an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day br br though tgwwt obviously had a low budget there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of christianity there's certainly a dearth of skeptically minded religious documentaries on the market and this film could have helped fill the void instead the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him it's too bad that his christian upbringing traumatized him but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism
<START> it's got christopher lee it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises it's got volcanoes evil aliens disguised as nuns tidal waves earthquakes exploding cars exploding coffee machines and as a climax the entire planet blows up how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly mind numbingly dull the answer my friend is because 90 of this movie is made up of establishing shots most of them involving long tracks pans or zooms in combinations or occasionally all three that do nothing except give the crew something to do there are endless shots of our protagonists driving getting in and out of cars driving again walking around looking at stuff getting in cars and driving i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering say something please somebody just say something do something anything br br the dialogue when it does come is terrible br br maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours was a typically meaningless line the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage justified in this speech from lee as the head alien br br the planet earth has emitted an over abundance of diseases they are contaminating the universe all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed br br this is is neanderthal sf script writing this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds it is and i collect such things the most god awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters br br lee who always struck me as a smart useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek i don't blame him
<START> cause it's crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera work count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible i'd bet 10 they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainment stare at a wall
<START> there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply defies description something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth which kills them or turns them into zombies the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet i'm not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle br br the film is total trash surreal bad trash spectacularly one of a kind bad trash there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there which aren't very hot or erotic there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula which had me rolling on the floor br br definitely one of the worst movies ever made up there with the equally wretched direct to home video boardinghouse or boogeyman ii both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on
