<START> bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little penquin which he tries to save from an eskimo this short tries and the penquin is adorable but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughs department the eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown antagonists so i can't in good conscience recommend this one however it is nice to see it in it's uncut form this cartoon is on disk 3 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 br br my grade c
<START> this was the worst movie i've ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad that's what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting br br so go watch this movie but don't buy it
<START> i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure br br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
<START> ridiculous looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves so far for the horror elements this movie has all the rest of munchies plays out like a really retarded comedy that's so stupid you won't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes i can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers but adults will be left with only those supposedly smart references translating to on screen stuff like capt kirk's log entries from star trek the most well known scene from e t a blatant statement from the filmmakers going look we're cashing in on gremlins' success here and a cardboard cut out of clint eastwood telling us what about his western movies exactly that last one was totally lost on me oh yes and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing don't know where they got that idea from br br not to say that munchies is the most insufferable film to sit through for that matter it's just really really dumb and if you manage to crack a smile while watching it you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished br br good badness yes but only if dumb retarded ridiculous are criteria you're looking for 3 10 and well uhm 6 10
<START> a pretty average scifi film the plot was more or less obvious from the start although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films br br the basic plot scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting onboard they find a stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship br br after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter which i didn't consider to be a good film either br br not a good film get aliens out and watch that again br br
<START> this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot aside from the lack of plot the acting was atrocious the special effects were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about it's now a running joke among my friends and i 1 out of 10
<START> in what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 i've had to endure in a long time al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure not his usual typecasting which was nice but his character was just truely pathetic someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy but in this movie we needed someone to like and for some reason every character in the picture said i don't know why i like you eli to al pacino's chracter and i couldn't even come close to liking him br br all the other actors played their usual styles tea leoni richard schiff and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films and kim basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind br br the movie's story had no momentum most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti climactic ending it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story br br whats the point of the film daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe once hollywood has you you can't get out yeah right and that's why so many people get fired in hollywood
<START> a blockbuster at the time of it's original release it was the second highest grossing film of 1976 the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike the film open to scathingly negative reviews however 5 6 million budgeted picture went on to gross over 150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden globes it's not without some irony that streisand's most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial for every ten fans who state that star is streisand's best film there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography although both sides have some merit to support their claims it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that hollywood ever produced for my money it's the best version of the often told tale br br the film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses it's classic predecessors for example the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never ending phone calls that interrupt kristofferson's songwriting attempts this version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters for example the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self sacrificing that they came off as saints on the other hand esther the female lead in this version is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate but also flawed and conflicted this makes her feel more real than the janet gaynor or judy garland characters felt in the previous films and makes the story that much more effective br br the performances are all on target even if some of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough if you're looking for an actress singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance streisand is definitely the girl you want she's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural and as usual she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer simply put her esther is a fully realized three dimensional human being kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid back characterization however he's always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from newsweek time and even the new yorker's usually vicious pauline kael gary busey and paul mazursky also give believable performances but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time br br the film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success hitting the 1 on billboard's hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone the streisand composed evergreen with lyrics from paul williams is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop brought to even further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from streisand the rest of the film's original songs mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes are pretty good as well and streisand sounds fantastic her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded streisand's vibrant performances bring woman in the moon and with one more look at you to thrilling life and make even sillier numbers like queen bee work far better than they have the right to kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless however that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline br br though naturally dated in some respects it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well the film is well mounted and slickly produced the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective in conclusion a star is born is not only entertaining and moving but it also transcends all criticism
<START> i bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over 1 500 dvd's with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin
<START> this is an excellent modern day film noir excellent in that it's interesting start to finish there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief but i haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story the movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters in addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack br br i labeled this crime movie a film noir because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good even the only supposed good guy played by nicholas cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have he also does something at the end which isn't right but i'm not going the spoil it by saying suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good br br speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than dennis hopper not many at least in the deranged category he's tough to beat lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons j t walsh gives another great supporting performance too br br this is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have you'll have fun watching this by the way try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up
<START> having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly i thought lion king 1 5 might be worth watching what a disappointment disney must be getting desperate for revenues br br especially now that they lost the deal with pixar br br basically they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor or garbage can and glued them together to make a br br quick buck unlike lk i ii both of which had strong story lines br br this movie hardly has a story at all while the characters and animation are always fun to look at there is simply not enough material here for a movie some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings br br disney shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck br br next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work
<START> this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from boogie nights thelma and louise showgirls frisk and even a curious dash of 400 blows thrown in towards the end at least the director did his research the result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything however the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind the scenes world of gay porn br br
<START> 102 dalmatians walt disney i wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first a silly padded storyline terrible over acting by glenn close who hams up every scene as though she's playing for her own amusement and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors once more the dogs are the only actors that seem real and thats a stretch another wasted effort here grade d
<START> it's official folks hou hsiao hsien doesn't have a thought in his pretty little head are you wondering why he chose shu qi as his muse br br shu or is that qi doesn't appear in this one instead we get a snaggletoothed yo hitoto apparently a pop star in japan judging by her song at the end she's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at rockin' curry is a actriss and a wasted tadanobu asano typically an indicator of quality who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling asian hipster and is too old to manage even that br br hou's philosophy life is limbo a big nothing feel it and move on i'd like to do that but hou gives us nothing to feel in cafe lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of life in tokyo circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night no make that trains that pass in the day never connecting each hurtling to its own destination usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they're lucky yikes flowers of shanghai is one of the most rarefied technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time how could the same director who created the opening shot of that film which features about twelve actors conversing at machine gun speed for about ten straight minutes an impossible directorial feat get trapped making this laconic sub jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now millennium mambo may be dead weight but at least it has two great shots shots that hint at hou's true calling as the film equivalent of odilon redon those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of shu qi floating down a blue corridor his m o while making cafe lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium mambo to make it more consistent you be the judge if that sounds appealing br br hou does not need to refine you cannot refine the limbo idea further than flowers of shanghai he needs to expand to bloat outwards to release the inner expressionist and genre revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichÃ©d minimalism it's time for him to do a live action remake of akira or something this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe ghettoized and stagnant as the hollywood action blockbuster what is the connection between reality and people who can't talk it seems to me that people in real life never stop jabbering then again considering that 2005 alone brought big budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as aeon flux the island and king kong it's now safe to say that even michael bay has surpassed hou and that's really sad br br the good news is that though hou is in his 50s it frankly feels to me as if he hasn't even begun there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset red while hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins but whatever fear is holding him back however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema hou your time as the darling of the rotterdam venice toronto berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double quick two words for you atom egoyan two more words or maybe three tsai ming liang you are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever risk your shirt on a sci fi epic sell out be reviled but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart let your painterly talent express itself to the full you're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise
<START> i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians with the exception of stewart and novak the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses machine guns or alien monsters and i planned on being bored but i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground as the glorious george duning love theme soared i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love the first stirrings of romantic sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater i am sure i'm not the only pre adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak's startling direct gaze it's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump start heterosexual puberty in so many of us i am in my late 50's now and re watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later
<START> review in english since swedish is not allowed br br i saw this movie with extremely low expectations and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them br br as much as i loved to see janne loffe karlsson on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water isn't original or funny the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that ain't is just plain boring i smiled like three times during the entire film br br the placement of swedish findus products is unintentionally funny why not just a big sign saying findus made it happen br br gÃ¶ta kanal 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd just wait for it to air on tv it wont take too long
<START> in my life i have seen many great and awful movies i am not an expert in professional reviews but i have definitely something to say about this one firstly these actors are the worst i have seen their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the dvd in the first 2 minutes i think that these actors were not interested in the quality br br another awful thing is about these dialogs they are so lame you sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them it seems that your 14 year old son could act better i feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old european car br br please if my message reaches you save your time and money
<START> flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre equal parts sleaze feministic journey and history as we follow flavia on her strange trip br br we start off with flavia in a convent she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male dominated rules and macho ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal abraham they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another non believing nun in hastening a moslem invasion flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get busy with the nuns in a strange set of scenes eventually the moslems roll out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene br br this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film some good gore including nipple removal and a nice leg skinning scene some decent nudity including the requisite full frontal and a decent storyline as well i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points but not enough to get truly bored with it i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit 70's exploit fans 8 10
<START> sundown the vampire in retreat is a rubbish the acting is terrible the atmosphere is non existent and the characters are uninteresting the only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the imdb users gave it a 10 this is really horrifying no gore no suspense no violence nothing bruce cambell the evil dead intruder is completely wasted the supporting cast is also terrible yes some people may like this picture especially a mainstream society but hard core horror fans or gore hounds won't enjoy this piece of crap personally i hate horror comedies i prefer watching serious horror movies like cannibal holocaust or last house on the left in my opinion a real horror movie is supposed to be scary excessively bloody and disturbing without stupid humour which usually ruins the whole concept this one isn't scary isn't gory isn't even funny as a comedy so don't waste your precious time
<START> a thief in the night is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low budget which was obvious and its subject matter the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind nevertheless it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ it touched everyone showing even a pastor who preached the word but did not believe it knowing exactly why he was left behind this movie and its sequel distant thunder are must see movies even with the new left behind series coming out telling the same story with a much higher budget the impact is still the same a thief in the night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered
