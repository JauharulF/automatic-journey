<START> a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap at least the music in spinal tap was good br br this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it's worst a bunch of hollywood execs bad musicians and producers create some poopie show so their kids can be in the spotlight oh please the potty humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids musicians actors and artists out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along br br help u all why wasn't gene simmons in it ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet
<START> i gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute really funny all while being unpretentious i went to see this film when it was playing in the philly area and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends the film is well written and well acted and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie that doesn't take away from the film you just don't find comedies like this anymore where you don't have to shock people to be funny the film centers around a ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help though at first she helps soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for things get further and further out of control until you'll have to see the banter had me laughing even after leaving the theater this film just put me in a good mood i can't wait until it is released on dvd because i want this movie in my collection
<START> generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cage's shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never settles into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self
<START> in 1979 i was a boy of 12 years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a 12 year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing vans the total ass wipe with the baddest van the water bed the smoking of herbs the hot 70's chicks the 'makin love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my skates with 4 wheels not in a strait line go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair truly great memories of young adolescence
<START> i'm not a regular viewer of springer's but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally i'm going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo farce about trailer trash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hot as hellll is a trailer trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusual looking chain smoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show that's right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an african american couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah blah freakin' blah trash has rarely been this borrringg i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now it's totally obvious whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain it's a total mess of a motion picture if that's what you call it it's so badly edited with scenes that just don't connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs br br my only positive note is a hot girl girl scene that's as risque as it gets don't get me wrong the scene's pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springer's program this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> in the mid 1930s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look how they should be structured and how they should be acted the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue br br this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents for one thing many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative and were overburdened with title cards but what the informer has is the self assuredness to extend moments between dialogues to focus on reactions more than speeches and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere br br director john ford for all his capability was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material if he thought a story was silly he just did it half arsed luckily the informer with its depiction of community honour working class life and most importantly irish setting was everything ford loved and the result is one of his finest works in it ford only really employs too kinds of shot the first is of places Â the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us the second is of faces striking close ups against plain backgrounds usually without dialogue focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people br br lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him mclaglen's performance does not look like much being as it is about 90 drunk act but the other 10 is heartfelt emoting as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity with such performances are oscars won mclaglen is backed by a spot on supporting cast among whom there are no weak links in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una o'connor usually only seen in comic relief roles playing straight dramatic parts for once although meek's appearance does contain one or two jokes the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy br br rko who produced the informer were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios thanks to this we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti hero at its centre which could easily have been a clunky over earnest mess instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world
<START> ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie this is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link acting is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli but something is really astonishing in this movie talking about sexuality emancipation of women nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema even in this days i really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies but with better quality the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting but also the lack of prfessionalism this movie look like an amateur one we can see a lot of errors in the screen if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended but if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same
<START> i saw this movie once late on a public tv station so i don't know if it's on video or not br br this is one of the baby burlesks sic that shirley temple did in the early 1930s it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of kiddie porn br br shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5 they are all in diapers and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol the cash is in the form of lollipops br br shirley playing a femme fatale sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her but shirley doesn't need really their lollipops cash because her purse is full of ones from other men br br meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table br br what a strange film infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon who thought up this stuff any way
<START> elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir br br yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femme fatales br br where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel belongs in a category with these classics br br from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixon's crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation br br sure he's that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah he's been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time br br yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didn't they had have it coming br br hoods dusters mugs gutter nickel rats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixon's right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands br br and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before br br right away he's in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner dixon's questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he is br br when he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor's existence into something worth coming home to br br the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy br br and all of this top notch direction and acting isn't too slick or buffed to loosen the film's emotional hold gene tierney's angelic soft focus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and andrews's dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self destruction br br near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says one false move and you're in over your head br br perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion br br one nit pick of an aside this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd br br but noir fans heck any movie fans who haven't seen this one are in for a terrific treat
<START> maslin beach is a real nudist naturist beach south of adelaide on the fleurieu peninsula in south australia it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location br br maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy this could be slightly misleading as it is not a 'hilarious' film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have light hearted moments much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the copious amount of flesh br br simon and marcie michael allen and eliza lovell arrive by car at a beach side car park they take their belongings to the beach and while they are walking a voice over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is the rest of the film is an exploration of this framed by one complete day at the beach the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes br br when they arrive at the beach both simon and marcie appear bored with each other marcie sees them as a 'romeo and juliet' romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to gail bonnie jaye lawrence paula zara collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them 'attractive' and young part of the realism of this film br br to service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent short sighted ice cream salesperson with a van this is ben gary waddell who is a friend of simon and is also his unofficial counsellor i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud unless you were intoxicated male and very young maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is variable the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive boon in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its bluntness and downright 'aussie' attitude to carnal matters br br the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach cliffs and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of gratuity in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space' and makes the film more tasteful not an easy task given the location for filming br br maslin beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post pubescent testosterone charged males nor a 'mills and boon' romance for under appreciated women maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not 'attractive' in the baywatch sense and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement other than perhaps to naturists apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema verite and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a rash option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that maslin beach is now a collector's item that the film might become internationally popular but it is very unlikely br br during this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about maslin beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the crest of the hyper real action drama angst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality maslin beach is not exactly 'jacques tati' either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism equality gender orientation and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am sure that you will either love or hate this film with little room for a middle ground br br
<START> this is the only movie i've seen prince in but it don't matter and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong this is probably his best performance the music is great thats why it won the oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie or something like that now he has an oscar and grammies under his belt although the cursing gets in the way with the film just make sure no little kids or in the room there isn't to much to say without revealing the plot you should really go out and get this movie your collection isn't complete unless you got this movie in it what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now
<START> the movie opens upon julian sands lying on his back a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it about two feet above him that was so provocative and i thought here we go a good vampire movie br br and then it died that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination it was slow uneventful drivel thereafter i was vastly disappointed as my previous experience with sands' acting was quite enjoyable however this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired br br even julian sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie br br it rates a 1 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i went into this movie expecting it to be really god awful and it was i really felt sorry for the star studded cast kathy bates was a wonderful actress before she made this movie vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for fred's dad played by trevor peacock of vicar of dibley fame amongst others had about one line br br the plot was predictable and all over the place and the humour was lacking however there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head on collision with a train actually maybe the train would be better
<START> i didn't know willem dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he'd disgrace himself with such shocking hamming in this monstrosity hell i'll donate that money that i was going to send to ethiopia if he's that desperate i have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time who paid for this they are either pulling some tax scam or insane a 5 year old would be ashamed of the plot and i'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour i suffered already everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison avoid at all costs i'd give it minus 10 if possible unbelievable
<START> i saw this hot movie when it came out in 1986 it had a x rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres it was an art film supposedly it's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene br br what i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy federico pitzalis in love understandably with an older woman maruschka detmers as has been mentioned before detmers is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave a very good performance pitzalis was to put it mildly pretty poor it's no wonder he never made another movie still despite the infamous sex scene which is explicit but pretty brief this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly the good acting by detmers only helped to a certain point mostly i was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end if it didn't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago dull and slow you can skip this one
<START> the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended i didn't know films could be made like that entirely original in it's visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be it's as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly integrating many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none predominant despite hollywood's dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning europa is what cinema should strive to be
<START> burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions he'd show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap br br no film epitomized this more than stroker ace which makes cannonball run look like a classic and cannonball run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing br br if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse
<START> judging from this film and the strong man made the same year i would not place harry langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians there simply is not enough there perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously in any event all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men but he lacks the acrobatic skills of keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of lloyd he also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like chaplin's tramp character his trademarks are childlike innocence timidity of approach and a tendency to under react to calamity by looking perplexed batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger the comedy in langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naÃ¯ve ways or with a minimum of physicality such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away propping up a collapsing building with a two by four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him in this story about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross country walking race to publicize a rival company's footwear he manages to win by sheer luck there is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the big three
<START> the plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes if you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89 its an interesting historical piece for us locals seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town i didn't know the director was from st cloud
<START> when i saw this movie circa 1979 it became the first movie that i ever walked out of in the middle there is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny and this misses every time although i can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie there was nothing original about any of the skits while i enjoy racy humor where appropriate these skits were needlessly vulgar what was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as robin william's first movie capitalizing on his new found fame in the mork and mindy television series yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on screen
