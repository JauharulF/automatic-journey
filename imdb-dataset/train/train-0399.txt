<START> is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television or the media in general as the 1960s no and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time not really but if we must have one does it have to be as shallow as the '60s br br i like to think that co writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its ilk it's seen from the point of view of one family but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade br br the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially clichÃ©d and then when they're back on blammo it's something else garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly in fairness jerry o'connell jordana brewster jeremy sisto julia stiles and charles s dutton give their material the old college try but they're wasted especially the latter two it's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton and rosanna arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome br br what isn't welcome is how the '60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post 60s america never mentions the british invasion no beatles no rolling stones then again there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album right capping its surface skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending american dreams and the wonder years did it all much much better nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere people except for julia stiles doing the twist that is
<START> eight academy nominations it's beyond belief i can only think it was a very bad year even by hollywood standards with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway but the oscar nominations really sold it to me and i feel distinctly cheated as a result br br so it's a black comedy is it can anyone tell me where the humour is in prizzi's honor it's certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a policeman's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about 'your favourite mexican cigars' which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last 50 years i failed to spot anything of a comic nature and i did try there is a lot of mafia clichÃ© but clichÃ© doesn't constitute humour in my book br br is it a romantic comedy of sorts never the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben afleck and jennifer lopez in gigli br br is it a cleverly devised parody about the mafia not in a million years the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap mafia movie it feels more like a homage than a parody br br with one dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces well it isn't enough even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression jack nicholson repleat with puffed up top lip now is that meant to be a parody of brando's padded jowls in the godfather oh who cares all i know is it isn't funny br br throw in some slow plodding direction this film drags on for 2 hours some hopelessly daft and clichÃ©d dialogue such as you remember the camora well we're far bigger we'll track you down wherever you go and clichÃ©d mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say capiche prizzi's honor is far from being huston's masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work it's definitely one work in the great director's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the hudson river
<START> usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didn't enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a 3 10 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough
<START> this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine the immortal charles dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it br br the story is well known i won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another a rich stingy mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done br br george c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge br br not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery it's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between br br the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life bob cratchitt played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story a christmas carol is not a light story dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england's life and it's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others 10 10
<START> what an unusual movie br br absolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound br br facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire br br i sort of viewed these movies parts 1 and 2 as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dull br br but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i don't think its very educational either br br its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why che's band was moving around the way they did as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at br br i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is a sort of harper valley p t a with touches of the supernatural elvira cassandra peterson walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station's owner gets fresh with her she's now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt's death which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will a house in need of repairs a dog and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira only the local hunk daniel greene and a group of teenagers will befriend her elvira's uncle vinnie w morgan sheppard presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook but elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting and a couple very effective casseroles elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft and the showdown between her and her uncle the plot is pretty simple but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace elvira mistress of the dark is full of cute gross bawdy and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags puns props songs and parodies the film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers including edie mcclurg and jeff conaway of grease there are also nice special effects many people including myself wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film and the answer is delightfully yes
<START> if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art the actors and the direction of this film are both good br br the only trouble with the film as i can see it is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot br br given both the irreverence of today's movies as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre i think even cowgirls would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released

<START> this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it's great to see j beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the 90s and not even a good one in those standards br br
<START> vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android kris kristofferson and a warrior woman kathly long as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets no don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it however despite the disastrous casting kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long and kristofferson is playing a robot despite the miscasting kristofferson provides the few moments of interest lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack worst of all it ends in a what if sequel thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event br br out of 4 bad
<START> i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year it starts out almost as a thriller but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear also while i say this movie is a comedy it doesn't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be when i went into the theater i didn't know what to expect much more than a moustache but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well written script and a big moustache
<START> this reworking of anthony shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas having recently suffered through it on cable i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket director kenneth branagh writer harold pinter and star producer jude law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longer original br br michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead played in that version by laurence olivier both were nominated for best actor oscars but lost to marlon brando in the godfather looking puffy and washed out caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as batman's butler he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter what's next alfie ii or son of the man who would be king br br but then no one benefits from this inane adaptation by pinter who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffer's witty character interplay branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second rate nightclub neither the shadows nor the tight overacted close ups can help law overcome his dull screen persona the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller almost making you forget the purpose behind the title br br fans of the original stage production with anthony quayle and keith baxter and the olivier caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream the late mr shaffer who wrote the 1972 screenplay as well as hitchcock's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations must be turning in his grave wishing he could plan a real murder or two
<START> follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit this time the first african american cuba gooding after president truman desegregates the armed forces through the u s navy's deep sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot robert deniro if the program weren't bad enough it's got to be located in bayonne new jersey br br there's nothing wrong with the performances robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively cuba gooding raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south is the expectable paragon of rectitude the girls one could hardly call them women are charleze theron and lonette mckee they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense other decent performers powers boothe and hal holbrook have even more perfunctory roles br br that's about it almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer a ship is called a boat robert de niro salutes indoors uncovered after a brutal assault on hospital personnel he's transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted somebody shouts i'm outta here in the early 1950s maybe it was a common expression at the time if so my bad people address each other by rank lieutenant boatswain's mate commander as they do in the army whereas in the navy they are simple mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted i didn't bother to check if there was a rank called senior master chief in 1950 br br cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe everyone in the navy it seems hates negroes except for one guy from wisconsin he stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class it's like the scene in animal house in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh a black man and a blind kid br br gooding is an enlisted man a second class petty officer he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school in one of their arguments she pleads with him she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her quit the navy and lead a quiet life and just let life pass you by he retorts yes yes just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by you can wave to it from the golf course in boca raton br br these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii bombardier airial gunner that sort of thing cheap as they often were they had some educational features you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner here the technical details are skipped over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except boyle's law which we learned in high school chemistry br br i couldn't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn't exist if i got the mechanical problems right it was because i guessed correctly the direction is no help either the movie abounds in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had and the emergencies are confusing because they're ill focused br br why go on want to see a better example of this kind of movie almost any will do except maybe g i jane in which the abused hero is a heroin try the training camp scenes in the young lions there the victim is a jew or try from here to eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like cool hand luke no easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy br br thoroughly formulaic and not well done
<START> madison is not too bad Âif you like simplistic non offensive family friendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson muncey cantrell slovak etc prepare to be disappointed br br professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clichÃ© in the book i needn't repeat what they've said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in 1971 br br yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind numbing roar of six allison or rolls merlin aircraft engines wound up to rpm's never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you you didn't hear it you felt it real hydro buffs know exactly what i'm talking about there's none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical score br br and then there are the close up shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home town hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky salute from a bridge pier in reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock hard water at speeds above 150 mph br br as one reviewer so aptly put it the sport deserves better than this br br finally since another user brought up anachronisms i'll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field neither existed in 1971
<START> it's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist he's done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan not as successfully but based in as much fact br br once i realised this it ceased to gall me that jill scott an american singer actress is cast as mma ramotswe if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african she's not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose both women are far far too young for the roles they're playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scott's mma ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft rose's mma makutsi is an annoying motor mouthed bitch br br the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this he's a shining light in an ocean of suckage the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script br br to me mccall smith's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name mid sentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse br br the dialogue is now largely anglicised characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly mma makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery i'm surprised she doesn't have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card br br so what are we left with here it's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute non threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom nuggets it reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isn't true br br given that it's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however
<START> i read the comment of chris m grant from united states br br he wrote a fantastic documentary of 1924 this early 20th century geography of today's iraq was powerful br br i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a nation's battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures i am from this region of iran myself i am a bakhtiari br br chris i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment iran and irak are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican thanks br br ziba
<START> serious home alone karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene oh and the acting sucks too although i must say that the line sorry dude i have to take a major dump big time made me laugh my ass off
<START> i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet that and it had nicole kidman in it i absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking 'wow' br br refreshingly down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner the relationships in the film are believeable with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully the humour is subtle with some great 'office' like scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood br br overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation it's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships brit filmmaking at its best br br 9 10
<START> considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
<START> don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it's ambivalent about the japanese whaling industry which morally is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish haggis cull it stinks cos it's pretentious tosh the sort of up its own behind guff that gets modern art a bad name that said there are some stunning images but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted and then just when you thinks it's finished it starts again i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show barney's film works which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty old men in macs brigade but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard stroking bjork fans were to be honest everyone might have had a lot more fun if they'd just shown one of the pornoes
