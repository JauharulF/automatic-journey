<START> the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the end br br by that measure enchanted april is a resounding success as a film in general it succeeds quite well excellent ensemble cast well developed characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are first rate three must be mentioned josie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further deponent saith not
<START> i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of 70's rock i hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years br br bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit br br stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding well br br if you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you won't regret seeing this movie i know i don't even my family found it funny and that's saying something
<START> imagine that you could have anything you wanted go anywhere you wished be anything you'd ever dreamed of being through thought alone now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life what would you do would such powers be worth your soul this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher pike in the cage the now legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series famously deemed too cerebral and too cold by nbc brass and rejected the cage was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time and gene roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste with the result being this truly classic star trek episode which embeds the cage into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci fi stories ever filmed for the small screen star date 3012 the uss enterprise diverts to starbase 11 after mr spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise surprisingly the message cannot be from captain pike after all as he is now confined to a wheelchair mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident kirk and starbase commanding officer commodore mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery but before the matter can be cleared up spock for reasons as yet unknown commits an act of open mutiny kidnapping the helpless captain pike and hijacking the enterprise via a brilliantly thought out and timed plan aided by a few vulcan nerve pinches soon the enterprise is headed for the remote forbidden planet of talos iv mendez informs kirk that talos iv is under interdiction and any contact with the planet by starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself and kirk as well given that the captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities appalled kirk and mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone spock knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship is of course unable to consign the captain to certain death after ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested after having set the starship on an irreversible course to talos iv upon reassuming command kirk demands an explanation whereupon spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of starfleet commanding officers of whom there are three on board mendez kirk and the crippled invalid captain pike spock's encyclopedic knowledge of starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the federation and the inhabitants of talos iv a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under pike's command kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by pike himself who turns out to have been lured to talos iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously among the survivors is vina a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the talosians a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality after pike's capture the rest of the survivors vanish as none of them really existed except vina the episode ends when the tribunal learns that spock's evidence is in fact being transmitted to the enterprise directly from talos iv in violation of starfleet regulations starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions and we wonder what will happen next to be continued in a review of the menagerie part ii
<START> the story is about the life of common people from antwerp living their lives so i said it and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story the movie is fast like an mtv flick and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films so let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next deus barman picture
<START> this was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen the first part of the movie though strange has a light and amusing quality to it the journey begins on such a peaceful note detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia but that is misleading beyond belief the obvious social problems inbreeding and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie i can still hear bobby moaning in pain and i shudder at the thought lewis's leg made me wince yet while the movie was on the whole very disturbing and distressing it posed some interesting questions when is it moral or right to take another individual's life what can morality drive us to do or not do in some cases and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself whatever conclusions one may draw from the film it is an achievement in its own right despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome
<START> i like chris rock but i feel he is wasted in this film the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely when eddie murphy remade dr doolittle and the nutty professor he re did them totally so they became murphy films vehicles not just tepid remakes that's why they were successful if chris had done the same this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly so why does hollywood keep making junk like this because people go to see it because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place
<START> believe it or don't i have my very own dvd copy of this movie which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar i'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted br br pretty amazing set designs and costumes apparently much thought and effort went into their making the set designs are very mexican in stylization i liked them a lot and santa is impressive one of the more impressive santas in moviedom br br i'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience but somehow it comes across quite deranged in fact i'm left stunned at how deranged it is br br maybe it's the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weird br br did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns you didn't neither did i until i watched this movie one learns something new everyday br br is this movie actually worth watching now that's a tossup i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching you decide what you're going to do i dunno for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves now that's just wrong
<START> probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful dramatic episode in this case the superb balance of terror with a lighter affair shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci fi and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry the true triumph is trouble with tribbles in season 2 the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness br br diverting from the show's tradition the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode instead kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty a well deserved break after three months of incessant work the earth like planet a budget related fact is very appealing but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens dr mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work soon other people begin experiencing similar things a woman meets a don juan like character sulu has a run in with a samurai and kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy throw in a freakishly real looking tiger and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt br br the idea is a classic one idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest of course everything works out fine again come the end and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves most notably and ironically the otherwise hilarious william shatner and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new previously unseen things the definition of star trek's success br br 7 5 10
<START> this is one of the best military films ever made and it is great because of its focus on values it's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor loyalty love and determination br br gooding and deniro are superb in the lead roles it's wonderful to see the master chief's racism evolve toward respect and love through carl brashear's determination drive and yes sense of honor the title indicates the source of their bond i never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant carl lumbly's portrayal of carl's father mac brashear was in a way it's a cornerstone of the film in that it's carl's memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times br br i am selective about what films i purchase this is one of those rare ones that i want on my shelf it will be seen many times in the future i'm sure
<START> sure the plot isn't oldboy it seems the only great movies these days are amazingly shocking or high budget hyped in some way br br spin kick is a drama comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do regardless of what you expect from this film you're guaranteed to feel moved by the work pain and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience though comedic at times many moments and characters are rendered beautifully there's the old guard character who takes things too seriously the hoodlum turned good guy who just wants a second chance at life the meek team substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life and many other well rounded characters with their own problems but most importantly their own their hopes and dreams while the plot and the goals of the movie are simple these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter personal struggles br br in short this film will leave you feeling fresh determined and satisfied
<START> i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary kate's and ashley's characters sam and emma stanton they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately it's just not that easy for them to actually do i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed out big time and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now this movie is a real winner sincerely rick morris
<START> the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felix but they're under selling the film without knowing it this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce it's also damn funny from start to finish but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile
<START> at first this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw it it was like a bad dream a cosmic bore but i gave it a second chance then another and another etc i finally got addicted to this film due to it's dreamlike slow pace wonderful natural sets bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score which is made of some 70's progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor singer songwriter derek lamb the troubadour you should notice the song about hazel wood silver trout and lady vanishing in the air heard in the middle and near the end of the film there are some carnal scenes in the beginning wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth suzuki if that movie had been made by some repertoire directors like bergman lars von triers or jean luc goddard critics would have rolled on the floor raving about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of fellini's cinematic sh Â¤ t definitely not for the pretentious
<START> election is a chinese mob movie or triads in this case every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader and at first it seems a toss up between big d tony leung ka fai or as i know him the other tony leung and lok simon yam who was judge in full contact though once lok wins big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters this one is not an action movie it has its bloody moments when necessary as in goodfellas but it's basically just a really effective drama there are a lot of characters which is really hard to keep track of but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit a 100 year old baton which is the symbol of power i mentioned before changes hands several times before things settle down and though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70 minute mark there are still a couple big surprises waiting simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture br br election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards winning for best actor tony leung best picture best director johnny to who did heroic trio and best screenplay it also had nominations for cinematography editing film score which i loved and three more acting performances including yam
<START> of course the story line for this movie isn't the best but the dances are wonderful this story line is different from other astaire rogers movies in that neither one is chasing the other the dancing of fred and ginger is what makes this movie
<START> directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi battlefield baseball and jun'ichi yamamoto meatball machine is apparently a remake of yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one first of what is meatball machine a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema br br meatball machine follows the well known plot boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date boy finally meets girl girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg boy in turn does also transform into said thing and goes on a quest to save his love will he succeed who gives a damn as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied br br the plot is simple relatively clichÃ©d but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives and yes it too luckily shows more violence i'm happy acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either br br the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore like i haven't mentioned that enough already are the cyborg designs done by keita amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known the necroborgs as they are called in meatball machine look stunningly detailed without the usage of cgi amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal painfully awesome in their appearance able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws rocket launchers blood firing shotguns and so on and so on though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film necroborgs are a movie class br br meatball machine is tetsuo the iron man mixed up with alien all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode it's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking
<START> full house came to me when i was about 9 i remember seeing re runs of america's funniest home videos with bob saget and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house one day i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family it didn't seem too interesting at first but as i watched more and more ever night at 9 00 i would just be so into it br br this show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family sing alongs br br the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be it's still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone br br 10 10
<START> it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america's most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn't even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker a 1 out of 10
<START> this movie's one of my favorites it's not really any good but it's great to laugh at the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted eg manji can we ask you a few questions sure we think you can help us with the answers any fighting is more or less surrealistic make sure to watch for brock the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters he only has two lines but he's one of the best guys in the movie
<START> i love old burt reynolds movies they're funnier and better than every other movie combined they might as well have stopped making movies after cannonball run 2 but i guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones man this movie's good burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way burt and loni those were the days i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner i sure loved that advertisement plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace burty r is doing and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night if you can find this movie rent it and then never watch another movie again because i tell you right now there's no point
