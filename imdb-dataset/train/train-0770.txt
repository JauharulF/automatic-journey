<START> grand central murder 1942 dir s sylvan simon br br production mgm br br this mediocre 'b' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with simon as director surely he could have fit another red skelton film or two on his schedule anyway grand central murder is a shameless rip off of the thin man films minus the wit charm and chemistry of the leads we are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes bad acting and weary gags br br van heflin and virginia grey play nick and nora char er rocky and butch custer he's a pi and she's his wife and sleuthing partner they engage in humorous banter with each other see it's completely different already heflin's the only one here who hints at bigger and better things although he's real close to being a jerk in this virginia grey was in another thin man but again let me stress this film is nothing like that one no sir and just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film say the thin man we actually like sam levene pops up as the lead detective who's kind of dim and has to have van heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads hmmm br br quickly the 'murder' is that of bitchy schemer mida king who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one she's played by patricia dane who's like a c version of hedy lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into an f there's a whole array of wacky suspects all with their own motivation for wanting mida dead there's the society type the tough talking dames the thug the ex lover and a shady theater impresario tom conway here saddled with the unlikely character name of 'frankie ciro' roman bohnen plays a nervous jittery type something i believe he may have done before millard mitchell plays an idiot cop who in a running gag that won't quit can't stop thinking about the piece of ass he's got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up that's right millard mitchell swordsman finally in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling something we've never seen before all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories as flashbacks to the detective as rocky takes mental notes until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession br br on top of the actual picture being a dud i naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942 era grand central but alas no there's merely one very brief shot at the beginning thanks for nothing grand central murder so to sum up a wee bit formulaic but heflin was okay br br Â½ out of 4
<START> revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow and i mean slow build up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader and when that finally comes it's pretty all right not great not even good but pretty all right this movie is being vastly over praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels instead it's just turgid dull and routine but you have to say wow those cgi environments are really impressive at times bu the lightsabre fights they're all a blurry mess i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed this will make a ton of money but thank god it's over this once worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough i saw the 12 01 show and after it i heard a group of very small kids say wow that was awesome but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing i fell asleep in the middle it was kind of boring i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better so said we all
<START> sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i've seen in a long while rife with amazing cg and special effects studded with an a list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi and racing along with an overused but indiana jones esquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watch br br 'should have' being the key term here of course br br jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder heart melting smirks but you can't make something out of nothing and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said good boy dex just one more time i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow as polly perkins is nothing less than nerve grating her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book heroine who knows i expected more from her an example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late 90's flick the phantom starring kristy swanson and billy zane rent the movie and you'll know what i mean br br giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch i'll admit it in just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry two dimensional castmates br br the plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie and a snail's pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well the pairing is rather clichÃ©d also polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly ended romance and their story isn't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film nobody's surprised and nobody really cares either br br props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout but sky captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face not even worth the 2 75 i paid to get into the theater
<START> going into this movie i had heard good things about it coming out of it i wasn't really amazed nor disappointed simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies there were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too funny probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club a couple of stars here and there including megan fox kirsten dunst that chick from x files and jeff bridges i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg run fatboy run i see it as a toss up you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull i might add kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie 3
<START> atlantis is probally the best disney movie that i have seen in years it has great action scene magic an intelligent and weel written script atlantis brings back the magic of the disney classics such as the lion king or alladin after seeing this one i'm sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be great br br i recommend to you all alantis the lost empire is like a breath of inspiration br br 9 out of 10
<START> i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols and that is the reason i came watching this film br br the uniqueness of this film compared to other modern rockumentaries is that it's not just about one page of a band's history like i am trying to break your heart about wilco but rather covers long period of the band's history in this movie director producer ondi timoner closely followed friends rivals the brian jonestown massacre bjm and the dandy warhols dw for more than 8 years 1995 2003 and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video cut than to 1 45 hours the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film the result is astonishing there are no fillers the film is 100 pure and genuine archive footage which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands through all these years br br both bands in the start of their careers promised to make a revolution in the music making and not to sell their souls to the devil of record industry however their paths quickly diverged the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular especially in europe after only one album while the brian jonestown massacre with its self destruction bound leader anton newcombe dissolved into oblivion at least how it is portrayed in the film and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols br br first i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe for example courtney taylor the leader of the dandy warhols narrates but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film br br first it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project in the end he was ignored completely as if he was kicked out of the project everybody talk about bjm but he does not take part in the discussion i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process there are always both sides of the story and here we have only one of course as one would expect anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends br br second the film is very dandy warhols biased sure the winner takes it all but the fact that courtney taylor leader of dw narrates even though it seems a good choice it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally bjm is covered till 1997 and dw till 2003 does not add objectivity to the film br br third the movie is somewhat shallow what does it want to teach us as one critic said movie examines old questions where does genius fit into a commodified world can it thrive and get its due or does it need to self destruct to preserve its integrity no it does not examine these questions it just depicts a story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician narrated by a less brilliant but successful one who indulges in self assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain br br anyway the movie was fun it's raw it's fresh it's stylish it's just god damn interesting at least for the dw or bjm fans for the rest of the crowd i don't know
<START> i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality but this one got on my nerves it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about psychological trauma and mental illness the psycho mom thing has been done too many times before and usually done better and much of the rest of the plot is far fetched as well the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about br br one highlight i am a long time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular jon lindstrom br br anyway if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it in the same way a person must suspend reality judgment when watching a lot of movies then this movie might be tolerable if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards br br i'm sorry i spent my time watching it
<START> of course i was watching bg i loved s1 i liked season 2 season 3 was ok and loved the final one yay there is a spin off show i didn't know about this at all one of my friends told me about this i was really excited br br i watched the first 3 episodes what a piece of rubbish teenage girl drama fest there is no science fiction well hardly any at the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a cylon that's all who cares this did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18 boring religious nonsense talking moaning bitching and some more br br it is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch stargate ruined bg over
<START> i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality overall however i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying even sickening overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u s military against various malcontents br br the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and conclusions a depressing movie not a true film a term i reserve for true art that left me with a bad feeling do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content form and conclusion any association with this genre br br i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources
<START> i don't understand how 2 of us receive such a high rating i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble however i did like jared harris' performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours
<START> it's not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is it's pretty amusing the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad i have to be honest if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage it's not made to be taken seriously it's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills most of which are ultra gory it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry
<START> geniuses william cameron menzies and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film with ambition and scope hard to find today they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race they change the timing in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing we even see an helicopter the film is older than them br br unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem romans with bubble helmets if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s well's vision of a rationalistic society interesting reflections on the nature of power and john cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it br br 9 1 2 out of 10 inspiring like that final monologue by john cabal
<START> i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy and predictable film but i decided to put that aside when watching well when it was over i was just left stunned mainly in tears by how great the man in the moon turned out to be this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone and its just a fabulous film the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon who was so cute and lovable and everyone else there wasn't anything that really bothered me i felt the ending kinda predictable but very well done at that also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before but still a great film overall i must say i don't to much to say about this film not that it was bad its just a film you either like or don't like i would however recommend this to any and everyone even if you don't like these type of films its still an enjoyable film br br 8 7 out of 10 stars
<START> despite what others had said cough this is my favourite movie of all time i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it but once i finally did i immediately fell in love sure it's strange but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour for those who don't know moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies they haven't done very many at all maybe 3 or 4 tops each so give them some credit we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and whatnot therefore i have given and always shall give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd and honestly its one of the best classes i've had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film
<START> my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actors actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasn't that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn's last movies i'll always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here
<START> it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source br br here's a review without pretensions br br just when you think nothing is going to happen it doesn't br br dress it up any way you like this is a dull film full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest br br one to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like so deep man br br not something to watch for your own pleasure though br br unless br br you're br br pretentious
<START> this is a trio of tales shakti devi and kali about an experimental commune or some such thing called the taylor eriksson group which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown and left a bit of damage here and there i'd say many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously in fact he was torn apart and the suspect was a man that may not have existed seems this woman is able to project some inner demon or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to jump out of his skin he's a skinhead a speed freak and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire this is probably the best of the three segments kali tells the tale of a healer who attempts to heal this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness this has a sort of low budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout much to its credit i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares and gore came it hit pretty hard i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot a good little find this one i'd give it 8 out of 10
<START> w somerset maugham's of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic if so much must have been missing from the film version here phillip's leslie howard attraction to mildred bette davis is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post breakup retelling of a relationship from the man's point of view being a family lawyer i've heard many such accounts the man depicts himself as noble and always correct and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man br br indeed unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker this is an uncomfortable movie to watch phillip even indulges mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred enraged and now of dubious sanity the free run of his flat with predictable results bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life but that period didn't occur here in fact by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later br br i note how howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed it tells me that phillip craves middle class respectability someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough phillip is for most of the movie a student such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status an english raskolnikov as it will and balanced that by allowing mildred a modicum of charm
<START> this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a cafÃ© to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
