<START> a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon and in the process of trying to escape he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised soldiers are able to retrieve the case but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out they eventually make it to where he's hiding and cleanse the hotel and its occupants unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation and if you've seen return of the living dead you know what happens next br br zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike as a complete mess of a movie while that's a fair assessment it's not without it's high points for one thing it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore hounds happy there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible they're in the water the rafters of houses hiding in trees and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator you have to see it to believe it as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind zombi 3 fits that bill and then some it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like minded friends i give it an 8 10 just because of sheer enjoyment
<START> i was so disgusted by this film i felt obligated to warn off others this film has no story plot or hint of purpose the film starts after the standard lets be scary movie intro which by now every film watcher has become accustomed so we can ignore the beginning completely we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static unless you have seen white noise eek acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came having said that even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up eccentric writer who probably considers himself to be an artist has resulted in a film which will test your patience it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said we have been watching this for 45 mins did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience rather than suggest what the film is missing let me tell you what it has dumb blonde surprise surprise victims bad monster guy thing about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours days weeks months and credits br br want a silver lining well the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film
<START> i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a re make you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film visually musically and emotionally br br visually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with sofia and at other times powerful and intense times square post climactic scenes br br the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream like theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about 60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself crowe's other musical selections such as the beach boys josh rouse spiritualized sigur ros the monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film crowe has an ear for great music br br more importantly the emotional themes in this film i e love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again br br the best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something new so watch closely and be prepared to think sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you think br br this is easily cameron crowe's best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my film making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itself br br bottom line vanilla sky is in a league of its own
<START> yet another movie about a group of less than intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short cut or in this case to visit a run down side show attraction the results as expected are not at all good as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic in bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before the father who is apparently a professionally photographer just has to stop and take pictures of the place only to find that it still inhabited the various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions only to be scared away thinking they made it safely on their way the van tire explodes surprise leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks surprise br br this film plays out as expected with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks there is some fighting back on the families part but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film as they are badly executed there is nothing remotely original here unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film the acting is about as bad as i have seen in quite some time by everyone involved it is pretty bad when your cast is out acted by the cast of camp blood the special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television br br still though despite all the negatives i somewhat enjoyed this film it definitely has a so bad it's good vibe to it i made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once i got past the ridiculously clichÃ©d plot terrible acting and cheesy special effects though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless br br bottom line i can list countless films that if you have seen them you have seen this the difference is most of those film are better though not a complete waste this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary br br my grade d
<START> if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie it's got to be pretty good i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death the english patient shakespeare in love atonement crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flash back technique very affective there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a rip off of orson
<START> this is the best movie i've seen since white and the best romantic comedy i've seen since the hairdresser's husband an emotive beautiful masterwork from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter it is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more recognition
<START> this was a pretty good movie i liked it i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words it's not about you to her mother those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie
<START> this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships br br eventually they do become spoken but is there a chance to change anything about the situation br br originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film br br a young married couple liyan an invalid and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined br br a bright contrast is liyan's young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved br br into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor br br i ended up feeling quite sad but definitely a superior film
<START> with adam sandler br br this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made it's about cruise ship waiter shecky sandler wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly it is so unfunny it's pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but the f word is plentiful the budget is really low and that also ruins the film it takes place on a cruise ship but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras one of which is billy bob thornton the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply and it is just pathetic i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too br br 86 mins rated r for language
<START> i just realised i've been using imdb for years now and i've never reviewed my favourite film by favourite i don't mean something i like for now i mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it this is obvious because i am never going to be a child again i saw this film on itv in the early nineties i was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at i'm also male the gender that this film is intended for the overwhelming majority of miyazaki's protagonists are female consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and i am forever indebted to carl macek sp for producing the english dub of this film which is far superior to the di ney production which is not even funny i've never even been able to watch that one of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the macek version is so good the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original japanese actors that this version is available on the japanese dvd it's not available on any distribution in an english speaking country go figure br br there are hundreds of competent reviews so i'm going to put some trivia here not that i'm the definitive archive of information for this film br br first up i'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review miyazaki's films they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on imdb combined pale into insignificance br br the fascinating story with this film is that miyazaki based the countryside around slag's ravine pazu's town area on the welsh mining communities he visited wales for a few months in the early 80s might be late 70s just after one of the great mining strikes being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight the fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man the countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where i grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest british isles br br the island is of course from swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century the story in swift's book is deliberately ridiculous in castle in the sky miyazaki weaves together myths such as atlantis and the tower of babel i think the architecture in addition is based on peruvian ruins though i'm not sure someone told me that br br anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film really will want to check out miyazaki's epic series mirai shounen conan future boy conan based on the short sci fi novel 'the incredible tide' by alexander key novel is available online conan is basically a prototype for laputa's pazu and shita in addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for masterpiece theatre some of his key frame animation he also did key frame for sherlock hound this has some of the finest backgrounds i've ever seen too also check out miyazaki and takahata's first feature film horus prince of the sun 1968 amazing by today's standards in fact what else gauche the cellist and the flying ghost ship though they're pretty rare br br this film is such a gift i don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around this is like an oasis arigatou miyazaki sensei
<START> i haven't yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen overall i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut's novels it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi's and send secret messages to the american's via his weekly radio show but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york where various odd plot twists await br br if mother night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell very much recommended
<START> except for the brady variety hour this was some of the hokiest television i've seen in a while the video production qualities weren't too bad but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80's and marie osmond looks like she did battle with the avon lady and lost big time way too much eyeliner br br it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase that would be opening 'in about a year ' br br as of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasn't opened yet unless you count disney's animal kingdom all in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of disney history
<START> a highly atmospheric cheapie showing great ingenuity in the use of props sets and effects fog lighting focus to create an eerie and moody texture the story is farfetched the acting is merely functional but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative this movie is recommended for its mood and texture not for its story
<START> i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie it wasn't horrible nor was it great but it was enjoyable to watch i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times they made the grinch seem like a special education person when all he needed to be was evil and devious but yet he turned out kind of retarded i did think the scenery when not inside the grinch's cave was beautiful and there was a few parts where i laughed but most of the time i thought it was just annoying this movie could've been so much better if they had changed the grinch's personality and they had included some more laugh scenes because most of the humor wasn't funny i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway but it's not anything to get excited about seeing
<START> at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film basically forgetful ex comedians willy clark golden globe winner and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau and al lewis oscar winning and golden glove nominated george burns were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show willy's nephew ben clark golden globe winning richard benjamin is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other how wrong he is they cannot get on all the time they are both forgetful especially during conversation but they do it eventually also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch miss mcintosh carol deluise as mrs doris green al's daughter rosetta lenoire as odessa willy's nurse and muppets from space's f murray abraham as mechanic i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard it was nominated the oscars for best art direction set decoration and best writing screenplay adapted from other material it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay and it won the golden globe best motion picture musical comedy and it was nominated for best screenplay very good
<START> i didn't expect much when i first saw the dvd cover i mean pierce brosnan as grey owl br br ah but then the story got underway unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film i was surprised and delighted at this basically true story made me want to read more about this fascinating character which means the director fulfilled his purpose and the film was a success
<START> the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing guess that location what toronto landmark will stand in for what american international location br br who knew that the anti christ would be russian obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day oh buck you'll tell us all the truth you'll show us the light and the way outta the building should those nasty anti christers get their way br br five golden raspberries faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk we don't gotta prayer
<START> more of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in mediocre overall br br it starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed goes into the room of her crying child and kills it she wakes up then that man is dying in a hospital spitting up blood his estranged daughter arrives and he manages to contact her through her dreams i think and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave br br there's not too much mystery about who did it or even how most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed i'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked br br anyway the horror elements get in through a gory autopsy the recurring dream of the man killing the boy a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave br br i was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by fulci to clive barker interesting
<START> a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and imagine the suspense here experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family the earnestness exuded by the mrs whitfield character has to be seen to be believed well the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school none of these people can act as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on pause to remember lines and have all the conviction of a paper bag the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends but by that time i didn't care the murders are not convincing either and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are cheap doesn't even begin to describe the budget here with it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods someone lent the director a couple old cars too no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make up there are so many guffaws ridiculous moments to list but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved 1 watch the gardener's body well after he has been slain len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life 2 the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method 3 how about the guy playing roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's andy griffith the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70's cheese if you will this isn't a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing
<START> this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time br br the swimming instructor is an almost olympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students he attempts more or less to fend them off with varying results br br the students characters are mainstream u s a teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys br br this is a good date movie or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality
