<START> from the opening shots of the lead actor we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of 'normal' life br br eric lartigau the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives yet without the help support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work the use of facial image throughout the film is superb and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family mother is spot on br br while there are more than enough laughs in the movie it still deals with single parents adoption and the strength of family in society truly rewarding to watch and again one that only the french seam capable to make br br so far one of the best 50 or so films i have seen this year and well worth a five start rating i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages
<START> bar some of the questionable acting there musicians at the end of the day this in the words of quentin tarrinno is the best rock movie ever made period br br think 8 mile but without the rapping a young musician trying to prove himself to the local community whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances this is the real 8 mile br br prince provides a solid performance as does morris day and jerome benton decent script good direction great plot and spectacular performances not forgetting the some of the best rock pop funk music you will ever hear
<START> horror movie really i cant believe how bad this movie was what the point of this movie the movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident not much talking at all not even much actions at all i have to say tho the last 20 minuets it got little tiny action and was still stupid and the end oh my god i don't know where to begin it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol don't get me wrong i love lena headey i think she is great actress but i don't know what got into her to do this movie don't waste your time and watching it because this movie has no story has no acting and has no point not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever
<START> the movie concerns about philip leslie howard he's a serious but handicapped medicine student he falls fatally in love with a heartless predatory waitress called mildred bette davis she leaves him engaging with others alan hale reginald denny meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors kay johnson frances dee but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair br br easily the best and first of numerous films versions of somerset maugham's novel bette davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale davis rose the stardom with her performance her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting leslie howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance he was an awesome actor gone with the wind besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during wwii both will play again in Â¨petrified forestÂ¨ 1936 the atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the rko radio picture inc studio is entirely convincing remade in 1946 by edmund goulding with eleanor parker and paul henreid and in 1964 by ken hughes with kim novak and laurence harvey the motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs rating very good but a little bit dated
<START> prix de beautÃ© was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound which came a little later in europe than in hollywood originally conceived as a silent it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in france with a french actress speaking louise brooks' lines but was released as a silent in italy and other parts of europe i was lucky enough to see the cineteca di bologna's flawless new restoration of an italian silent print at the tribeca film festival i haven't seen the talkie version yet but i think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done louise brooks is clearly speaking english so there's no way her lips could be matched also the film is made entirely in the silent style with few titles and little need for dialogue prix de beautÃ© tells its story visually with exciting imaginative camera work the opening is instantly kinetic with rapidly cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail on clothing machinery decoration and symbolic images such as a caged bird a heap of torn photographs a diamond bracelet this is silent film technique at its pinnacle br br louise brooks of course is responsible for saving the film from obscurity seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role lustrously beautiful she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance her role here more than in the pabst films for which she's best known is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with she plays lucienne garnier a typist with a possessive fiancÃ© who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success she is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him all of the characters are drawn with nuance the fiancÃ© inspires pity and is not merely a brute he loves lucienne but is a limited man who can't cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men even the other man in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancÃ©'s br br warning spoilers below br br the film has many fine set pieces including lucienne's triumph in the miss europe contest shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers her misery as a housewife peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her a nightmarish trip to a fun fair in the silent version this occurs late in the film after her marriage at which lucienne crushed among the low lifes and depressed by her husband's macho antics decides that she can't go on with her present existence and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test louise brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile her shoulders swathed in white fur her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen the double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still living image on the screen is particularly poignant louise brooks' image like lucienne's remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career
<START> while the movie does feel a bit long at times it is well worth it gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles merciless thoughtful ironic quirky and dark this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while begging for answers to impossible questions nolte goodman and arkin are all incredible sheryl lee is wonderful as well in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura maddy days do not miss this one
<START> i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin 'die hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'cliffhanger' one of the most awesome action movies ever that's right you little punks 'cliffhanger' rules and we all know it br br sly plays gabe walker a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend hal tucker michael rooker assist in a rescue on a mountain peak walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen john lithgow qualen co have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u s government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back br br essentially 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face first into several rock faces with no apparent side effects after all isn't that what action movies are all about br br 'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around a showcase of great scenes and stunts one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever br br 'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts definitely renny harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie 9 10
<START> i'll keep the review of this program as short as possible skip it low budget not funny lousy script acting not quite as bad as the writing but still bad that's all you need to know but i will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary br br this is a film with three segments each one parodying some other type of movie a much funnier film with this same exact idea is movie movie with george c scott very obscure but worth searching out mm parodied films of the 1930's and did it with elegance precision and dry wit br br this movie did not it parodies three types of films supposedly from the late 70's early 80's era only it is parodying films i've almost never heard of the first is i guess a parody of kramer vs kramer in a way peter reigert does his best with a dirt poor script the second is a parody of i don't know what a danielle steele novel i mean you might see a story like this on lifetime tv but in a movie theater i mean i remember the 70's i was there this is a soap opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power these type of things usually parody themselves so i don't see how this was even necessary br br we are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment the municipalians which parodies cop movies i noted elements of the new centurians and some dirty harry both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created yeah nice and current robby benson plays the idealistic young rookie over the top wimpy while richard widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car oh stop my sides he's actually drinking booze in the police car how irreverent note that this was the first film after animal house to have the national lampoon name attached wow to go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking i could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting edge and original voices in american humor that would be national lampoon the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so to sell out and begin a long slow slide into a world of crap where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low budget comedy films for a fee yet another reason why capitalism and cocaine sucks so bad br br anyway this movie is a serious time suck don't waste your 90 minutes i want mine back on the positive side fred willard's in it
<START> i just watched this movie on showtime quite by accident actually if i wouldn't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie i wouldn't have known what i was missing but i would've missed a lot br br that's the way this movie is it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect that and causality hence my verbiage above ever character is intertwined in some way or another action reaction interaction non interaction this movie is just wonderful i'm going to have to find a copy to buy
<START> ritchie's first two films were snappy stylish entertainment here he raids two recent classics Â 'the usual suspects' and 'fight club' Â and still comes out empty handed br br despite parading itself as a con mystery with the sub 'usual suspects' twaddle the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you or whatever it was and attempting a 'fight club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half by the last third you know you're being lead down a blind alley and tediously slowly at that br br cons chess and game theory are all great subjects but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material br br the only thing that keeps the movie almost watchable is ritchie's bold way with with a scene and maurice jones's dynamic camera if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot and succumbed to tighter editing there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper br br as it is revolver is a waste of your time incomprehensibility does not equal profundity if you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it and incidentally which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement watch 'lost highway'
<START> this was an awful movie basically jane march was a half korean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea she becomes a maid for an american military family they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white i believe the actress is either 1 4 or 1 8 southeast asian not at all korean and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her the way korea and the u s military in korea is depicted is completely insane of course the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie anyone who's ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage in the end the north korean honhyol spy girl gets killed in an obvious paying for her sins way very bad film with a made for tv feel to it
<START> i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema i'd seen fritz lang's film on video some years ago i'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic br br conditions were ideal at cinematheque ontario pristine full length print intertitles in the original gothic script german with simultaneous english translation accurate without being too literal live piano accompaniment ideal br br the film's magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch at least for me br br this film bears no real relation to wagner's ring cycle as i already knew but some may not wagner had adapted the 13th c niebelungenlied to his own purposes part i of fritz lang's epic siegfried has much that will be familiar to listeners of wagner however br br kriemhild's revenge is the story of siegfried's wife kriemhild her marriage to king etzel attila the hun and her desire for revenge against hagen and gunther the rechristened nibelungs for the murder of siegfried the spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the wagnerian mythos into his gÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung his twilight of the gods and the end of valhalla this film remains earthbound br br most of the film is spectacular the massive sets rival those of cabiria 1914 which inspired griffith's intolerance 1916 their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour there's a huge cast of scarred mangy huns and art deco burgundians and battles battles that never seem to end in fact br br kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge she manages to destroy all around her her loyalty to her martyred siegfried seems not to stem so much from love or devotion but from something closer to psychosis lady macbeth cried out unsex me here she knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do but kriemhild displays no normal human emotions and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle she is already top full of direst cruelty to borrow shakespeare's phrase from the outset margarethe schÃ¶n and her director convey this with a glower i don't want to exaggerate but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to animate kriemhild's face it's the ultimate in one note performances it's clearly intentional however not simply a case of poor acting br br what we have then on offer is a one dimensional sketch of an avenging fury some might see kriemhild as an empowered heroine i just see the film as misogynistic
<START> maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a buffoon but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever there's a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creature killer whatever entrails of a virgin has neither it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie even if isn't one of the very worst ever made it's there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads br br in this case we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by a murderer as he's credited first off the director kazuo 'gaira' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like it's from another movie then once settled into the house there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him 'all' there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like d'amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one br br now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the croÃ»tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eye gouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl whose inconsequential name i can't remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through 'gaira' and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the 'i hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether
<START> sweet sixteen 1983 86 minutes director jim sotos cast bo hopkins susan strasberg aleisa shirley patrick macnee dana kimmell br br fifteen year old bad girl melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off the detective has to put together the clues with the help of his nancy drew good girl daughter played by friday the 13th alumni dana kimmell the local native americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk these events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at melissa's sixteenth birthday party br br this below average slasher isn't too memorable it has a made for tv feel without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout lines like the killer will turn us into coleslaw fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays marci calls melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship apparently marci sees how hard it is to fit in because melissa knows how to wear make up this movie would be hard pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close ups of her the social commentary on indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets both sweet sixteen and ed hunt's bloody birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but i feel failed to deliver but on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on dvd gives hope that others will follow
<START> loved this show smart acting smart dialog great storyline with real people please bring it back or make it available online really miss it hope davis really shines in this show i like the idea of six degrees it really makes sense in this insane world rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to grovel but please when it went off the air i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal interruptions in fact online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime time gone are the days of endless taping anytime you want to bring it back i am ready
<START> ok this movie so far has been slated by critics and board posters alike although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film makers and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics so i wanted to sit in guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it br br the film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is this has been described many times as as making the film inaccessible to the viewer the film's chronology is relatively non linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle or not so subtle hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory ie ray liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words fear me is portrayed as both tragically pathetic from statham's pov or interrogating and bold from liotta's pov this is but one example of ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film making with revolver we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal the strong but silent gritty anti hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption i mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice overs but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points br br take the scene where jason statham's character runs afoul of a car this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death br br so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling i'd be taking the p ss if i said i didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going uh wtf but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand and even easier to say well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film in my humble opinion revolver is a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers if we choose this opportunity to collectively say ah sh t i wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in nit loll guy ritchie is a tit then the day will come when film makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow crappy people just because guy made a name for himself with funny cheeky cockney romps doesn't mean he can't be deep without being pretentious funny people can be thoughtful too
<START> this was an exteremely good historical drama john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affectations such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover natalia br br the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' i e 'lolita' are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
<START> our teacher showed us this movie in first grade i haven't seen it since i just watched the trailer though does this look like a first grade movie to you i don't think so i was so horrified by this movie i could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup i was freaked out by this film now today being 20 i probably would not feel that way i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie even though it's pg be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids i don't even remember what it was about once was enough
<START> i just finished watching going overboard i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min adam sandler could not find a better project than this as for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was 10 000 and they were way under did wallmart get a good deal on this every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore
<START> michael williams who works for bbc finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art a documentary but since his wife's mysterious death her daughter emily has been emotionally disturbed so he goes spoleto where the problematic picture is with her and her nanny jill and there is a countess who is also a psychic and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed michael doesn't believe her story but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed this italian film is of course almost innocently influenced by the exorcist but this one is much cheaper much simpler and in a sense much dirtier first of all it should be said this film is full of confusion for instance the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia but when emily sees her in the flashbacks she perceives her exclusively from a third person's point of view but if she is the reincarnation of emilia she should and must see the past from nothing but emilia's point of view confusions of this kind which the film has many are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly rather than ambivalent to specify its own quasi freudian theme namely pre adolescent girl's one way incestuous wish to make matters worse this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and or believable living human regarding emily or emilia she is after all a child and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness and according to the freudian theory every girl wants to have her father's child ren in her own way in this sense emily is not exclusively pathological only her way of excluding other women from her father's love is problematically pathological but as i already mentioned this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down to earth and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way in addition special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable although stelvio cipriani's music is noteworthily beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b film which can disappoint even the 1970s' italian horror film lovers
