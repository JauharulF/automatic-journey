<START> i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie what i would like to say is that 'distortion' was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005 festival 'cinÃ©ma tout Ã©cran' where it won the award of the audience 'prix du public'in french for what affects me i liked the 'nervous camera' work of mr bouzaglo who in my opinion portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie this perspective however might seem totally 'alien' to an israeli viewer but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper i'm translating from french ''after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living we are like the characters in my movie ''on the edge of the edge'' this is the reason why the private detective who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie because he earns a living thanks to the system he takes advantage of this situation'' this is in substance the main thing that i and the swiss public in my opinion pointed out in this movie and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor so to sum up different country different perspective but i think that this is somehow great because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking
<START> small spoilers alert br br good movie very good movie and i'm surprised to say that myself because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action this movie really fascinated me good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved it really is the story that keeps you focused especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle of course that's where the reality and the based on a true story stops the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker br br in this movie the count vlad teppish emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman and they're all pretty girls i'll give him that overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr heck it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title these two films have nothing else in common but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture check it out my humble opinion on to die for 8 5 10
<START> i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years beginning with season 1 episodes back in 2003 2004 and while most have been good this particular episode was not only the best of the best but has few rivals in the emmy categories though some may not agree with the story content i e the male to male romantic relationship i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit br br the story is essentially about a case that was reopened based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer the two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named sean coop aka the cold case victim who goes by his last name coop and his partner jimmy bruno br br in the story coop is single a vietnam war vet with a deeply troubled past jimmy however is married with children no less both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time br br the flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout examples include their red squad car the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in jimmy's bedroom where jimmy's wife watched coop and jimmy drink fight and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol induced state i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes with everything else in black and white i still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale br br the clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of jimmy's baby in this scene coop's father sarge who was a respected fellow officer on the force confronts coop about the rumors surrounding coop's relationship with jimmy one can feel sorry for coop at this point as the shame and disgrace of coop's father was heaped upon coop you are not going to disgrace our family and you're not my son either clearly indicative of the hostile views of same sex relationships of that era br br additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled batman and robin homos br br as for the relationship between coop and jimmy it's obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life once can see the tension in jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids his church and yet his undying devotion to coop br br in the end jimmy walks away from coop realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time sadly coop is killed perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force br br the most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner jimmy we were the lucky ones don't forget that br br the soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett playing the still grieving jimmy only much older by now and clearly still missing his former partner coop br br i highly recommend this episode and consider it the best it is without a doubt the most well written well acted and well done of all cold case episodes that i've ever seen
<START> i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinne's movie credits excellent dark and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as crowhaven farm don't be afraid of the dark and satan's school for girls all lost satanic classics i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood's classic high plains drifter why don't they release these great little movies especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal mart most of these flicks have a cult following so sales shouldn't be a problem
<START> i love this show it's like watching a mini movie each week the first episode was so gripping and terrifying so was part 2 of the pilot i'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show this is the real survivor i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf sorry if it's not another reality show kiddies there was once a time where there were now brace yourself actual tv shows and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump teenth carbon copy of a law order or nypd blue or csi series they're dishing out watch this yourself to form your own opinion don't take one from the boneheads here
<START> this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short light hearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema it's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didn't even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
<START> anyone who has read my review for uwe boll's alone in the dark will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out well take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine do that and you'll have a general idea of what eli roth's cabin fever is all about br br i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the worst film ever made but in all honesty i have to say cabin fever comes very close this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life how do you screw up a story like this think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here this script failed on so many levels with me and while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre br br to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it and that is one element i normally go for there really was nothing about cabin fever that i could easily recommend to anybody when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again
<START> movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like repetitive boring and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones i am glad that aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this p o s go back and watch the 1971 version count the things that would never be included in a modern version and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day
<START> its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie and it gets old telling people it's rap's version of spinal tap and you know im sorry i dont have any better comments but damnit go get the movie and watch it and then make all your friends watch it too just like im gonna
<START> this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity anne reid previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including 'dinnerladies' a victoria wood scripted series on in company catering workers if you're wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may a late 60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner london borough her husband toots peter vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family may's teacher daughter paula cathryn bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london she is able to stay in paula's house and do some child minding of paula's more appreciative offspring br br it is on may's visits to bobby's house that she embarks on an affair with darren a mid 30s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it it is may and not darren daniel craig who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect there is no explicit sexual content at least in the dvd i saw differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula a recent convert to 'therapy and self exploration' who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her paula is also darren's lover and when she finds may's explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion only in an english film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop her br br in the mean time may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of paula's writing group the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula and darren's worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride so may finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new br br the film's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent sibling relationships where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no one to care for them this is not new but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over 60s may well be the darkness of the film's content from a screenplay by hanif kureishi stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit it seems to be perpetual summer and the overall mood is uplifting it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england the ending is perhaps under written as we don't know where may is going or for how long perhaps she's shirley valentine with a pension she's certainly no picasso anne reid is however revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever like julie andrews in torn curtain said by paul newman there goes your mary poppins read dinnerladies image for good br br yes he announced oct 2005 as the new james bond
<START> so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film looking at the card i turned to my wife and said how many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb only about 5 for me but then watching the interaction between peter falk and paul reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film's setting of new york state i slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film the movie jumped to the excellent level br br by the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the grinch's and i ended up giving this a superb br br this picture is a must for anyone who has parents no violence or nudity but some strong language
<START> smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville it's my favorite episode of smallville
<START> first off i'm a dedicated fan of modesty's and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one rocks br br well then here we go ms blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives if the robber wins one round she'll have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well i'm not that good at explaining either br br she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape living by nature's own rules they hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for rebellions they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herself br br then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for and there the story ends br br what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the line's are totally cool alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise just as modest and strong graceful and intellectual as the comic one br br feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but that's not relevant since the comic book blaise can't speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking english in the balkan br br the acting is really good even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud br br my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass totally awesome d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s br br watch it you won't be disappointed
<START> harem suare is the best film i saw in the year 2000 bravo ferzan ozpetek sensually shot and stunningly portrayed harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance which is such a taboo in hollywood women of all shapes sizes and color populate the film cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and jealousies within their ranks
<START> i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good and that it has some slow parts but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun first of all the performances are great michael douglas kim basinger kiefer sutherland and eva longoria michael douglas proves he has still got it and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife kiefer sutherland and eva longoria play the dynamic duo both adding their incredible talent to the pot and second of all this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore its plain and simple if you want to go to the movies and have a lot of fun see the sentinel
<START> once again the same familiar story about a man writer here who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life success unfunny script we should go home and write better ridiculous lines in order to understand the strong christmanish message our only aspiration in life is to find love respect and a good friendship and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil jennifer love hewitt is no sexy or evil at all for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character not bad efforts from the actors baldwin also as a director cattrall in a sex and the city role again aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role p s try also a not so popular film from greece called alloimono stous neous a brilliant adaptation of this myth an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth
<START> unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie my points br br film is based on 2 things br br 1 ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture but unfortunately it is not enough knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that lebanese people are christian ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism so we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film br br 2 sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong br br i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre please watch dr strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it where is the truth where is the meaning about the movie
<START> having first watched the movie at 14 i remember being struck by hearing the word 'govno' sh t for the first time ever on the then still soviet tv i bet it really was the first time in history Â anyone wants to add this to trivia section what an open boldness and freedom i thought as years passed i was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my 14 y o impression helplessness there's an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie of primitive degenerate tide embodied by sharikov sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas it's a great metaphor of russian revolution in general inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to 'upgrade' the lower classes only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it an extremely fine and talented piece wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form symbolically enough the movie itself marked the end of the soviet movie traditions era before the hollywood tsunami had knocked them over Â for good it seems judging by most current russian movies most of them labeled 'blockbusters' in prerelease trailers and posters br br funnily that 'govno' episode is in no contradiction to efenstor's comment above re rude language of current generation from what i've already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this but it was not a mild word by current standards it was way too rude back then and just rude enough to show the true nature of all sharikovs btw re efenstor's lament it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon especially for russian speakers where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation but i join in regret that all the meaning in today's teenager's talk may be expressed by cusswords i feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that's most efficient for the task well this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it
<START> a childless couple brooke adams jeff hayenga go to a doctor james karen to try to conceive it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby br br pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end i saw every twist coming the direction is poor he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene the production values are to be nice lousy very shabby and the gore scenes are too unpleasant i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach with lousy special effects the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film br br some good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown it's easy to see why i give it a 4
<START> this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic br br i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read and colorful characters br br one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is unlike so many sci fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open endings and such this was a pure fairy tale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel br br original fun feel good fantasy
