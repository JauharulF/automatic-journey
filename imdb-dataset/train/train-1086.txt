<START> very dull obvious tedious exorcist rip off featuring a doberman with red eyes that's the extent of the special effects in this made for tv cheapie richard crenna is about as animate as a chew toy very 70's dress music only add to the torture should put you to sleep almost as fast as the corpse vanishes or the blue hand practically worthless moocow says eaghhh what a stinky dog 8p
<START> disowned by richard c sarafian this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am 6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it but i'm afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one the actors mostly recent graduates of overacting 101 deliver one cornball line after another the plot is convoluted the special effects are unimpressive the parts that aren't laughable are just plain boring the script or the book must have been good why else would palance matheson boyle or heston agree to appear in this dud but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen summary avoid not even bad enough to be so bad it's good
<START> why why did they make this movie if timothy olyphant wasn't shirtless in it several times there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie ever um plot nope well defined characters nope the only time i laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she bang p s andy dick nope
<START> the godfather citizen kane star wars goodfellas none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season 1 and not want to continue with the series each season is completely brilliant in its own way dvds are essential to anybody's collection of out 4
<START> everything about this film is hog wash pitiful acting awful dialog ugly native girls this movie sinks into oblivion the director must have been a weekend bender robert c is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on the college kids are worst no acting talent at all very stupid reasoning and just down right dumbbells special effects are for the birds the so called security force around this park belongs in toy land with stupid looking guns walkie talkies that are useless and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper if the park is under construction and nothing works why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew the whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing what a gem convicts should have to watch this so they can commit suicide
<START> got into this flick just as it was beginning on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu otherwise i'd have missed it that probably would have been best br br i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas both very good performers and thought this might be worth a look it proved to be to some extent but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates br br zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents except for her jayne mansfield or loni anderson like bosom unfortunately her acting prowess at least here makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison br br the young nut case's white rat the owner's cat the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home and a bunch of doophus's including the young nut case running around a bio hazard facility and the absurd conclusion i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism believability or being capable of evoking some empathy sympathy but this proved to be in vain
<START> my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong in fact we gave up on it after 45 minutes the idea that crawford young and tone are british but speak with american accents was for me impossible to get past hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone and to echo a previous comment the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous there is no reason to care about any of the characters which is why we threw in the towel halfway through i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian rat a tat delivery so save your time and skip this one
<START> this is a very difficult movie and it's almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on at first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy trelkovsky who needs an apartment and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant a woman commits suicide then the twists and turns start are the neighbors trying to kill him and why are the dead tenant's clothes turning up in the apartment one wonders finally if trelkovksy is the prior tenant br br spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler br br one of the tricks polanski pulls on us is to lie to us we assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality we assume when the camera is showing us things from its omniscient point of view that we see actuality but polanski has the camera lie to us
<START> this film to me is a very good film br br i have a german shepherd myself and i wish to god he was like jerry lee i hope too that there is another k 9 in the running with jerry lee and dooley in them i don't care what any one say these two films were excellent
<START> a lot of talk has been made about psychological westerns but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre it has big name stars who perform very well but it is the director who makes this such a good movie stewart granger loses his british safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the west as one of the best robert taylor plays the upstart in contrast to the usual young upstart taylor's character is middle aged too who wants to slaughter buffalo and lures granger into business with him they hire two other big name actors lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn into being their skinners granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct knowing if they become extinct the native american way of life will greatly suffer taylor soon reveals a sadistic side but it is a realistic saidism unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film created by nerds and dorks he is insecure and needs human companionship still he won't stop at murder the end pits the two against each other with a startling conclusion the psychological effects of what they're doing are well depicted
<START> russ and valerie are having discussions about starting a family the couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles at the same time a dedicated adoption agency owner takes a mini vacation and leaves the orphanage in the charge of his father leslie nielsen father harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea to rent some of the children of the orphanage to couples like russ and valerie harry who becomes aware of the couple'e dilemma offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period brandon kyle and molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents with amusing consequences as the new caretakers are inexperienced with kids but where is the possibility of a happy ending this is a darling family film the actors including nielsen as the wheeler dealer and christopher lloyd as the kind apartment doorman are all wonderful the script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high yes if only life could be this way orphaned children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they are lovable and can give so much joy to the parents who are considering adoption if you want to show a film to your family that is rooted in good values but is also highly entertaining find this movie it is guaranteed to have everyone laughing even as their hearts are melting
<START> terry gilliam traveled again to the future he had already done it in brazil to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race br br the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he's got imagination the futuristic scenes are just great as for the cast bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe whatever happened to her are just ok but brad pitt is so annoying whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all he should just play good looking successful young men br br my rate 7 10
<START> about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night i was 6 years old it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to don't look now in 1987 i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out i'd watched it br br would i have minded if my parents knew i'd watched les valseuses when i was a kid i'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife i don't know if they'd want to see it anyway from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes i'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself br br it's definitely violent it has a violent view of sex virtually no acknowledgement of love even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation but the scenario is very erotic and god i'm so british arousing do they suck her breasts for her own good that is exploitation so why am i getting a woody br br the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman find an ex con mother figure i don't know it ends in a truly gruesome suicide i described it to my friend jb nelson who has cannibal holocaust guts and he went eeuurrgghh no motherly love for this movie quite the opposite mutilation of where the boys began why do they shoot the girl in the leg why does she come back to them do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men br br i'm thinking of two movies one of which i wish i'd never seen the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world swept away madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation once upon a time in america leone god why does noodles do it destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life so close to finally finding love with deborah now they are both destroyed why sergio why br br there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance of both sexes very honest no titillation no fantasy shags no perfect hollywood smooth moves jokes yes but there's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos she'll come back you'll hook her up with your ex con lover's vengeant son she'll learn how to cum from him br br two things i can't stand are rape movies and prison movies les valseuses isn't a rape movie god nobody's going to want to watch it now it is a brilliant movie
<START> this is a low budget roger corman horror creature flick a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping none of the characters have any depth but then they are not the focal point we only get a few glimpses of the huge two legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget film br br my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet with no real stand out roles jane longendecker bruce weitz and charles napier most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr p dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles
<START> since this picture is classified a pure entertainment work and since there are already many comments on it i'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job he has always been acting as a little man an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary however far away from what i expected i saw an image very disguising pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty year old criminal and with a ridiculous happy ending so what is the point many elements are mixed up some principal ones are violence sex and criminal activities amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent lack common sense where is vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no 1 cullinan but the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points and they call it humour a diamond is precious hard and fragile it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris
<START> this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days it's quite effective br br fire and ice in it's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore it's esthetic quality i for sure did not mind bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in cool world and i don't think he has to apoligize since it's pretty much animation for adults but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it br br this one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly bakshi's finest for those who like animations with lushious women try space adventure cobra as well br br i give fire and ice 8 out of 10
<START> to start with i have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah some things happen but you don't know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers illegitimate sons the characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones don't help that much to make'em look credible only marisa paredes stands out but she's a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbish br br the only positive things to say about frÃ­o sol de invierno is that dÃ©butant pablo malo seems to have good intentions and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well maybe the next time br br my rate 4 10
<START> dakota 1988 was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle this film is similar to the later released film harley there are a few differences but they're both the same i don't know which one came first i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life but they both are troubled kids who are trying to turn there lives around instead of bikes this one involves horses they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell if you're a serious l d p fan then i recommend that you watch them both you get some extreme mugging and posturing from l d p if you're game then go for it br br not recommended except for l d p fans
<START> i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory right br br very i liked watching this film when i was the child i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit i very like reading for the subject american and soviet space programs i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows
<START> ivan valeri nikolayev is a bitter cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained he travels to this small town where it's said that a witch ita ever is terrorizing the community br br his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful mysterious girl suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her and the town is wondering who murdered this woman who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure ivan is now being pursued by her spirit or something and he has to have faith or something to beat it br br i really hate christian films they are usually filled with lame actors stupid storyline and minimal effects not to mention that this isn't just a christian film but a foreign one as well the voice over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing because it is so high pitched and whiny you won't miss much by missing out on this film
