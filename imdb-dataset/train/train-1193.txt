<START> well i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values it's a b movie action flick by the director of commando that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b movie with enough entertainment value in it br br it's an '90's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an '80's action movie when these type of b movies were at an all time high these movies always went over the top and never paid much attention to its story or acting it was all about blowing stuff up big muscle heroes and bullets flying around this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies hard to say why really since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era br br it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it the fighting dolph lundgren running around shirtless the characters the story it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot line of the overall movie its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences gun fights and such and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really from the man who brought us commando br br it's foremost a dolph lundgren in which he gets to play the big action hero star who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl played by tia carrere this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together br br none of the characters work out really the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest or to inform anyone about their discoveries not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l a and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling and also just think about it for a moment what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well br br too silly lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough br br 4 10
<START> i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws br br i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws
<START> whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesn't stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money br br whatever it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears br br it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand you're way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare
<START> on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance yikes that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members' stories become secondary it's like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn't happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal
<START> and that's a bad thing because at least if this had been a troma film it would have had wanton violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit br br so what we have instead is a very tame rated pg barely lukewarm low budget roger corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown gremlins 1984 critters 1986 wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor little of the logic that made gremlins work so well fantasy logic or not no suspense no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it br br although i'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script let's face it no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director bettina hirsch in more capable hands munchies could have been entertaining br br after all it starts out like many great adventure films simon waterman harvey korman and his son paul charles stratton are in peru on an archaeological dig simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations for example he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on ancient stonework so they're at machu picchu looking for more evidence of simon's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber inside they quickly find the animal they later dub arnold one of the titular munchies br br they take arnold back home to their small california desert town simon who thinks that arnold is probably an alien creature has to go off to a colleague's lecture and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen paul and his extremely cute girlfriend cindy nadine van der velde are left in charge of arnold but as they haven't seen each other in a long time they leave arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack br br meanwhile simon's brother cecil played also by korman in a dual role owner of a successful snack foods company is eager to buy off simon's home and land they're adjacent to his own simon doesn't want to sell so cecil hits upon a scheme to steal arnold things gradually spiral out of control and the munchies who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food begin to overrun the town br br that reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen the best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town interiors with the exception of cecil's home tend to look like poorly decorated cheap sets and more importantly they tend to show that hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots oddly given the paucity of the production design overall cecil's home is quite a gem imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details and cecil's stepson dude jon stafford was an amusing counterpoint too bad then that he's out of the film so quickly br br at any rate korman is a fun actor but he comes across much better here as simon than as cecil unfortunately simon ends up being absent for most of the film cecil who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair is not only the evil capitalist of the film he's one of korman's classic inconsiderate boorish characters that was one of his specialties frequently capitalized on in carol burnett show 1967 skits unlike the carol burnett show which tended to succeed because directors clark jones and dave powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos hirsch reins korman in way too far and the cecil character just doesn't work the way it should br br there are a lot of other director related problems not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film even scenes that should have been shoe ins for amping up the drama such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect br br there are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands where did the munchie in the chamber at machu picchu come from the film's trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut a more serious problem is that unlike gremlins there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute cuddly furballs to menacing monsters it just happens further because munchies was kept pg and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase they're never very threatening they're also easily dispatched at least temporarily br br admittedly the gist of the film isn't suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor it's intended more as a spoof of gremlins and the countless rip offs in its wake the only problem with that is that the film just isn't funny even though i chuckled a couple times a surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clichÃ©s too much of the remaining material consists of non sequiturs given bad timing from hirsch it all just falls flat there was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala killer klowns from outer space 1988 too bad then that munchies comes nowhere near that
<START> time travel is a fun concept and this film gives it a different slant i got a kick out of captain billingham one of the more down to earth characters who was just not having a good day ordinarily i don't choose to watch horror films but this is an exception good story excellent acting
<START> this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one br br it's unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it
<START> lipstick is another glossy movie failure i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie and i am having trouble coming up with something i guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered but it could have been a lot better lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view the sets were very glossy and nice to look at the cast was okay i felt like anne bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one
<START> this western is done in a different manner than most others realism is the key here conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape but it's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west cinematography is excellent solid 9 torn farrell excel in this movie
<START> emma is my favourite jane austen novel emma is well meaning despite her flaws so readers can forgive and love her and the relationship she has with mr knightley which is warm familiar respectful but playful generating that warm fuzzy romantic excitement mr knightley is the perfect man and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent clever confident woman remember she is only 21 and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws who doesn't want to be emma who doesn't want to be told off by mr knightley this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma i couldn't even finish watching it i just found it so awful i couldn't see that warm generous side of emma which drives the reader to love her the patience and warmth she shows to her father the closeness between her and mrs weston which demonstrates her willingness to put her friend's happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding miss taylors marriage mr woodhouse's character in this adaptation just appears bizarre rather than just quaint elderly and a bit trying br br this adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection mr knightley is indulgent of emma's minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray and emma looks up to him though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i've described above mr knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers br br really horrible i can't understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off
<START> i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant br br at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy br br so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish br br i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film br br none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all br br the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks they looked awful and aragorn and sam face br br i don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better br br i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film br br 3 10
<START> billed as takashi miike's first family film by people who haven't seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family friendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different he's really never been a one trick pony but often gets accused of it perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless it's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into br br there's a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects aren't going to be seamless hollywood style work some blue screening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stop motion and puppetry i think the little sock puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job it's so hard to find a pre teen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie eared river princess yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in yokai but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit there's plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got
<START> as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then there's the core premise of the hero heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but it's really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really
<START> the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe br br the tasteless below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here that fault surely lies with director hackerling who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around br br the cast does what they can chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated all depictions of europeans are one dimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the english are sooo polite br br apart from a few scenes there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick but if you're a chevy chase fan like myself the film is watchable but no more than that
<START> i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me people talk about this as a movie for kids but i think it's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging infirm parents our own mortality our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us br br the movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life br br quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful layered performance the camera work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together they left out anything that wasn't necessary very nice
<START> this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel
<START> i love this tv series so much it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful i cant believe that they cut it off tv and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not apparently they survive but i'm not sure cybersix was by far the best tv show ever i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it i luved it so much 3 br br its about a women by the name of cybersix she is not human she goes by adrian sieldman a man teacher at a highschool now cybersix is actually a women she is just disguised as a man in the day by night cybersix patrols the city br br a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her br br if u have never watched it before u should totally download it it was the best tv show in the world why did they cut it off some people have issues but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes
<START> what a fun filled sexy movie they certainly don't make them like this anymore 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures the tone is oddly innocent as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant richard o' sullivan literally gets 'randi' sic the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school my special interest in 'au pair girls' is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake if any actress has ever looked better naked she's slim but wonderfully curvy or clothed come to that i've loved her since the original run of ufo who else could carry off a purple wig i'll eat my hat
<START> i love horror movies i can even appreciate most cheese face it 9 out of 10 horror films these days are cheese but this was just ridiculous terrible acting terrible writing completely hollow and unbelievable characters no meisner actors here and a total lack of sufficient body count i wish i could salvage the 79 minutes of my life i just wasted at least the crook brothers are aptly named the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia silverstone wanna be get punched in the face how this ever made it to sundance is completely baffling to me most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even by slasher film standards i mean come on who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep lame
<START> this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible but this is inconsequential as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized screenplays not always need be 'chatty' but they should at least assist the development of the story here one line attempts such as he just took off or i know you don't have love in heart just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music talk about trying to hard if you are interested in a good film the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you
