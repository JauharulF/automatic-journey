<START> i'm a pretty old dude old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50 55 years ago when every taste for a kid was fresh i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker so that i could taste those things today this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i've drifted physically and otherwise a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations over the half century they would have had to adjust quite a bit because you see i would have known that i set them aside eating one now would be a celebration of self and past and story and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward br br i didn't have enough sense to do that with original coke and i couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers Â not then but i did something almost as good in the seventies i really tuned into roman polanski he was a strange and exotic pleasure Â you know movies smuggled out of the soviet block movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward movies that make you want to live with polish women one and then deciding that they would be the last to get it br br here's what i did i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside i did not watch it i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it over the years i would test myself my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it there probably are few poles who have worked at this practicing to deserve chopin working to deserve womanness when i see it trying to get the inners from the edges br br recently i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally because i had already seen and understood 9th gate br br if you do not know this it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant about whom the story is named jumped out the window to die later after this man played by polanski visits what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad but the way we follow him he is not he merely has flashes that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality br br the story hardly matters what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh the two never meet there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all Â at all except a redhead wig br br i know of no one else that could do this this sketch that remains a sketch this horror that remains natural br br to understand the genius of this you have to know one of the greatest films ever made rear window the genius of that film is the post noir notion that the camera shapes the world that the viewer creates the story what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out in rear window the idea was that the on screen viewer jimmy stewart was the anchor and everything else was fiction woven as we watched here the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker we know this we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator we know it is true that bodies shift identity that times shift that causality is plastic we know that the narrator will kill us we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine br br ted's evaluation 4 of 3 every cineliterate person should experience this
<START> when the us entered world war i the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford br br pickford plays a young woman torn between two men jack holt german and raymond hatton french but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist br br when the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans think lusitania because it is carrying munitions pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander later on of course she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a chÃ¢teau br br director cecil b demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed out village they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing against the wall is a very large crucifix as they stand and watch the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains suspended in mid air it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un artsy br br pickford is as always a pleasure to watch she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm waving histrionics many other actors of the day used she's also very very pretty holt is very good here in a leading man role hatton is ok among the list of name actors in extra parts are wallace beery ramon novarro colleen moore ben alexander hobart bosworth norman kerry walter long james neill and edythe chapman br br not a great film but interesting to see us propaganda at work
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's i'll take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work shelly has acted in two of hartley's films not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies i'll see you there is a great indie film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion br br the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat all washed up bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy played by the director adrienne shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a self help book and a date for her traumatized brother br br the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her however her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy br br aware that bill desperately wants to see rose bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun a pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stops along the way
<START> an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no place because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes what and the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk 4 miles across the dead black fields umm yeah sure or they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality and stay at the 'haunted' train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or plot br br so very terribly dull that this seems impossible br br this ought to be added to the lost films list aargh
<START> i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i don't mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasn't too bad but wasn't good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some half ass cgi rip off only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is much better
<START> any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the clinton era br br it's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman
<START> i rated this film 7 10 which is an average of 8 10 for screenplay direction and 1944 production values and 6 10 for acting my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4 10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol richman who was excellent at 8 10 also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson alan curtis was just in view of his naive alibi these two then form an alliance to prove scott's alibi br br i have this film on a suevia film noir cine negro dvd in spanish as la dama desconocida with the original soundtrack ingles as an alternative language since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in impact playing a sole female garage proprietor here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in kansas her boss's pet name for her before solving the missing alibi the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her he had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so i suppose family man had lit up in carol's brain br br in the 1940s with the film code in operation producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by elisha cooke jnr carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about the phantom lady alibi the other main character jack marlow an associate of scott henderson is played by franchot tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol for instance did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience
<START> the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and no one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards br br made the same year as philadelphia the tom hanks oscar winner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all true br br in order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60's and 70's and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see br br oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease but the government wasn't ready for that so when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples the names project the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed this close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didn't suddenly become ill too nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation to the point that as i write this there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people both straight and gay had to die before our common humanity became more obvious but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain
<START> granted i had seen some speed racer but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it it actually ended the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america the villains not only consisted of dr hell but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion
<START> cheap and mind blisteringly dull story and acting not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable the 'homoerotic' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers i'm not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
<START> here's a review for people like me this movie sucks from beginning to end i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000 the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned and she's rich and she's a famous psychologist come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half witted movie viewers rain man would have been insulted i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat eaters war starters and fur wearers my hatred is so complete that it defies logic but i'll give it a shot that it's not supposed to sound real is fine i don't care it's that everyone talks the same mamet can't create characters all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors no wonder his actors are so wooden they're confused about everyone being the same character however his later films do improve
<START> to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all the murderer is popular delaware attorney tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor's scheduling secretary anne marie fahey their relationship was a well kept secret until her disappearance and murder she wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily on the other hand he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life besides the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series while the actress who plays ms fahey does a fine job she does not have her dark long hair his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations with ann rule's executive producing she adds accuracy to anne marie's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director if you have not read the book it is well worth it ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano he also played ann rule's former friend and subject ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago he was brilliant then and now he does an above average job with an amazing story even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case and now the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election if you don't think the movie is interesting then the read rule's book
<START> the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27 year old former class mates br br i like the idea of the show that's why it saddens me that the class is not funny even though it has the obvious potential it's not enough corky just dorky haha this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines also some actors have difficulties with timing br br most inventively written characters are the twins kat and lina warbler lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used to be couple duncan and nicole br br what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent even though by a non respectable character but anyway
<START> this 1991 nbc tv movie aired six months before john goodman's big screen version of the life of babe ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production isn't perfect but it presents the babe's story with more depth and complexity than goodman's one dimensional telling i especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins who always understood his star player's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruth's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tv movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking br br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with ruth's arrival in new york in 1920 one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his eight men out role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis
<START> i usually enjoy loretta young's early movies her acting back then was light and breezy and she sure knew how to wear clothes but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer husband paul lukas into becoming a championship bridge player it's not the most cinematic of games and the long talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film br br there's one interesting bit though as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game a series of quick shots show airplanes trains football games even a diver in mid air freezing in anticipation of the event it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film wish the rest of it were that inventive and funny
<START> this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it's the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent he is a good character actor but that's about it klaus is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy
<START> it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and editing which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films br br the film doesn't deliver on the on screen deaths there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck but all other deaths are hardly interesting but the lack of on screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film just a bad one br br the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements done in a tongue in cheek way for example after a kill charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less this is something that can only get a laugh br br if you're into slasher films definitely give this film a watch it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers but not by much the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious you may forget the movie you may remember it i'll remember it because i love the name
<START> loved it what's not to like you got your suburbia you got your zombies you got your family issues you got your social dilemmas you got yourself one fine retro 1950's style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust you couldn't ask for more br br cast is superb carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife she's both wanton and criminally conspiratorial every fellow's dream k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence and somehow succeeding he's a genuine screen presence very photogenic and natural without naming them all the rest of the cast is wonderful henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona billy connolly is delightful as fido a fine actor i wish that he had played the title role in braveheart with gibson directing my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character his fido is contained yet accessible a nice touch br br in short a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals values social pinnings feelings growth coping in uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions a true reality show
<START> i attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations br br 1 just because you've directed a ton of music videos does not make you qualified to make movies the movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense horrible angles and terrible lighting the editing didn't help this mess at all when dixie shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about br br 2 the plot had promise but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes we never get to understand what drives the characters what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichÃ©s in fact the whole town was one big clichÃ© of southern life half the audience groaned when toby drawled ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl and we were treated to that insipid line not once but twice the revelations were yawn inducing and the dramatic confessions boiled down to i was stupid and stubborn br br 3 the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with toby was dark and brooding most of the film but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming it's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that kelly preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows lindsay haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her burt reynolds and tess harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost and indeed their characters get lost in this film br br 4 if you're a toby fan you'll love the songs but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs or the artists on his record label for instance the movie's official love song is crash here tonight you'd think that would play around a tender love scene but nope we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service it was as if they said well we gotta use this song somewhere the song broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie br br in summary a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for toby keith's music and product placement for ford trucks it goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video i like toby and really wanted to like broken bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where
