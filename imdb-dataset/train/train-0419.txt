<START> the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933 a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible go ahead take a look at the film you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 it was the first true special effects movie come 2000 computer aided special effects seem like child's play audiences are not blown away by special effects instead they are disappointed if they are not done right the special effects in hollow man the update of the hg wells story are ok but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven who you might remember from showgirls and total recall kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientist dabbling in the world of bio invisibilation yeah i know that's not a word but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding so as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation yeah i know i used that non word again process the process has dire consequences no caine does not die but instead becomes a horny violent creature aka a guy now that he's invisible caine stalks a sexy neighbor a co worker former girlfriend linda elisabeth shue and the man who took away his funding then a funny thing happens caine becomes a new supernatural being the thing that won't die laughing in the face of all things natural caine faces down death and spits in it's face as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die dragging the ending of the movie out the movie is silly stupid and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used sometimes not there are neat possibilities in hollow man but of course not one of them is explored for a more interesting look at an invisible being get ready for some good old fashioned black and white cinema and check out the 1933 invisible man kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano
<START> the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission he plays a kind of james bond's psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt as an intense hit man his character is very sexual but even better very funny add the kind hearted uber likable american guy next door' greg kinnear to set up contrast the myriad locations vivid colors and quick witted humor provide great entertainment hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife but the focus of the film is on the two fellows a new odd couple and that's the part that works very well have a great probably r rated laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper
<START> last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show you're not watching br br well they're right that you're not watching it it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147 br br translation this is the lowest rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore it's as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceled br br the only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
<START> in christian duguay's movie hitler the rise of evil hitler's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie making it more interesting we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary who cares how did his dog died anyway br br throughout the movie hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals but he was not portrayed as a super villain but more like an ambitious politician i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective yes he was a little mad and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in inglorious bastards i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts br br the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators even though the movie's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him br br another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews in the beginning of the movie some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews br br in conclusion hitler the rise of evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all if you can stand directors that change history for cash it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler's personality in a successful way
<START> airwolf the movie a variation on the original 2 part pilot yet the movie although shorter does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same 2 parter combined but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there br br worth a look even if you have the season 1 dvd set i'd still pick up a copy of the movie it's still in some shops like virgin woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores although it generally needs ordering but it saves needing to buy online as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping but if you look around airwolfs in stores br br airwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows br br a full size airwolf is currently being re built for a helicopter museum info and work in progress pictures are over at http airwolf org also with airwolf mods for flashpoint and flight sim games it seams she's finally here to stay
<START> this film is basically two hours of dafoe's character drinking himself nearly literally to death the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of time br br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter stormare is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing br br i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one it's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result
<START> skippy from family ties plays eddie a wussy 'metal' nerd who gets picked on when his favorite wussy 'metal' singer sammi curr dies he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge but then he doesn't want to take it as far as sammi does which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say rock star ok maybe a tad more than that piece of junk but you get my point and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from family ties i haven't a clue the cameo by gene simmons is ok and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency i applaud him for that but otherwise skip this one br br my grade d br br eye candy elise richards gets topless an a topless extra at a pool party
<START> dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor to much calm down get yourself together and make us laugh i didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars just because there both up on stage or something he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star i'm sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru i also liked the reese's pieces joke if dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating as high as maybe an eight
<START> on the surface written on the wind is a lurid glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a texas oil family but underneath it all is a deep social commentary on 1950's life director douglas sirk scores again with another univeral sudser robert stack falls in love with lauren bacall the problem is that stack's best pal rock hudson loves her too when stack finds out he's sterile and bacall ends up pregnant the fireworks fly and the all too good dorothy malone won an oscar for her portrayl of texas' biggest nympho who is shunned by hudson good epic soap opera
<START> this movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else i've ever seen really if you are a tolkien fan rent it just to laugh at it with your friends i won't be the millionth person to rip apart its flaws all i will say is that the movie for me anyway lost major points for turning my favorite character sam into a bumbling idiot shame shame 3 10
<START> adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different mediums do you think it's a great idea to make zulu into a stage play imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping blimey there's thousands of them out there great movie and a bad stage play br br in order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two essentials needed br br 1 a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry br br 2 great dialogue br br on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles the story revolves around a hit man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny since the story is very static it's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch 12 angry men instead
<START> swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate american hardened action movies like heat but with a low budget this movie follows the same prescription as noll tolerans and livvakterna however it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie br br the story has been seen before the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor especially from the main actress the movie tries to paint a picture of hard boiled military like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational it does not succeed very well br br the bluish cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore and it is not even done well in this picture only a very few scenes actually look good also the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward br br the main quality of this movie is stefan sauk though not making a convincing portrait of a swat team leader has some really funny lines also the music is quite well
<START> it is very hard to rate this film as entertainment value for 21st century viewers it fails miserably however for the student of early sound films and history it is a jewel show of shows was a revue filmed to compete with mgm's successful hollywood revue of 1929 which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes br br the purpose of the all star revue was to showcase a particular studio's silent stars in speaking roles and show that they could make the transition however warner bros seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn't even have under long term contract such as ben turpin lloyd hamilton beatrice lillie and even a marching band meanwhile their biggest talent al jolson is noticeably absent even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity the finale is also overly long but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers br br the highlights of the film are two numbers from winnie lightner pingo pongo and singin in the bathtub a couple of numbers with nick lucas john barrymore performing shakespeare and the chinese fantasy li po li with nick lucas and myrna loy this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor and it really is quite attractive reasonably enough the players in these good acts were long term warner bros stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them br br this film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history the year 1929 which was the bridge year between two eras the silent and sound eras and the roaring 20's and the great depression just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast as warner bros would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros its distinctive urban look and feel james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson and others
<START> a clever script from the late sebastian japrisot and smart performances from the two male leads alain delon and charles bronson or should it be the other way around result in an engaging and entertaining thriller br br add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by francois de roubaix it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality br br this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners both disillusioned and world weary returning presumably from algiers like the other colonial powers of this time post ww ii leading into the 60s france had struggled to keep up appearances overseas losing algiers was a bitter blow br br adieu l'ami the original title chronicles the actions of our two anti heroes as they struggle to make a go of it after their discharge br br one thing happens after another and the viewer really has to pay attention because japrisot is lean and economical with his script if it is there then there must be a reason br br suffice to say these two men battle it out physically and psychologically one long weekend their motivation is quite different their goals are different their survival depends entirely on each other that alain delon and charles bronson are outwardly so different the former arguably a pretty boy and the latter an ugly thug adds to the chemistry br br that quest makes for a great story which in turn makes for a great film br br lest i forget there are women in this film and true to the japrisot method they too are memorable though not nearly as fleshed out to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature br br farewell friend has been released in the uk an anamorphic image 16 9 enhanced in english only not even subtitles for the hard of hearing a running time of 110 minutes mono soundtrack but the de roubaix music has lots of punch br br highly recommended
<START> in this satire of the commercialization and 'lightheartedness' of war john cusack plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to 'turaqistan' to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the us's own company in addition to this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomei br br assessing the technical aspects br br the acting by the main characters at least was good as was to be expected some of john cusack's dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while i've never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be pop star unfortunately they went 0 for 3 with her br br like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusack's dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors br br joshua seftel who previously had a drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather wide spectrum film he handled the small 10 million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be much more seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hard to watch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc br br as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the 'golden palace poker' ads on the u s tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what it's going for an a young 'mel brooks' type of style br br overall the film is very well made for the meager budget and it's definitely worthy of a look it won't go down as one of the great satires of cinema but it's certainly not the worst br br 7 10
<START> this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic there was only one reason for this movie john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff bo derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex this movie is nothing more than soft porn if you're into that well then fast forward to it and skip the rest this movie like bolero was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie richard harris was a better actor than this this was one of his few mistakes don't waste your time on this movie go buy the book instead
<START> a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end
<START> the life and time of little richard as told by little richard as produced and directed by little richard was about as one sided as one of his songs this is not a biography or even a docudrama but does have good writing great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard all the music is by little richard so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song br br the movie covers his early childhood carrys thru the formative years in music the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lord its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles whom opened for him br br my main objection is that his outrageous counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time some of his energy which he still has does not come across full force he seemed tame compared to what i remember of him at the time br br the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing to make the point about not having a decent place to change br br if they had gotten into the bronze liberace as richard use to refer to himself in interviews then there's a story trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience his headband nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t v appearance you can find little richard is always on
<START> as i said the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in every time she opened her mouth i cringed it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie brad johnson was good as the other lead br br i really liked the beach location scenes they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though it looked like the night scenes were actually sf but i could be wrong i don't recall the character in the book being this depressing br br please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent
<START> a most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and moreau and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoiler br br get your expectations straight it's an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommended br br dialogues are used sparingly but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking fragments spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages
