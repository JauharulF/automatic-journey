<START> as said before the visual effects are stunning they're breathtaking i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all but that's all this movie is not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear for example in the first scene proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what the conflict seems to be between man and nature here later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit proog explains that one step out of place and you're dead here there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature as the movie progresses it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature but suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when proog out of nowhere murders emo proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man he betrays us not only is this depressing but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed it's not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger it's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does in my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects however the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy there's no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending in conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point but the graphics are good
<START> a lot of people hated this movie but that i blame on two facts 1 they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and 2 they are trying to take it too seriously br br this one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love dwight the plot is predictable i'll say that but then what teen comedy isn't road trip dirty deeds etc etc they are all incredibly predictable but still goddamn funny i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike br br after watching naked mile and this one it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about and only about the stiflers which is fine by me br br watch enjoy love xd
<START> i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen's greatest fans he does however feature as an important poet musician in my literary musical heritage by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard's reflections on his own life and career warming and humble br br unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of leonard's musical literary manner nick cave jarvis cocker beth orton were the exceptions even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs br br what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him a lot is said in this respect but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge they view leonard as a special icon but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen the collaboration with u2 is a farce the entire live registration looks like a rushed job and just as in the whole film only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part br br the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project the use of effects such as echo slow motion or flashed images are ill placed some of the camera work is dismal part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd br br some unintentional humor at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre initially he can't recall the genre's name until eventually he says it was punk the punksters really picked up on his music the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't forget' br br and i can't forget i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who
<START> if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
<START> br br a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find and i have a good laugh watching them with him br br i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking br br he knows i am serious br br
<START> i'm grateful for one thing and one thing only that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent yay this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'brand f cking beckham' br br a few years ago i used to really like 'posh and becks' i still very much admire david's talent but i have no respect for him anymore how can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet br br it was clear the hand of victoria was all over beckham's premature departure from manchester united and now the same thing has happened at real madrid i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds he's sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england no offence america but at baseball and basketball you rule football you don't br br anyway i digress it's been years since i've seen such an over the top entirely false performance from 'posh' this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca loos 'debacle' when instead of throwing all the cr p at david he deserved she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money spinner her marriage has become br br this whole pr stunt was pathetic why can't she just go over there quietly support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be shrouded by this huge fan fare br br incidentally i saw the david beckham documentary last night at least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility two things his wife could do with learning br br one more thing victoria you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps little hint stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman br br good luck america
<START> as other reviewers have noted this is an unjustly neglected depression era film directed by frank borzage two oscars and written by jo swerling leave her to heaven the westerner lifeboat etc it is a tough minded well structured and realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown they're grifters beggars and women forced into prostitution but they're a community of people both good and bad with loyalties as complex as any group's br br perhaps primary among this movie's many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy's character bill and loretta young's trina he tough talking physically aggressive and evidently fearless but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival while he blusters trina actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or i'll even give up the kid if you'll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta young's performance at age 20 as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or dependent but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more
<START> this movie earned every one of the ten votes i gave it thank you guys for making a movie worth watching you showed the world you can still write direct produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes the poetry was awesome as well hats off to the poets and musicians br br i watched it last night as i fell in love with my darling all over again i will be adding it to my movie collection today and recommending it to my friends and family br br please continue to produce quality don't worry about the quantity br br thank you again and best wishes and blesses to you
<START> this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater 3000 don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film
<START> lost probably the best t v series ever made the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode 100 more are raised if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting and heres your answer every season so far has always been full of surprises your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far the series just sucks you in it's chilling and very addictive everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story lost is simply unbelievable amazing highly entertaining top notch t v at it's best how ever you want to put it br br lost beat's all other show's by a landslide and if your hating or criticising lost you don't know how to watch t v or watch drama lost simply doesn't disappoint you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better but it does it just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off every thing happens for a reason and that is truly shown in the series eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on br br the 10 minutes of excitement you see something you didn't see coming something major has happened to character or on the island there's hope somewhere you see a major twist that can or will change everything you hear your thought's churn you wonder what's gonna happen next your heart beating the 30 minutes of brilliance you see a flawless scenes tension building you hear wonderful music by michael giacchino you see great flash backs impressive acting you see wittiness chilling atmosphere which then get's converted back into tension br br everyone has there show that they are addicted too that they can't get enough of that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode that they talk about 24 7 too me and many others it's this series lost once you start watching you won't get enough the creators did a flawless job lost is completely unique and original you won't see anything like it the clever idea of flashbacks and flashforwards and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts would they ever make a series like lost something so interesting and something you will always remember it simply has stunned the world when it hit t v a new generation of dramatic sci fi a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers br br i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it so what's stopping you from watching br br every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better you get more interested as it goes along you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off the characters start to become very likable and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island all together it's a great drama and a flawless series i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far so if you don't watch lost read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind seeing is believing so until you start watching you will never know i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series lost start watching you have not seen nothing until you watch lost
<START> well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti christ however the movie was just poorly written for example they never explained how they made the dentist incident an accident or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all the kid they chose to play the anti christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid just don't waste your time watching this
<START> this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view sometimes it worked other times it did not tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war acting was okay script was okay overall it was a mediocre film
<START> this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen and that's saying a lot considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise lovers' lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stone faced monotone actor i've ever seen the best worst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking who's the killer a disgruntled huggies employee i'd have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it
<START> i saw this movie the day it came out last year hilarious i thought well now it's on video and i saw it again i love this movie the things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time the special effects are okay but the witty dialog will have you rolling i'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie so if you like dramas and other stuff avoid but for all others enjoy the acting is superb hank azaria is hands down the best he's neither a commie nor a fruit followed by ben stiller uh don't correct me it sickens me and then william h macy delivering his best performance outshining fargo everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy two problems the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani and the casanova parole hearing some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way but they're a blast kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone but bam they switch and you're ready for more i swear after seeing this you will be tired from the explosive climax which i think was pretty cool the camera is pretty cool also moving at a furious pace with the actors also tom waits delivers an outstanding performance he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him and like someone else said the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them captain amazing is pretty funny especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plan i was rolling and rush is pretty cool as casanova one beef the funniest comedian ever eddie izzard is almost wasted but his heart is in the right place so all in all a wonderful movie i give it twenty stars and hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody the six million dollar man one laughing right now as i think about it 20 10
<START> tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films at two hours it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in 1922 no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's
<START> enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture this wonderful creepy yet mysterious looking english home with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it there are four 4 tales concerning this house and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds but don't let that fool you there is horror all over the place peter cushing black jack '80 gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even christopher lee curse of the crimson altar 68 and his little daughter chloe franks jane reid make a wonderful exciting story together his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books if you love creepy horrible and mysterious films with lots of surprises this is the film for you
<START> zombie nation 2004 r br br hey i was bored i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film i could've used that advice br br zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them yup he's a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison he doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it talk about boring eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh yay br br this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier make up effects the women don't look zombie like unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear it's a waste of time br br 1 10
<START> just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this run down house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a low budget flick director writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and down to earth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
<START> i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't know how i sat through an hour of it i must have been in a coma that night i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago i couldn't even remember the name but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today yech vomit barf
<START> i laughed a lot while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully there's max who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom edward's insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next
