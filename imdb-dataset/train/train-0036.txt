<START> lost holds something interesting for everyone you can say an awfully lot about this series and an awfully lot has been said so i won't be the one to spell it all out for you again just read the persons who loved it and you'll know why you want to watch it the nice thing about this series is that its totally new there are not much movies and even fewer series based on the theme of only suspense but lost lives up to the theme with pride its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location nice plot twists an excellent cast and a good format present and past combined in single episodes you'll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling you want to have all the insights of the characters you want to see the overall picture and you'll want to know where the writers are taking you the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go on a more sceptic note the series went under a bit in season 2 probably due to its own success it is well known that lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed the writers were overwhelmed too in my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season 2 then to solve the ones or partially at least the ones of season 1 at the end of season 2 you ended with a big blurr of secrets plot twists and unexplained phenomena but there is only so much a viewer can take the difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge season 3 handed out a lot of insights to partially replace them with new questions and that's exactly how they should write you want to thumble from one plot twist to the next not get a tsunami of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers they got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4 its good to see that such a different format of a series can be so hugely popular
<START> this movie doesn't even deserve a one this was an utter waste of time it was a waste of film and money it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language but not only that there is no plot line the actors are terrible the accents are horrible the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie br br the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt who got only a fifteen second part by the way i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times adding only a new sentence br br a film similar to this is eraser head possibly the most disturbing movie in existence there is no plot line and is not funny although it isn't trying to be funny do not watch either movie
<START> otherwise it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women non lesbian don't bathe together nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters don't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park men don't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely ridiculous br br heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights and that is because she wasn't acting br br i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
<START> i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but that's it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films br br the story involves nothing but unlikable self centered chain smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public can't stand br br the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing
<START> over the years i've seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege 2 and executive decision at least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications br br on the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter i honestly believe that more of segal's movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results
<START> it was one of those late night it's there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldn't have been br br the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance we're talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didn't compensate for the one missing ingredient a story the plot was ludicrous i don't mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one br br i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
<START> this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i don't know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though it's mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you don't get any good details into their personal lives it's mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britney's music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
<START> why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it also there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie he was uncredited but his list of roles here imdb does give him credit btw rain is his sister for those who have were asking before this film is proof that no matter how many big names you have sow's ears don't make silk purses i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad sad sad maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film it has no endearing entertaining or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else
<START> i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing but i love this show i don't know why but i enjoy watching it i love adam the best the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany and that was only the first two seasons that is disappointing but that's ok i'll keep looking online if anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through 14th seasons please email me at darkangel 1627 yahoo com i already own the first one the only down side is that the dvds being from germany they only play on my portable dvd player and my computer oh well i still own it
<START> wow baby this is indeed some fine asian horror gore and a crazy outlandish movie this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo except in this case with all the blood and guts there is a bizarre love story it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human is they need to kill each other and eat the other hmmm yum yum this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's the thing in creature design and effects i would put this in the must have category for gorehounds as there is non stop carnage and some very fine gore and a must have for stoners because you don't even need to read the sub titles the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour meatball machine is great fun for gorehounds there is no doubt about it and i simply loved it
<START> the humor in who's your daddy is such poor taste that i actually closed my eyes in certain scenes close ups of semen are not funny nobody thinks they are people get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness they laugh watching who's your daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling
<START> yes i'm sentimental schmaltzy but this movie and it's theme song remain one of my all time greats robert downey jr does such justice to the role of louis jeffries reincarnated and the storyline although far fetched is romantic makes one believe in happy endings
<START> this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic as long as there are still people who sing dance and act
<START> people criticise disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy set in landscapes that are much too pristine that criticism is just and yet it can't be the whole story because the two least glossy alice in wonderland and peter pan are also the weakest cinderella on the other hand set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles is clearly the best br br it does look good the backgrounds are subtle and consistent the colours are pure without being too bright the animation varies a bit i'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped but then the rotoscoped humans including cinderella herself aren't full blooded characters in the script so this approach works well enough it's really the animals that make the movie i think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before as totems rather than sidekicks the mice for instance are the creatures who draw us into the story but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless cinderella the cat lucifer is a kind of witch's familiar to the wicked stepmother the cat is brilliantly conceived and animated one of the best feline creations of all time the supervising animator was ward kimball and he modelled it on his own cat i wonder how he put up with the animal this approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story br br among the supporting cast the notable humans are the king and the grand duke the king is a one note character he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion the grand duke is a put upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as cinderella does although he of course is richer br br cinderella is disney's return to features after an eight year hiatus and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years moreover he made things hard for himself by picking cinderella she's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that maybe i'm wrong on this score i haven't seen the recent ever after nonetheless it is remarkable how successful disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life without cutting across the grain of its spirit
<START> the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears yes tears i tell you this popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok indeed latin america is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries though in the case of mexico the election was clearly stolen by calderon chavez is not perfect far from it he's trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely that cannot be tolerated enough with the politics and back to the movie the pace is breath taking at moments and deeply philosophical at others it portrays chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the us hegemony and domination of the world's resources if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez nothing's stopping you from doing your homework one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on chavez's supporters venezuela puts american alleged democracy to shame hasta la revolucion siempre
<START> this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and fairly tame sex scenes the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess it's more expensive looking than most of director al adamson's films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci fi films the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films there are no former big namers or b actors some of the music is ok but it's easy to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years
<START> i'm sorry but i didn't like this doc very much i can think of a million ways it could have been better the people who made it obviously don't have much imagination the interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered the footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either it's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features one thing i'll say is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets all considered this only gets a '4 '
<START> the rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end dennis quaid played the role to perfection the little boy that plays his son was fantastic he made this a father son movie to remember the messages are good ones follow your dreams failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try the excitement is palpable i believe this movie will be a classic
<START> it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
<START> i drove from sacramento to san francisco and back to see this movie premiere and really glad i did as a big movie fan and a life long northern californian i was surprised how many oscar winning films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george lucas' comments about persistence community and having a vision really resonated with me br br hey if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf so can other artists br br would recommend this film
