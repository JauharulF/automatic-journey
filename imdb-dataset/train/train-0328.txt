<START> i bought this movie for 1 euro not knowing what it was all about i thought hmmm a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore it wasn't funny alright it was disturbing very disturbing and i don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing to do hmmm the quality of the images were terrible the acting there was no acting just some fcked up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes this is probably material for sicko's jurking off on extreme gore br br don't watch this it's not worth your time its just awful i wish i never bought this br br they should mutilate the guy who made this
<START> i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night not knowing what to expect i had heard of this movie but never really any opinions on it br br i have to say i was impressed with what i saw i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times br br the blob was scary looking now i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand br br steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews the protagonist of the film i also liked the old man in the beginning br br for a 50's horror movie this was very well done even by today's standards br br 8 10
<START> summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind besides she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century
<START> one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in esoteric please don't watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful faÃ§ade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon andreas marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few euros i'm waiting for the second hit
<START> vincente minelli movies are usually worth your time meet me in st louis the bad and the beautiful i awaited this movie with great interest but what a disappointment br br some came running is scene after scene of go nowhere fatalism sinatra is a sad sack returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships a disappointing floozy hanging on him living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and macclane and something disappointing happens the sequence is intended to be tension filled but minelli is no hitchcock he gets so distracted by pretty colors he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing clichÃ© and the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot especially macclane but that's the only real cinematography in the project otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours hell is other people apparently br br there is nothing going on in this movie the dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after ww2 is handled more deftly in 'the best years of our lives ' and either of two inge products 'splendor in the grass' and 'picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead end town with much more poignance
<START> i didn't enjoy this film i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring a 20year old computer saving the day i thought that this was just slightly far fetched even for a film i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off why not take a sledgehammer to it br br its a shame but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film it wasn't if that is what you want to watch do not watch this film br br even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day this would still in my opinion be a very very cheesy flick
<START> spoilers br br my dad had taped this movie for me when i was 3 by age 5 i had watched it over 400 times i just watched it and watched it and i still do today it has a grim storyline a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf a very emotional scene and wants to become a wolf like him after years of training the lamb is made into a really really evil looking thing he and the wolf travel to his old barn but he cannot kill the lambs no matter how much he wishes to he ends up killing the wolf but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and can't return to his previous way of life br br the art is beautiful the songs are well okay and the voice acting is better than some things today br br all in all you just have to see this movie it is a great masterpiece although it's very hard to find today br br
<START> this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil like demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn't be worse the girl sees what she's done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better
<START> the most amazing spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel far better than any other film or movie made about the restoration thus far if you haven't seen it hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now you won't regret it you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith you finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter days saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense afterward
<START> and i love it lots of special effects and for a movie that's not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece i'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch it's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits br br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong the topic is exotic and original production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is great br br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope they'll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure movies br br just fantastic
<START> okay maybe not all of it lured by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movie's cover but the horror the horror whatever you do do not watch this movie gouge out your eyes repeatedly bash your skull in do what it takes never again never forget br br
<START> this is pretty much a low budget made for tv type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original i'm a fan of b movies and this one might have been good had they not attached the name cube to it because as is the director and plot of the original were better and this movie just about ruined my taste for the entire series the characters are annoying and clichÃ©d there are problems with continuity and several outright production screw ups the story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that they more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and over throughout the movie and because the first one was so good this simply turns out as a disappointment br br if this was a stand alone b movie i'd probably give it about a four the 1 rating i give it was pretty much a statement about how it utterly paled in effects and intelligence as compared to the first
<START> anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie plus it makes fun of the college film genre it's funny it's got a cast to die for amy pohler rachel dratch sophie monk parker posey jane lynch amber tamblyn missi pyle and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud writer actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain wilson phillips omg i'm just repeating myself now it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb
<START> this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy it is an extreme tragedy it left me sick to my stomach i hated it i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer i would not have seen this movie if i would have known i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie i am tired of it i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie i have never been more disappointed in a movie nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie no one would have seen it
<START> ah mcbainÂ the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by the simpsons but it will also always Â to me personally at least Â remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90's action flick directed by the cool dude who brought us the exterminator and starring two of the most ultimately badass b movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside the latter with a cute little macho ponytail i guess mcbain will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure because there's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture the film is unimaginably preposterous most action heroes take on a small gangster posse Â mcbain takes on an entire country and yet takes itself way too seriously the script is a non stop and incoherent spitfire of clichÃ©d situations nonsensical twists compulsory sentimental interludes grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings it's a totally delirious movie i loved it br br vietnam pow mcbain's life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos' debt eighteen years later santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's publicly executed on el presidente's balcony his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower mcbain and his former vietnam buddies who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop ass br br okay let's not fool each other here the fact you're reading a user comment on mcbain already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low budget b movie action one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of mcbain this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it heck i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list like the preposterous and needless heroic self sacrifice of a soldier who doesn't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain's squad but what's the point you definitely know not to expect a 100 coherent and plausible masterpiece we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie and it's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel please don't expect another apocalypse now this particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and Â last but not least Â a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of brothers in arms
<START> i loved the the film it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed for instance the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth br br for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film a great pity br br the one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm
<START> i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so long and unfortunately it wasn't worth it even for a die hard lynch fan i found this to be really tedious br br nothing happens there are long long long painful pauses where nothing happens long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell it was all about what happened before and what happened afterward br br there was a mulholland drive allusion the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita esque and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly br br unfortunately it's all very uninteresting and very dull nothing happens it's very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it sorry david
<START> i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me br br when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a life changing event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
<START> this is one of those films that i remember being in the can for years before anything happening w it i don't think it's terrible but it's not really good either alec baldwin was pretty good but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best the cast is pretty good in what they're given but again you are only as good as the script baldwin directing this although i could have sworn he didn't direct all of it i thought i read somewhere or lots of re shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there although his work on 30 rock is nothing short of genius should keep him busy for a little while longer i just hope the show bows out gracefully a la seinfeld but maybe not even that long 9 years it went so if you want to see a film that you won't get much from but won't really hate either well this is for you i can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released only on dvd at that it was nice to see alec baldwin anthony hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen the edge now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment
<START> cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex that's hardly a spoiler br br the set up is simplicity itself film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast this also neatly okay messily disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines the rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely jessica napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her br br there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate good soundtrack too if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre probably a bit of both
