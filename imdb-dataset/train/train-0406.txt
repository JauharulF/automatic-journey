<START> about 4 years ago i liked this movie i would watch it over and over and over but now i don't actually i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000 it has a bunch of comment heavy actors macaulay culkin christopher lloyd patrick stewart whoopi goldberg and a pretty cheesy plot my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says hey tyler where ya goin' the moon also look out for the classic line do you have feeling in your toes br br on the other hand it's better than the good son
<START> i have no idea how to describe this movie and also would love to provide others the same opportunity i had seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect i enjoyed it immensely but can also say i barely understood what was going on if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place fans of david lynch tangentially or especially guy maddin films should particularly enjoy this and any fans of the comic book eightball will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder it came as close as any film i've seen to the tone and mood dan clowes creates so effectively br br one slight note just to warn anyone easily offended this movie if rated would be nc 17 for sure fans of male full frontal nudity however hmm well yes this is weird wild stuff
<START> loretta castorini cher is a woman in her late thirties a widow who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in brooklyn she is engaged to marry johnny cammareri danny aiello a bland man more out of a resigned duty than actual love before their wedding johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding ronny nicholas cage hasn't forgiven johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand and subsequently his then bride to be but he does fall for loretta and hard after a heated affair loretta out of respect for johnny tries to avoid ronny but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over meanwhile loretta's mother rose castorini olympia dukakis is not only suspecting her husband cosmo vincent gardenia is seeing another woman but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women things get complicated when johnny returns from sicily to tell loretta they can't be married br br the setup is pure sitcom but the story written by john patrick shanley with a deep understanding for italian americans living in new york is genuine he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day to day foibles and quirks and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story loretta a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of la boheme the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand in a clever gender reversal and cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep dark beauty ronny is pure fire and nicholas cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling marlon brando the castorini's and the cappomaggi's counterbalancing the central couple both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments the latter couple on the night of the full moon when loretta and ronny consummate their affair a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when rose bluntly reveals in touching words that she wants cosmo to stop seeing his mistress mona anita gillette br br moonstruck is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people the ending is a tour de force of emotional impact the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel good movie to a classic moonstruck deservedly got its oscars for best writing actress and supporting actress and has proved to grow beyond its time
<START> the image of movie studios being financially driven instead of creatively is not without truth in fact it's more true than false this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full length uncut version of hamlet with his complete creative control among other things of course branagh had to agree to some concessions a star studded cast and a 2 5 hour version for wider release but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see could they have at least in this case had enough respect for the material and branagh's vision to create something for only a few people that is not a question that i can answer whatever the reason this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching hamlet everyone knows the story so i will not spend much time on that however unlike other productions of the play stage included this is a completely uncut production which has never been done before according to some shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion that being said i have no doubt that had he been able to see it the bard would have been overjoyed with branagh's production br br the film is top heavy with film stars although most have mere bit parts all play their parts equally well i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet and while he still may be his performance more than makes up for it hamlet is a complex part displaying every emotion from grief to anger happiness to madness and everything in between branagh nailed it derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role julie christie is also very good as gertrude hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game br br the classical actors are cast in bit parts judi dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines but at least they're in it surprisingly no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all and it shows special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal who are excellent robin williams is a little too silly but he's not bad his part is pretty small anyway br br yet this is undeniably branagh's show he adapted one of the most famous plays in history and in so doing he took on a whale of a project it's impressive that he got it done but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement what i really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it as most people know shakespeare is difficult to digest but branagh and his cast understand this hamlet is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting br br this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but it's definitely worth it
<START> one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called pon one missed call was just as boring as that one maybe phones just aren't scary or something but this move was dull and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didn't keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie and it is ridiculous to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device
<START> major league back to the minors 1998 Â½ br br starring scott bakula eric bruskotter corbin bernsen dennis haysbert jensen daggett written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg 13 for language and some violence br br by blake french br br believe it or not in the new john warren comedy major league back to the minors there is one funny scene it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face it's not much but with the exception of a few one liners it's all this film has to offer enough said br br this movie is not only structurally impaired characteristically undeveloped predictable and badly written but also just plain bad even non critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got it is so familiar it just isn't funny br br how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made last years we saw this same material in air bud golden receiver and as bad as that film was this is even worse at least air bud was family oriented major league back to the minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon it is too childish for adults so who is this film for teenagers elderly people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this br br the film like many others like this has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes where the silly announcers form their own buddy comedy routine muttering one liners to themselves like they suck this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost maybe it was his mind somebody needs a nap and ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny br br major league back to the minors is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence the good baseball team is on a comeback they are about to win and the power goes out i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion but in reality its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny there is another kind of funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer the coach's answer you're too old too slow and too fat the player's reaction is to die for but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time and certainly is not worth a cent of your money br br so here is another dreadful entrÃ©e into this genre of film another that is doomed with its own script which is failed before seen and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again br br
<START> this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi
<START> the first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with which is exactly what a young latino girl does in girlfight ' written and directed by karyn kusama diana michelle rodriguez is an eighteen year old high school senior from the projects in brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester she affects a whatever' attitude which masks a deep seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go she lives with her father sandro paul calderon with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother tiny ray santiago with her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her and one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where tiny trains ironically tiny wants nothing to do with boxing he wants to go to art school but sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons when diana convinces tiny's trainer hector jaime tirelli to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money ultimately with tiny's help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home it's an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better and the fact that she will have to fight men not women in gender blind' competitions does not faze her in the least diana has found her element br br first time writer director karyn kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere and there's no candy coating on it either as hector tells diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is i was a fighter once i lost ' then looking around the busy gym like most of these guys they're going to lose too but it's all they know ' and it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is it's a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run down gym you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know br br making her screen debut michelle rodriguez is perfectly cast as diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves she is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really rodriguez exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin whatever it is it works it's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation she certainly makes diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out br br as positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note though diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of hector after all realistically and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women and in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate br br the supporting cast includes santiago douglas adrian elisa bocanegra marisol alicia ashley ricki and thomas barbour ira though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of girlfight ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring that aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience i rate this one 7 10 br br br br
<START> full house is one of the worst tv series ever why because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally an that girl dj who wrote her character i want to kill my self every time she speaks not to mention when danny start's with his philosophy br br example dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino however she's not eighteen so she shouldn't gamble according to law however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny her father cought's her and don't let's her raise that money because she is not eighteen oh come on give me a break will ya since i've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television some of the thing's they say in this series not even a child would bought who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny every single word they say in this series seem's like shakespeare wrote it except that shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house br br for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world i deeply recommend 'do not watch the full house' not even one episode as a try out avoid this series save your self from stupidity and nonsense this is the worst television show ever i'd rather watch teletubbies then this 'do not watch this'
<START> updated from a previous comment the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines a bit player in crude comedies they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star br br a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions davies haines are a wonderful team and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glyn norma talmadge mae murray rod larocque leatrice joy dorothy sebastian estelle taylor louella parsons renee adoree aileen pringle and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still maligned marion davies dell henderson plays the father polly moran is a maid paul ralli is the slimy leading man br br show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model i think mae murray is closer davies and swanson were friends but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early 20s br br davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie they're great together a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear
<START> as a young black latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately i didn't although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant the story was simply not properly developed the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more honestly i would recommend a film like raising victor over this one any day i just was not too impressed
<START> this is quite literally the worst movie i have ever watched in my life it may be the worst movie possible some movies are so bad that they're good this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful it is the anti enantiodromia we bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor peter sellers br br this is worse than the animated lord of the rings it is worse than the matrix sequels it is worse than krull it is worse than any batman movie br br do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television
<START> i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday intending to tune in to something else out of curiosity i accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end i really didn't do so with intent this was one of those movies where you're fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano and their earlier roles but great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hi jinks we all know that perry mason before raymond burr passed the 300 lb mark and ben matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them no real life judge or prosecutor would stand for this br br both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer actually perry nearly always did this but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party sometimes on camera sometimes presumed at the end of the show br br but that said holland taylor's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of matlock mason more closely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real life courtrooms br br every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable or some combination of two or more of these br br the ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible but again fascinating because of this ladd and spano are attractive individuals and t v movies would appear their best forte probably best in 2nd lead probably better if 3rd roles even in this venue taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them give this one 1 star for the story performances and 3 additional for the fascination factor
<START> only the antichrist could have been behind such a disaster one only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the film this movie was so bad it forced me to register with imdb finally just so i could trash it what makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such great source material i have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts br br it may seem insignificant but i'd like to start with the score as the proud owner of a music degree i must register my indignation i was torn between laughter and dry heaves as i listened to what john scheffer did to goldsmith's brilliant score it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes and almost as inadvertently comedic it was by far the most inappropriate score i've heard since well i really can't think of a worse one maybe jaws 4 br br as for the plot i'm sorry new age mysticism what ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy in those films more so in the first two than the third but still the supernatural was for the most part implied and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable here we have crystals going black calling all skeksis and mystics and inverted crucifixes galore even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche in its place a boorish slap in the face of recycled clichÃ© and transparent incompetence add to that a lead actress so unbelievably annoying that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent never have i seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little stephanie ruined all in the family br br other than that i have no strong feelings on the subject luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or at the very most a study in how not to make a film viewer beware may induce vomiting if you're lucky
<START> i'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti christian pseudo documentary got now i respect the guy's opinion and faith i myself am not at this state believer of the taught christian doctrine however anti christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue br br this film has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context i'm not recommending against seeing it in fact i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings rather than an inquiring approach on the subject it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists no moderation in between br br the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti christian historians and writers i actually found the headmaster to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry br br with this being said there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased
<START> for my humanities quarter project for school i chose to do human trafficking after some research on the internet i found this dvd and ordered it i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can say is wow it is such a compelling story of a 12 year old vietnamese girl named holly and an american man named patric who tries to save her the ending leaves you breathless and although it's not a happily ever after ending it is very realistic it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next
<START> for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be there was no doubt about it being funny and bad because i had seen voyna i mir 1968 shall we begin here we go br br robert dornhelm brendan donnison's pierre bezukhov a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original robert dornhelm brendan donnison's natasha rostova a scarecrow her image can cause insomnia robert dornhelm brendan donnison's andrej bolkonsky an ok incarnation which like the lean fellow cf above lacks depth of a russian soul and struggle within robert dornhelm brendan donnison's napoleon a rather unimpressive leader robert dornhelm brendan donnison's prince bolkonsky a turd with an english face robert dornhelm brendan donnison's count bezukhov a spineless freak show br br the rest of the characters are not much better br br the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious they behave like modern eu citizens dressed up for a one day masquerade it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early 19th century br br a good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of we had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product which had been shown the previous evening on our tv br br user rating 8 0 10 29 votes i guess many young people have never watched our film voyna i mir 1968 or have weird sense of tarantino spielberg quality remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend turns around shoots and the bridge goes boom looks like a cgi explosion br br there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel which was screened properly in our country once but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of gone with the wind hey directors wake up and get busy with that instead of spoiling our classics br br now back to common sense jokes aside what i mentioned above is nothing new though deadly exaggerated br br to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians while participating in very serious epics and dramas is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again of course it results in numerous laughs especially clemence poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think this sucks so much that it's funny br br in order to say something new i'd like to mention the pace of the movie to my mind this new version is very patchy the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing they stagger and pop up like in a modern video again i have to remember our voyna i mir where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy going with the flow br br i thought that maybe the borodino battle would be great to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968 br br there should be something good in this movie after all and there is the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined the losers' team plus 1 point for that recklessness it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best it all evokes pity and sometimes fits of laughter br br what i still like about this serial is the last part of it it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her salary and taxes besides judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene which would definitely kill the whole project but fortunately it does not have such rubbish and that's a big plus br br voyna i mir is no harry potter and nowadays even we here in present day russia do not have enough craft to film it properly do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely fortunately a proper film was screened during our soviet times the american version of the 1950s was justified to some extent ours did not even exist yet there were extenuating circumstances then br br 4 out of 10 1 point is given from the start 1 point goes for the recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the serial thanks for attention
<START> my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of it br br this had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it weren't for mystery science theater i wouldn't be here today p
<START> in spite of the great future design touches the clever asimov premise and will smith's dependable cool performance this movie doesn't live up to expectations the clichÃ©s come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject 'nanites' you know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but it's less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years
