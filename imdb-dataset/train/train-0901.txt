<START> in the film kongwon do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness as well as general meaninglessness into the lives of various koreans empty people seeking ways to fill themselves enjoying the escapism of nature from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters we learn of their shortcomings and their desires the overall complexity captured within human life and yet the overal simplicity of humanity although the film is slow moving it can be very contemplative it does not force any ideas but allows the ideas to come about themselves it allows the concepts to reveal themselves br br the film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness that love is often an act of selfishness and the many mistakes that we make it is a look into everyday life very well and beautifully done br br if you are looking for action or for intense drama this is not the film for you however if you enjoy honest original and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz this is a great film to watch
<START> ok so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good i remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40 in england this film was released as liar it's a dog it is a total waste of good celluloid 4 10 for the photograpy and set only
<START> it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like shÃ´ kasugi christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect b adventure of all time it's actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it's flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it's made in the 90s it doesn't have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just can't hate it i think it's an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song
<START> i'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script this is easily the worst sequel ever made br br they killed navin johnson not only was mark blankfield's performance god awful so was everyone elses the physical comedy was forced flat and predictable the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent less buffoon director michael schultz should be ashamed of himself br br i want the 96 minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity
<START> i saw this movie in a theater in chicago and should have enjoyed it since i love nemesisÂ but if the first half an hour is skillfully done the rest is just sub predator video fodder a long chase through those post modern empty factories pyun affectionnates my girlfriend fell asleep i still like pyun though but not this
<START> writer director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast william h macy tracy ullman john ritter neve campbell donald sutherland barbara bain david dorfman brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see br br panic is the story of a hit man alex macy who actually works for his father sutherland he covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances he and his wife ullman and their son sammy dorfman are a typical suburban family unhappy with his life alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ritter telling only his mother bain in the waiting room he meets a young woman campbell to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist when alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist br br this is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother's knowledge who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit his rage is so deep seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression when it's time for panic to moves it does quickly br br panic doesn't seem panicked at all in fact it moves very slowly but it moves slowly not because it's poorly made the slowness is deliberate mirroring alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog by making a decision about sara the campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they don't jive and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche sammy's br br william macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated br br this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater it's too adult too small too subtle too character driven and too good
<START> the grudge is a remake of shimizu's own series of popular japanese horror films shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride he uses commonly known clichÃ©s associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives at the end all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience the same way a comedy is to make people laugh this movie succeeded with flying colors i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one it probably doesn't play as well in your living room
<START> what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films so could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated prison is the finnish director harlin's american debut which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison re opened for the cause of over population in other more modern state penitentiaries inside the former execution dungeons the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around the now promoted warden eaton sharpe lane smith was there already 40 years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past br br prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain unlike any other horror picture from that decade prison features an amazing sense of realism by this i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror the absolute best terror moment providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age focuses on a grizzly death struggle involving barbed wire haunting the screenplay only suffers one flaw but that's a common one almost inevitable i guess clichÃ©s the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding we've got the ugly fat pervert with his 'cute' boy toy the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and Â naturally Â the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman don't stare yourself blind on these clichÃ©s is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire the photography is dark and moist the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate roles of class b actors are excellent the fans will recognize tom everett tom 'tiny' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder forget about wes craven's god awful attempt shocker or the downright pathetic cheese flick the chair this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves hobbits and other fairy creatures this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd release
<START> may contain a spoiler of sorts the mere mention of crispin glover is enough to send some geek's panties in a bunch his landmark appearance in back to the future as george mcfly has sealed him into the american conscience forever more recently he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with bartleby and willard br br this time however crispin has made a 76 minute cheap dada film at times it reminded me of genius while overall it almost insulted me but not because of its content content what is it is a movie where in one half of the movie all of the actors have down's syndrome giving it a freakshow feel to it the other half of the movie includes crispin glover adam parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy this all had the feel of what john waters was attempting to do with desperate living and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably br br the half with the down's syndrome actors also features many many killed snails it is about a guy who has snails and ends up killing one he is also tormented by a bunch of other people and a grasshopper he falls in love with 2 girls one of which he has sex with in a graveyard he also has a falling out with a friend who teases him br br in a weird semi interior set crispin glover is the director of this show he is something like the control of the guy's mind and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality well he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes there is other shocking imagery made humorous like nazi swaztikas crossed with shirley temple and minstrels in black face saying they're michael jackson br br in the outside world the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people they beat him with rocks and such later they beat the minstrel after putting him on trial br br back to the interior crispin glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everybody but fails miserably br br what is it makes less sense than dr caligari and has more than a passing style stolen from it the claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the no wall sets of dr caligari felt claustrophobic they also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense and it was all wrapped up with absurdist imagery for humor br br the problem is about 20 minutes into the movie maybe a little more what is it runs out of imagery for the next 56 minutes we keep running on the same sets of images only introducing new imagery in the form of an absurdist puppet show the movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the envelope in offensive and taboo imagery it tries to mock and confuse the audience but the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute movie br br even worse than that the cinematography set design and everything else felt very very cheap and almost unplanned it felt like ok this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way it didn't feel interesting and was quite boring dr caligari on the other hand had amazing cinematography and framing the difference between the two is quite astounding br br rating c
<START> this film has great acting great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are how you define yourself how you fit in whether you accept to play a role or break free there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects i want to comment on the formal setting of the film basically it's two people on a roof there is unity of place and time with 2 protagonists and the radio acting as the choir many directors have turned greek tragedies into film many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy but no director in my opinion has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting a masterpiece
<START> i saw chan is missing when it first came out about four years after moving from san francisco to new york maybe it was the perspective of a few years away but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else i'd ever seen still does it concentrates on one particular community the chinese but that's fine because so much of the city's soul is refracted through the settings the faces and the maybe above all the voices of the characters br br this isn't the tourists' san francisco the settings are humble and everyday a taxi cab the kitchen of a chinese restaurant richmond district row houses little chinatown apartments and small business offices the piers a philippine elder center this is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there even now in the era of silicon gulch urban redevelopment unlike say dirty harry in its own way an excellent san francisco movie as well everything is filmed at street level we come to understand the characters' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them not from some fancy vertiginous shooting br br wang apparently filmed in b w because he didn't have the money to do otherwise yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves the often harsh pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with san francisco it seems to expose everything bringing the buildings the hills the other landmarks down in scale and in a funny way making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place wang's photography perfectly conveys this and even helps the story along at points br br wang captures the speech and conversational style of chinese and other san franciscans better than anyone ever has i think if there's such thing as a true san francisco accent it's what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker i think who appears talking on the phone in one scene listen to the way he calls the person on the other end ya dingaling br br the story is poignant and despite a few very small missteps makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities including the justified political and ethnic resentments and little ironic amusements that help to fuel them all this is communicated delicately perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders it doesn't suffice it to say that the two cab drivers' quest for chan becomes a quest for something more personal br br chan is missing finishes up with a chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s i guess about san francisco and all its crazy diversity an american caricature yes but somehow not entirely off the mark either
<START> words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight i really wish i hadn't done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn't last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious br br please do not watch any part of this film
<START> to compare this squalor with an old low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old low budget porno flick the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part Âgripping retelling of the btk killer's reign of terror this is not a retelling a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why none of these things are true i'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly this is not one of them this isn't even about the btk killer save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead that serial killer movie is accurate and true however if you just have to see this movie for yourself check it out for free at your local library and even then you'll still feel cheated
<START> written by the writer who penned the excellent murder rooms series which chronicled acd's adventures with doctor joseph bell i was looking forward to this and i wasn't disappointed it was quite slow moving with a lot of emphasis on doyle's frustration at sherlock holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed it was an interesting character study and very well shot on digital video unusual for a period piece the acting was excellent all round particularly tim mcinnery and brian cox although the actor who portrayed acd whose name i cannot remember impressed me no end an excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal sherlock holmes case do see this if you get the chance
<START> one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphia here i come i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both it's the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he can't earn a living in ireland it is told both from the perspective of the young man whom the other characters in the film can see and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film it is a very sad movie but deeply touching and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about i love any irish movie or almost any movie about ireland and any film that has the late irish actor donal mccann in it gets my vote i would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen and unfortunately i have terrible shame to have lost him so young
<START> i actually thought this is a comedy and sat watching it expecting to laugh my ass off pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy or at least not a 'jim carrey type' one what kept we watching was the characters the movie starts with some pretty grim troubled people gathered together to try and fight one of their basic fears fear of water fear of swimming we start to get bit by bit into their lives witness their troubles guess of their thoughts br br actually i made it look much darker than it actually is and besides the chain of events soon brings some light and hope to their lives br br i probably wouldn't have watched the movie had i known its not a comedy but rather a drama but i had good time enjoyed the story and don't mind i spent about 90 minutes with it br br many films treat the alienation between people in the western world this movie shows how people can get together and help each other br br and if in the light of dying day you meet her don't let her pass you by and leave don't loose her she is your gift from the sun br br 9 10 br br peace and love
<START> i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal she couldn't dance for peanuts she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting she seemed in a trance but i hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a count marion a top mimic also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand that was gloria swanson spot on br br colonel pepper dell henderson has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood determined to prove that his daughter peggy marion davies will be the greatest star ever their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone william haines who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely who was that short little guy when she finds out she faints peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of it's marion davies br br she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress but she can't cry it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds she can't stop her new leading man andre paul ralli convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated she even adopts a new name patricia pepoire she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad she has developed a star personality when the slapstick studio picks the same location as patricia's movie billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew br br after a studio luncheon a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day patricia gets a call from the boss it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a countess even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a count than he is on her wedding day billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for her br br it was amazing to see all the guest stars john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates lew cody is talking to elinor glynn who not only wrote it but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies william haines another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see was great especially in the cafeteria scene he had wonderful comic timing harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all i'm giving this film 10 out of 10 br br highly highly recommended
<START> as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists br br we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie br br the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta's shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse br br this movie is so bad i wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section br br do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth
<START> there are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as pierre fresnay should not have accepted to act in it br br i think just the opposite that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses the performance of pierre fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent br br his performance is probably the best in history br br the film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret br br for somebody who does not believe that a priest Â even a defrocked one Â can convert it in christ's blood the scene is perhaps bizarre but for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant br br the scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking but it is very well acted pierre fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character the tortured defrocked morand who in this terrible way comes back to his duty
<START> i like to keep my reviews short and simple but this pretty much sums it up you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris columbous br br this movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting i cant even believe these people are considered actors br br painful to sit through and watch the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back horrible rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself br br the movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot
