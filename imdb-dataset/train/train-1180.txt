<START> the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group in their endeavors the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin whom sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose the story isn't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off then threatens him it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then
<START> i lived in tokyo for 7 months knowing the reality of long train commutes bike rides from the train station soup stands and other typical scenes depicted so well certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really really liked there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie director suo's tricks were subtle for the most part i found his highlighting the character called tamako tamura with a soft filter making her sublime a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters or cried or laughed aloud wonderful a
<START> i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and lesbianism in the romanian society br br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasn't visible at all br br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didn't get through br br i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack br br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8 10 not enough sensuality in the key moments br br a total of 7 10 mostly for the story
<START> what is most striking about this semi musical set in 1920s berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing it's top of the line from first national in these departments the story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of miller's other two films sunny sally where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval complications and final clinch all the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy miller sings parts of i think of baby and reprises because of you there are also don't ever be blue and though you're not the first one br br miller here is very engaging and delightful quite reminiscent of irene dunne in manner and delivery sad she does not dance as that is her forte sally remains her finest film with this trailing as second and the rather poor sunny a vastly inferior runner up her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable it's worth visiting these films though to see ziegfeld's top star of the twenties
<START> this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence and i can think of no other movie documentary or drama that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about dmd and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that you're alive and it's a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema see this movie
<START> words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is i wish it were so bad it's good but it's not it's just dull lifeless and boring it's so bad i couldn't even laugh at it br br in response to other posters anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead they both look like inbreeds sister and brother br br the gal sherry thurig is a looker the complete opposite of anne marie attractive this girl is tall and willowy and can act although you can tell she's holding back br br all the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male mark i've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than kelly why would kelly keep his actors from acting is he really that bad a director everyone else has summed the story up perfectly there isn't one kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime i know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how i felt after watching his movie br br yes i tried to get my money back from the rental store this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks
<START> is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you'll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn't have much of a budget compared to spielberg's herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap i've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells' novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielberg's budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he's foisted on us br br primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he's returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that's all that happens ok i'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character's house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkity yak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessert br br thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g wells' text else we'd have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone can't convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he's a filmmaker so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning br br secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci fi's have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects don't need to be complex they can even be crude e g fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines' effects are both crude and incompetent Â tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum Â martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort Â skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice Â and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that's less than convincing fine we can work around that just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away it's not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don't show it twice but no hines won't listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boy br br next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he's getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree let's have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they aren't even good amateurs but this needn't prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting that's what directors are for and editors which brings up another pointÂ who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herky jerky effect that's nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's if he was i can say he doesn't know how to do it
<START> i was in second grade 12 years ago i remember it clearly we were learning about space all little kids want to go to space right well after i saw this i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind i had no idea that this was a movie i thought it was some news program or something i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds ' so recently i get this movie again to watch realizing my favorite actor joaquin phoenix was in it then known as leaf phoenix i can tell you i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting i mean when andy is in space she moves in slow motion did you ever notice that i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow br br the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank and begins to float backwards as the security doors close little max is trying to pull her in suddenly we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts in slow motion whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg i had no idea
<START> this is a very bad movie i laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring through the whole short movie i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end br br no one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see it looked funny but the bottom line don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie br br i was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse stupid all the way to the end i walked out of the theater and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever br br the writer and co producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer but this is nothing like the simpsons this movie sucks
<START> prussic gas a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish the inspectors at scotland yard higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried schÃ¼renberg certainly have their hands full with this case it all seems to center around student ann portland uschi glas who when she turns 21 is to inherit a great deal of wealth the girls who are targeted share a room with ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy's finest must figure out the staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation it's a clever scheme where a driver greaves gÃ¼nter meisner meets the convicts who hide in a barrel who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress her author brother a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the bannister some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered the ending features multiple twists br br out of the krimi films i've seen the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit which isn't used the fake bible water pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of startled victims the greaves' royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins' abilities to get at the truth perhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it i felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues facts often avoiding sir john as much as possible capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions i'd say this may be one of the best if not the best examples of the krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up it's sleeve the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye opening and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off
<START> i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here br br kudos to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry czerny and the kid br br it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit it deserved more recognition it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well it's an instant classic nonetheless
<START> cosimo luis guzman ends up in prison for car burglary and there he's given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison so he has to get out of jail fast he tells his girlfriend rosalind patricia clarkson to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money but no one wants to do the time for cosimo's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that soon bad boxer pero mahalovic sam rockwell founds out the details of this so called perfect job br br first of all i think this movie was very funny and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone this movie is remake of italian comedy i soliti ignoti i didn't watch the italian original so i cannot judge or compare those two movies but welcome to collinwood is great comedy for itself about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast really excellent movie for these actors sam rockwell william h macy great isaiah washington michael jeter great luis guzmÃ¡n patricia clarkson jennifer esposito and finally george clooney gave their share in this project br br maybe to say that this movie is only comedy isn't fair this is more then that because of one difference all of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked what will they do with their money it is mostly securing their future in very humble way this fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals and not only them but also cop babitch who is presented like corrupted one so here directors russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same actually all in collinwood are and not only in collinwood cause all people chase money on legal or illegal way i don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves but this one is exception you have to love them all riley with his little baby and wife in jail toto with his pants cosimo with his line your mother's a whore and all others they are just like characters in my favorite comic alan ford they all trying to make some money but simply they are out of luck but they all did one good deed they gave money to riley so he can get his wife out of prison they are all heroes in my eyes cause lots of honest people wouldn't do that
<START> this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care 90 of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever i laughed so much my ribs began to ache the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'
<START> i appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline i found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was 110 minutes imdb shows one at 125m possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet
<START> foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly perfectly fit together shot by shot edit by edit the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose or lack thereof the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece
<START> this film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s buck while some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected that it wasn't the asian equivalent of blackface back then there were not really any asian actors in america not even george takei was acting and rainer did a good job with her part it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old school pre method acting it was nice the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects br br i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it br br the film had some parallels to the john ford style but i think the eastern influence affected it as well if this had been an western family the locusts would have won at the end punishing the farmer for his pride lust and gluttony however here he learns his lesson then wins
<START> five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before it is boiler room it is the firm and it is the devils advocate and there are no new elements here except for the all to clear bill gates allegory conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie making but why does it have to be so extreme boiler room is a good movie because it for a while at least seems realistic in antitrust everything is wrong how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you i'd give it 1 but the soundtrack is ok so 2 10
<START> of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one
<START> i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting as the title suggests the film focuses on a 'rogue' in this case one that steals womanises and smuggles stuff that's basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure and that is the case here too she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer
<START> john leguizemo a wonderful comic actor is a new york latino able to get inside a myriad of characters both male and female to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture he is not however italian he doesn't look think or behave italian especially sicilian or calabrese immigrant groups who live in bensonhurst or bayridge brooklyn every scene in which he interacts with his gumbas rings false as though he'd wandered in from a college production of west side story while the other guys were doing a low rent mean streets that's only one problem with this ill conceived mean spirited flick spike blew this one big time btw cbgbomfug means country bluegrass blues and other music for uplifting gourmets or possibly gourmands ask hilly crystal who founded the club br br
