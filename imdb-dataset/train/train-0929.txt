<START> i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one's heard of and could be a possible gem i saw this and since i'm a fan of violence and gore i got it it got the rating of em which means extremely mature thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else i got it the warning on the box said extreme violence extreme langauge and nudity the extreme violence struck my fancy the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick it had one or two gory scenes but i've seen worse in a pg 13 movie of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts right you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it don't rent it i speak the truth i can't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say i'm gonna rent that again it had it's moments where it kept you going but i'm never going to see that film again
<START> my 2 year old likes the doodlebops show it seems to keep his attention for awhile the characters are interesting vibrant with primary colours and all there's not much educational content that the intended target audience could benefit from but they do seem to have a theme each show and try to teach kids about sharing and respect and other basics so i like it for that it's well produced with high production values but it's really just an average show like most of the shows on tv these days we don't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything dooblebop i don't think we'd spend money to go to a live show if they ever came to town going to the zoo or the science centre is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is money better spent
<START> this short film that inspired the soon to be full length feature spatula madness is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this film's 15 minute running time is absorbed by some odd ball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show but it's surely follows it plot better than many high budget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and don't expect a deep story
<START> c'mon people you can't be serious another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn't this isn't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork made for the next party to get the girls laid br br the gore is incredibly bad even the eye scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head the girl is just laying there rubber faced not moving at all it would have been funnier to use a real doll instead br br one season of i'm a celebrity get me out of here is more frightening than this one don't waste your time or your money
<START> reese witherspooon's first movie loved it the plot and the acting was top notch you are emotionally involved with the characters in my opinion a must see br br after watching this movie you will see why reese witherspoon's acting career has been so successful br br the other cast members do a great job also br br the movie flows extremely well there is not a boring moment in the whole picture the man in the moon's length is just right br br as i said earlier i think this movie was excellent i have seen it numerous times and have enjoyed every one of the viewings
<START> the cast of this film contain some of new zealander's better actors many of who i have seen in fabulous roles this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot most of the cast appear to be from the great long running new zealand soap shortland street it's as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party the result of too many gins and possibly a bit of salmonella imagine under siege meets the love boat staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea br br if you are an actor i recommend you see this film as a study on how to destroy your carer
<START> a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors' fault but the writer director producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it isn't this rape and ultra violence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding it's no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that i'm probably being a bit unfair on pete walker br br revenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort br br i don't think it's particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details the blood running down ga's leg post rape par example it's neither challenging nor confrontational though i'm sure the film makers consider themselves very 'daring' just deeply unpleasant br br is this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times oh the customs but the new spell check on imdb wouldn't let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square parentheses get it sorted imdb br br where is the lofty aspiration the noble impulse when you look at british film the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers carol reed's work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in havana or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads the work of powell pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at the offence' dir sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to say br br unlike the foregoing straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid
<START> bullfighter was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason i wonder why could it be the confusing storyline the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez and the annoying editing it's got to be i think the plot was mary michelle forbes and jacque oliver martinez go on a mystical road trip they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too the movie looks great and there is a lot of style but there is no substance most movies when trying to subtle don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects br br don't be fooled by the cover willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most
<START> imagine you're a high school boy in the back of a dark uncrowded theater with your girlfriend how bad would a movie have to be in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended this movie is that bad really movies often become so bad that they're good this movie is beyond that stage of bad ness it is painfully bad horribly terribly crime against humanity bad
<START> i had high expectations of this movie the title translated is how we get rid of the others after all the concept is great a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right wing government's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so called freeloaders and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're contributing something to the establishment the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology br br very cool idea ideal for biting satire only this movie completely blows its chance the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not sustained it is neither sharp nor witty and for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes the comedy i assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over serious rather than evoking either laughter or thought br br the script is rife with grave errors in disposition the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and who's trying to save everybody by organizing a resistance that ships people to africa all this is beside the point a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious it's a satire a political statement but it doesn't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about maybe it was afraid of going too far how cowardly that's not art it's not even real satire br br sÃ¸ren pilmark a very serious and by now one of denmark's absolutely senior actors was very good he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for lene poulsen who did supply a convincing performance br br in fact a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural neither the formulation nor the delivery why is it so difficult to make it sound right why must it be so stilted and artificial i hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they don't think that this was how people talked in general danish society br br 3 out of 10
<START> undeveloped unbelievable story line by the time i sort of figured out where it was going i no longer cared bad casting come on william macy as a hit man bad directing have you ever seen tracey ullman perform so badly was i supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent uncaring john ritter character bad script really i'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful the only really good thing in it was the kid ten lines it's not ok if your comment is less than ten lines come on whose rules are those why can't i say what i have to say in less than 10 lines isn't that kind of arbitrary why isn't it ok to have less than 10 lines of comment
<START> cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie worthy performance here if there ever was one it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling dial it down think zombie only less lively through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson's effort the rest of the cast is barely better jennifer agutter of logan's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role if the quality of the acting was three times better if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark lifetime tv channel crowd as is its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time perhaps the late night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such
<START> the blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever sung by an uncredited burt bacharach of all people you really have to hear it to believe it the blob may be worth watching just for this song alone my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics after this unnerving opening credits sequence the blob introduces us the viewer that is to steve andrews steve mcqueen as steven mcqueen his girlfriend jane martin aneta corsaut who are parked on their own somewhere witness what looks like a meteorite falling to earth in nearby woods an old man olin howland as olin howlin who lives in a cabin also sees it goes to investigate he finds a crater a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick if you know what i mean it then slides up the stick attachÃ©s itself to the old man's hand meanwhile steve jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of steve's car steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to dr t hallan alden 'stephen' chase as steven chase at the local surgery dr hallan says he doesn't know what the substance on the old man's hand is but it's getting bigger asks steve to go back where he found him see if he can find out what happened steve agrees but doesn't come up with anything upon returning to dr hallan's surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him the town's police lieutenant dave earl rowe the teenage hating sergeant jim bert john benson unsurprisingly don't believe a word of it end up suspecting steve his mates al anthony franke tony robert fields someone called 'mooch' miller james bonnet of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department however as the blob continues to eat it's way through the town steve sets about finding proof of it's existence convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world br br directed irvin s yeaworth jr an uncredited russell s doughton jr i was throughly disappointed by this the original 1958 version of the blob the script by kay linaker as kate phillips theodore simonson is an absolute bore extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects the blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics conflicts between the teenagers police in fact the majority of the blob is spent on steve trying to convince the police of the blob's existence for most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential somewhat forgotten it only has two or three scenes for the fist hour a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards yuck why couldn't the blob just eat the lot of 'em no explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space how long did it take them to come up with that the dialogue is clunky silly as well as are people's actions decision making i love the part when a nurse named kate lee paton as lee payton did anyone use their real name in this thing is confronted by the blob she throws some acid over it calmly proclaims doctor nothing will stop it how does she know 'nothing' will stop it exactly there's no blood or violence so don't worry about that the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time moves very slowly a bit like the film in general actually the acting is terrible mcqueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old it shows he looks old enough to be his own dad same thing goes for most of the other 'teenage' cast members everyone generally speaking are wooden unconvincing in their roles technically the blob is very basic dark static photography dull direction forgettable production values the blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper is well known as being a 'classic' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen this is one case when the remake the blob 1988 is definitely better than the original the original blob is slow boring the remake isn't the original blob contains no blood or gore the remake does the original blob has incredibly poor acting casting decisions the remake doesn't the original blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film the remake features the blob all the way through it virtually eats an entire town the choice is an easy one the remake every time as it's a better film in every respect i'll give the film two stars give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own definitely not the classic many seem to make out
<START> this movie is a fantastic movie everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing i know mr garfield was blacklisted in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd that being the case why isn't this one a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it if it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go mr garfield did a superb job of portraying mr schmid some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr schmid's disability but i feel he got it just right i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two
<START> i don't'know maybe it's because i'm brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it's not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i'm not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people
<START> this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case i'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too i'm glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in work br br notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing don't buy it
<START> this movie is suppose to be a mysterious serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl however 30 minutes into the movie it turns into a funny unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes i can't imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he bear punches that old lady the lines characters and acting are all poorly done from the get go i've always liked nicolas cage as an actor but he has made some terrible movies this year this being by far the worst one yet br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story gripping thriller if you really want to enjoy this story go rent the original however if you intend on watching it get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously that's the only way you enjoy this film
<START> i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 because the stories are open ended and left unexplained and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way plus scenes of a decaying corpse br br neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner br br the film's plot such as it is concerns three loosely interconnecting stories none of which conclude satisfactorily br br the bounty hunter played by bruce dern is the character that connects all three vignettes br br first we have dylan mcdermott looking darn fine as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through a border town and spots a sad faced saloon girl played by helen hunt br br then we have one of the hemingway girls not sure which one playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman an attractive redhead whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long br br the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension
<START> wasn't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn't disappoint br br for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent which made me feel better about mine which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie br br the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope br br however the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible br br on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections they only last 5 minutes anyway br br ca vaut la peine
<START> expecting a combination of scifi and period film about ada lovelace charles babbage the history of computers etc i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history it gives the impression that its writer lynn hershman leeson has no real understanding of the math technology or history constituting the film's subject but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them this hits a sore spot with me as i've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion eg emmy coer information waves have a half life ada i'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all br br this movie does worse than fail to entertain it misinforms the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts it's more likely i think to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic
