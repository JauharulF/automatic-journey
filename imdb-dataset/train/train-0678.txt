<START> this movie shows how savage the troubles really are people who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered this movie shows how the people of northern ireland both catholic and protestant are held captive at any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not
<START> 1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in hollywood history with more classic films released than in any other and john ford directed three of the best stagecoach drums along the mohawk and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the union young mr lincoln br br with the world plunging into a war that america dreaded but knew it would be drawn into abraham lincoln was much on people's minds in 1939 as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life and had triumphed on broadway robert e sherwood's award winning abe lincoln in illinois with raymond massey's physically dead on portrayal was playing to packed houses it would be filmed in 1940 carl sandburg's continuation of his epic biography abraham lincoln the war years was published and quickly became a best seller president roosevelt frequently referred to lincoln in speeches and the lincoln memorial in washington d c became the most popular landmark in town a fact that frank capra made good use of in mr smith goes to washington br br all this was not lost on darryl f zanuck at 20th century fox as soon as he read lamar trotti's screenplay of lincoln's early days as a lawyer he designated it a 'prestige' production and assigned john ford to direct and henry fonda to star br br fonda did not want to play lincoln he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'great emancipator' and feared a bad performance would damage his career even a filmed make up test in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble lincoln wouldn't change his mind according to fonda john ford whom he'd never worked with cussed him out royally at their first meeting and explained he wasn't portraying the lincoln of legend but a young jackanape country lawyer facing his first murder trial humbled fonda took the role john ford offered a different scenario of the events but the outcome was the same obviously they found a chemistry together that worked as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics' br br unlike the introverted melancholia racked lincoln of abe lincoln in illinois ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney who made friends easily and misses the mother he lost too young resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story injustice riles him and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence interlaced with doses of humor both productions play on lincoln's undocumented relationship with ann rutledge in ford's version the pair are truly in love and committed to each other after her death lincoln would frequently visit her grave to share his life with her 'spirit' a theme ford would continue in she wore a yellow ribbon br br a murder trial is the centerpiece of the film and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director fonda deftly portrays lincoln's inexperience yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy and ford emphasizes the gulf between the big city 'intellectuals' represented by pompous d a donald meek and his slick 'advisor' stephen douglas played by a young milburn stone and the informal rule bending country sense of lincoln with ford 'regular' ward bond as a key witness the trial is both unconventional and riveting br br with the film closing as lincoln strides away into the stormy distance and his destiny dissolving into a view of the statue at the lincoln memorial audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just good would ultimately triumph br br young mr lincoln is a truly remarkable film from an amazing year
<START> the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher casper van dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant now there's something you don't see everyday matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for reasons i'm unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up take over the world for the fallen one or something like that it's up to matt to save the day the whole planet br br written directed by kevin vanhook who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film it's as simple straight forward as that there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical conceptual level the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live the character's are awful as clichÃ©d as you like the dialogue is bad as in very very bad the entire film is predictable i mean it's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it it's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state this is bad very bad you have been warned br br director vanhook doesn't impress the fight scenes are absolutely awful why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple they look naff to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour there are also some normal sized mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy 1999 unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect in fact are wasted as some comic relief the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is forget about any scares tension or atmosphere don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any br br technically the fallen ones isn't anything special apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there's little her to get excited about the ghost cgi water effects are terrible it was made for tv it's shows the acting was poor wagner looks embarrassed this is probably the only thing the likes of dien bosley can get these days br br the fallen ones is a bad film there's no two ways about it as far as i'm concerned not recommended on any level or in any way one to avoid
<START> shame shame shame on ua dw for what you do br br i was appalled br br do not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed certainly we all have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations but this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his thumbs up at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic br br what a pity br br spend your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program this movie is not worth a free ticket viewing br br stick with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money seriously save your money it will be on cable by saint patty's day br br shame shame shame on what they do
<START> this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely family type entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid western town of big bean illinois where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement pre invasion of the decade is the new and only exit ramp from the interstate the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being well equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on eradicating the martians too the martians dead pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thought provoking it isn't but subtle and enjoyable it is
<START> red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger wes craven wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa after attending the funeral of her grandmother she decides to take the red eye flight during waiting she meets this man named jack rippner how fffrreeaakkyy is that and they sort of become friends ironically both sit right next to each other on this plane then this is when the horror starts this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling horror films well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production wes craven did well with this film he chose the right actors like rachel mcadams an intelligent sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious of everything when she's acting in a film cillian murphy the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film and his face can really widen your eyes wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one
<START> if you like animal movies this movie will please my wife likes animals and animal movies she especially like the parrot in this film it is geared towards kids but i laughed at most of the humor the french fashion character made me laugh and adds balance to the script it is a disney film with its sappy happily family apeal but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing
<START> really a terrible movie it's to be expected though clearly a low budget nothing all that innovative an actress if you can call what she does acting who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator a cabin in the woods etc but there are some redeeming points although the story is not new for the most part there's a few parts that aren't so regurgitated for one the black guy doesn't die when he's attacked the first time and he isn't even one of the first couple to die but that's minor more importantly there's a very interesting twist regarding kat's experiments and wes steve that i didn't see coming when steve told kat he knew what she did i believed what he said and what kat replied with but when the creature revealed who he really was i was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation it could be because of my lack of experience with the genre or that it's a genuinely clever twist br br either way the movie's pretty bad and don't watch it if there's anything better on unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick
<START> your attitude going into prom night ii will determine how much joy you take away from the film if you're expecting a horror masterpiece look elsewhere if you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold you'll like this lisa schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top mary lou and wendy loyd channels schrage's rage perfectly during her time possessed br br not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending br br
<START> white fire has so much going for it with larry bird look alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache the movie soars above other low budget actioners the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz with ginty beating up everyone the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play then add in fred williamson some frontal bush chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders if you're looking for some awesome b action this is where it's at now if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack
<START> the sword fighting was out of this world the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques until the end that are way too common today the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were clichÃ© but the movie is comfortable with it an injection of humour from woo br br the plot with it's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on br br a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung fu flicks don't
<START> the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie's story and re creations of the klaw short films while the klaw re creations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stage y but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
<START> dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film the way it is shot lit acted etc just doesn't make sense it's all so bad it is difficult to watch loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom there seems to be no 'normal' person in the entire film and the existence of the 'outside world' is well it just doesn't exist and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden this film is beyond stupidity zero
<START> alien love as this movie is known in britain is a very strange movie i don t mean that it s an esoteric art house movie in the style of peter greenaway or derek jarman i mean it s a tvm with swearing sex some really good t a a bad script and a very retro feel you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier though of course he would have cut out the t a br br going back to the bad script one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda why does she pick up connie at the bar just so she could meet an alien do you see what i mean about retro et short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here the storyline continues to follow an ill defined unconvincing and illogical path br br that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the t a on display as a a sci fi sex comedy it s much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
<START> i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie there's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king 1 1 2 except its different stories all told by the mice the reason i'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
<START> last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride she finds tarzan and jane who try to protect her george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn't used to his full advantage also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often even the great robert florey can't aid this one br br 1 2 of four
<START> this is easily the worst presley vehicle ever which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made it is measurably worse than even the revolting happy ending song at the end of it happened at the world's fair and here i thought that moment when elvis buys all of the vendor's balloons for his girl and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped i usually enjoy the random elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it this one however ought to be called live a little wish you were dead a little and makes stay away joe look like olivier playing othello br br here elvis plays greg who is essentially a hippie free lance photographer except for the establishment haircut after a fun morning of reckless driving he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her clearly michele carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic elizabeth taylor if i watched this without my glasses i would have thought it was late 1960's liz playing the female lead she sics her dog on elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him the audience does not know about it either until elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house br br rather than having her arrested for kidnapping larceny and assault he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent miss crazy pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings job one is working for don porter at a playboy type magazine job two is upstairs working for rudy vallee at a snobby fashion magazine i think the two job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy too bad it isn't the least bit funny unless you'd laugh the 100th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast motion to silly music the predominate obstacle that keeps greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest the dreadfully miscast dick sargent let's face it either porter or vallee even given their advanced ages in 1968 would have made far more believable competitors for miss crazy's affections br br there are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns i kept waiting for something anything to happen that would make all of this make sense it never did entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of elvis' rendition of a little less talk which i can listen to on cd without this painful movie inflicted upon me and a funny five second bit where elvis flops on the couch and crazy pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it that's it folks busted furniture the only laugh in this entire film no amount of mod sixties clothing music or dÃ©cor can salvage this high heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self infliction of grave bodily harm
<START> far from providing the caffeine kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy boosting of warm beverages coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale indeed if the movie was a cup of coffee it'd be rather weak and watery littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste sporadically it hits the spot but otherwise it isn't the hot action drama it hopes to be br br plot wise coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug pushing lady pimpin' mob suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved sick state socio political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy and it makes for some thought provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro american minorities sadly the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus coffy's ideas are important it's just that they are not well aimed br br one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence how do you deal with a house full of hoods drive the car right through the front door it's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible the low budget can't have helped but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick coffy lacks groove just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection br br the total result is workmanlike and wooden we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie it's a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze it just never ascends above being an average lukewarm number
<START> it was a good story but not very well told i liked the themes and the main story line which wasn't as clear as it could have been maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in the acting was okay to cheesy some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad i only just finished watching it and i'm glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end again a good story but the delivery was sub par would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy and i do mean a little
