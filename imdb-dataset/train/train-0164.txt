<START> the clouded yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye jean simmons is quite good and trevor howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero
<START> i recently started watching this show and i have to say that it really made me laugh you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it along with everything else some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead among other things if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch i absolutely love the narration i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones you have to take everything as it's own entity definitely give it a chance and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are
<START> 1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection Â mark sandrich's 'follow the fleet ' this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront cafÃ© where sherry martin rogers is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone's ear yep you guessed it Â they're hot for each other once again only this time sherry's spinster sister connie harriet hillard threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake's robust seafaring buddy bilge smith randolph scott a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic classy score including standards 'let yourself go' 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance ' the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger br br the transfer on 'follow the fleet' is a tad weaker the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it's a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles grain is still present so are age related artifacts once you've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage the audio is mono but very nicely balanced extras include a featurette theatrical trailer and short subject but oddly Â no audio commentary considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video
<START> it's a strange yet somehow impressive story about love personnaly i never run over such a twist off story in real life but i can image there is br br it's a story that promises to be sick from the title but after i watch it i didn't get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules it's something beautiful in this movie something impressive which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rules br br the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex you can see how this relation starts evolves and finally ends you feel the moment when this love blossoms the first whispers touchings you feel the connection and no moment i though this is immoral you even hope it will not break in the end it cannot break it's not right you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end br br but i need also to add a negative spin to this comment i don't know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content you don't have the total story but only fragments when movie has started the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place so no clue about the nature of the relation you feel only a tension between them a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stop and if you love me you will do as i ask you br br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral and where's the limit between them i don't know if the idea of this movie is love conquers all even social and moral standards or love is beautiful no matter how or where but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think
<START> this film is a spicy little piece of film making from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful candy's jean peters pocket on a crowded bus it turns out candy was doing a favor for her ex boyfriend who's working for the commies br br superficially there's a mystery here regarding candy's motives and skip spends much of the film determining her motivesÂ actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a commie going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture but the real question is Â what's going on with skip what are his motives and why does candy like him so much why do we the audience want to like him so much basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking male fatale in widmark's character and his performance just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like the big sleep or the glass key along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face the film makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers widmark is handsome and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance Â but the first two times he meets our leading lady he robs her and then punches her in the face eventually the question becomes Â would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police like you're waving a flag at me make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe thelma ritter i'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way br br thelma ritter's character work deserves special mention Â she has created a truly indelible character here fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of business Â in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world particularly her used ties another example of fuller's business would be the scene with victor perry an actor i've seen elsewhere used to less effect using the chopsticks to intimidate candy br br the emphasis on moe's relationship with skip provides one of cinema's most revealing honor among thieves themes in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police with the notable exception of capt tiger murvyn vye who has a grudge against him i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack those are the kind of details that make this film feel real Â whether or not it really is realistic or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions br br all told i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the film noir school of film making a predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters uniformly well performed cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is this is the best film i've seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director Â here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like the crimson kimono and shock corridor as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that i've seen so far Â and widmark was a talent that i'm tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films i've seen with him was comparable to that of alan ladd or humphrey bogart although arguably he didn't make as many classic films
<START> given how corny these movies are you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them the movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there the inhabitants were author charles hillyer denholm elliott with hair who gets haunted by one of his own creations philip grayson peter cushing who gets a little too close to a wax statue john reid christopher lee whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade and actor paul henderson jon pertwee on the verge of getting a little too much into character br br the house that dripped blood is actually worth seeing well duh it stars peter cushing and christopher lee aside from just being neat there might be some undertones it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs assumed horror like in the shining we might ask whether the house hotel itself holds some memory of past events and if absolutely nothing else ingrid pitt as paul's co star is hot hot hot around the time that this came out she also starred in countess dracula and the vampire lovers also with peter cushing maybe she like barbara steele will remain known only as a scream queen but mark my words she is a hot scream queen i'd like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co star in something br br i guess that the only weird scene so to speak is where denholm elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket you read that right what kind of a name is denholm anyway oh well a very cool movie
<START> in 1996's 101 dalmatians cruella de vil was arrested by the london metropolitain police god bless them for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies dalmatians all covered in mud and hay she spent the next 4 years in the tin can now 4 years later she unfortunately was released from the jail i say that's about 28 years in dog years br br so in 2000 disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed 102 dalmatians in it there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family oddball is the name i think i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently and the puppy had no spots also while cruella again played by glenn close has escaped again she wanted a bigger better coat made once again out of the puppies br br i especially liked the theme song i'm sure everybody loves the atomic dog song from the 70s or so and now we hear a bit of it in this movie br br 102 dalmatians is such a great film that i keep on wondering when will there be a 103 dalmatians lol br br 10 stars
<START> okay so i get it we're supposed to be horrified the idea has been planted a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it call me over the shock rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this but don't expect me to watch a soft porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father' i mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape and molestation' porn horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing it is what actually exists in film this is where miike fails in visitor q extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure
<START> peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth of its' pertinence will be the only thing that varies it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play
<START> it's telling that as of the entry of this comment no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie not surprisingly cheesy science fiction doesn't appeal to them quite as much if you like a good b movie and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch you will like this if you don't have fun watching bad movies this one's not for you
<START> going into a movie like i this i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills what i got was even less br br christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit horrified he runs up the stairs and cuts himself the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe cept for the fact he's obsessed with santa after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane dressing up like santa and starts killing non santa believing patrons and his boss an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him he drives his van off a cliff into the moon not the best ending i've seen but it was original br br it was a slow paced boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers there was hardly any gore and even the sex scenes were toned down br br too boring 4 out of 10
<START> prc which was the lowest of the low actually struck gold with this moody little thriller they did the same thing a year earlier with detour which is probably one of the finest low budget films ever made br br strangler is basically a one set film filled with mist and shadows a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets or lack thereof but here it works well the ghost of charles middleton better known as ming the merciless lurches around the swamp killing those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer his final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well br br rosemary laplanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style she offers herself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the killing but as a sop to the audience the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter somewhat chastened if ulmer who directed detour has directed strangler she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the strangler's job would be done but who's complaining it's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets lighting and the general moodiness of the piece it stands right behind detour as prc's finest hour
<START> this seemed to be a good movie i thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director's intention this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most br br another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo typing of the american characters they all seem to be carved out of the same block seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie br br these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story
<START> dan the widowed father of three girls has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication after his wife's death he has taken time to raise his daughters having known no romance in quite some time nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant marie at a local book store in a rhode island small town on the ocean where he has gone to celebrate thanksgiving with the rest of his big family after liking marie at first sight little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound after all she is the date of dan's brother mitch br br it is clear from the outset that dan and marie are made for one another and although we sense what the outcome will be we go for the fun ride that peter hedges the director wants to give us mr hedges an author and screenplay writer on his own has given us two excellent novels what's eating gilber grapes and an ocean in iowa and the delightful indie pieces of april which he also directed it's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during thanksgiving reunions br br the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars steve carell and juliette binoche mr carell in fact keeps getting better all the time in many ways he remind us of jack lemmon in his take of comedy and serious material what can one say about ms binoche an intelligent actress and a bright presence in any film she proves she is right up to doing comedy convincing us about her marie br br the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture john mahoney diane wiest norbert leo butz jessica hecht emily blunt allison pill amy ryan have nothing to do they just serve as incidental music for decoration dane cook who is seen as brother mitch fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others br br dan in real life is a delightful film that will please everyone
<START> the neil simon's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clark matthau and al lewis burns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questionsÂ the neil simon's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu nomination academy award as best actor and george burns won the academy award as best support actor the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report love heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life my rate is 7
<START> what a fun b movie shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never once takes itself seriously from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow this is truly a b movie gem grab some refreshments snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films sure they're not for everybody but to each his own sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile
<START> irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this so so movie she should have gone out with a bang being the classy actress she was not in this unmemorable almost unknown film br br this lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit even her high pitched voice got a bit annoying in here rumor has it she was not happy with this film one can see why br br the story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom speaking of that i thought david nelson from the ozzie harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna he looked and sounded just like nelson br br overall so so at best and a sub par ending for a great actress
<START> it was released in france on dvd several years ago i wish it would be re released with english subtitles do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king he sets off to join the army and goes to war his love however is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her i won't spoil the end gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age a great loss to moviedom
<START> i don't see what everyone liked about this movie the set up was too long and talky and when it was done the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene after the film finally got cusack into the eponymous hotel room i had to wonder well what's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged the answer not much just john cusack having a long drawn out mental breakdown br br maybe if the cusack character had more depth maybe if his freak out were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life maybe if the film had either better developed its half baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill ride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles i dunno all i do know is that i saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us much liked it br br except for the disquieting episode on the hotel ledge the alarming crazy lady with the hammer and the so stupid it was fun crypt keeper in the air duct all three of which account for no more than five minutes of screen time this film was a bore br br by the way this story seems to steal ideas from the shining and use them here to much less powerful effect is stephen king now reduced to stealing ideas from himself
<START> was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a light hearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original light hearted banter but by now it's too late it's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because i'd never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
