<START> looking at some of the negative posts you really have to wonder what some people do for fun br br i was lucky enough to see the film during its all too brief theatrical run the audience laughed its heads off i'm watching a tape of it as i type and it's still dang funny br br it's also got a sweet side with unexpected turns of genuine pathos the late great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely down on his luck farmer wrenchmuller ariana richards and j j anderson are great as the lead kids and the actors in the martian suits although limited to mime do a great job br br another thing to look for is the background details the film is full of homages pastiches and references to other sf and fantasy films take a look at the martian costumes next time one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume another is a ghostbuster a third is in a house atreides uniform and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit
<START> i think it's a great movie because you get to see how diana's life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because it's alright between diana and adrian but you don't get to see how it is at home and i didn't really like it that you also don't get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think i'm going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you don't like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it
<START> you can't exactly shove her out of the way because she's old and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault nevertheless in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake so it is with the pallbearer an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral br br to further extend the metaphor perhaps unwisely like the old lady one starts to feel with the set up of the film that its demise cannot be far away sure enough this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction downhill its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off again not unlike the grim inevitability of death br br returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels' the main character tom is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life if there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic' then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of schwimmer's other more famous role to find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even more 'clueless' than ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as schwimmer but i guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place br br how will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable' even if the situations aren't a man with a longstanding high school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years sound familiar paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'rachel' role but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present weren't so incongruous as well unfortunately the romantic element is so well worn it's threadbare and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff' 2 10
<START> i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i did not get scared even once while watching it it also is not very suspenseful either i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so what's left br br the ring is a trully scary movie i wish other movies would stop copying from it e g the trade mark long hair please give me some originality br br will not recommend this movie
<START> it's funny how your life can change in a second to attend ''the waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on br br eric stoltz's performances and mainly of helen hunt oh man helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth are wonderful wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted enjoy each moment of your life br br really to a film as that the any hour is not attended sorry it's a brazilian expression
<START> i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and i'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery it's about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie josie lawrence and lady caroline polly walker
<START> never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film i found it unbelievable lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't the acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any genre it didn't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters
<START> growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there this move brought back so many pleasant memories this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies
<START> minor spoilers br br i am like many others a huge jerry bruckheimer fan so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front and the trailer coming by before mi 2 expectations were rising a jerry bruckheimer production big cars nic cage and fresh from an oscar angelina jolie what can possibly go wrong a lot br br the script is neither funny which it tries really hard to be nor exciting you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and wooh haa you've got comedy i don't think so excitement is totally out of the picture first of all and this is probably said many times there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days next thing you know is that kip the brother is walking with nic in the streets again is this excitement think not then comes the best bit the romance between nic and angelina she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic 'do you have a girlfriend ' 'are you seeing anybody ' 'what went wrong ' etc br br then there's only one sparkle of hope left the car chases they're disappointing to say the least because the trailer made it look like it was full of them and there's only one a very long one caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement i really had trouble following the action br br so is it an action movie a thriller a romantic comedy there's no need to decide just avoid this horrible mess i'll give 3 out of 10 stars and i feel like i'm being generous
<START> omar epps is an outstanding actor i really think he gets into his character alot when deja gets shot he shows true emotion he also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room omar is a very talented actor
<START> i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie it was an epic of adolescence a dream of summers gone a great potential indie film or big budget drama it somehow got into the hands of a hack who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags i feel sorry for the actors since the characters in the book were rich and textured but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film mason gamble is great when given the opportunity as is dylan baker but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special poor people good rich people bad br br though it's almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware br br it's a good book but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe br br k
<START> a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining ignoring it is based on a true story or ranting against a film that glorifies che which it really doesn't this film is very close to jon anderson's definitive bio on che and gets the story right soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was che's bolivian adventure you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to che's revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened so don't go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up its a true story
<START> i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them weren't bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goody two shoes movies like these rarely get praise br br nonetheless i can't defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is cornier than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour and a half br br the story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some dÃ©butante from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more social conscious in the old days you'd hear the term social climber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life it's all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so today br br however it's about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andy's heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this
<START> elisha cuthbert plays sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty br br i was clicking through the channels and found this i read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha cuthbert i thought okay and watched the movie i didn't realise elisha had done films before 'the girl next door and 24' elisha provides a satisfactory performance the plot is a little cheesy but the film works its amazing how this young girl went on to become the hottest babe in hollywood
<START> before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn't discriminate spew hatred filled rants on tv or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic conservitive bible thumping fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn't give us any work and we against many of us's will watched 700's club and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he's right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host duct tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic
<START> the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament i didn't know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over 1 000 years this is one of them br br we are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle abbot cellach voiced by brendan gleeson abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore he fears the northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground br br one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland it is brother aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him aidan has special plans for brendan first he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence br br in the forest brendan meets ashley the protector of the forest she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than vikings out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion br br i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense i'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages much like the opening frames of disney's the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other br br i couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest 2d animation i have seen in years it's vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the film br br the story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only 75 minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesn't give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book we are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation br br i guess that's okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed
<START> let me tell you something about this movie i have seen it twice the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me i really liked it i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool br br i saw it again a few days ago it was horrible really i don't know why i thought it was funny before but now i didn't laugh at all there was nothing even slightly entertaining it was just dumb the story was weak the acting was nothing special there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best br br what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist really don't get me wrong usually i don't complain about racism in movies however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'the shaolin temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'the street fighter' is one of the bad guys or whatever you get the point there are people seeing racism everywhere i wonder how would they react to a movie like 'the meteor man' why i will tell you why there are no asians in this movie there are no white people among the good guys in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys all the good guys are african americans don't get me wrong i don't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen it is just not realistic if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with 'the street fighter' there is no problem in japan most of the people are asians but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem in usa most of the people are white it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy just not real br br that is it i am giving the movie the rate of 4 10 it would be 1 10 if i hadn't have fun with it as a kid
<START> saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars only wish i could find it again would certainly buy view it if i could please somebody bring it back fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii and his leading ladies joan leslie and especially june haver were beautiful and charming it was a musical but also romantic funny and clever this was my favorite movie starring june haver although i always liked her her dazzling smile lit up the screen and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles a well balanced and light hearted film only wish we had more like it
<START> normally i wouldn't feel qualified to review something i only saw a half hour of but i'll make an exception for this one br br let the dialogue speak for itself here's some of the bad guy's lines i smell teacher sorry teacher you get an 'f ' br br bad guy and bad girl right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs they're getting hot and heavy br br him so how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders br br her purrs you sure know how to show a girl a good time one generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone gets to sum up his life and personality in this line i am a chicken twit this was the usa network version my old man was right no wonder he left us boo hoo br br not actually a spoiler bad guy on fire screams aargh fire
<START> did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can't believe i signed the contract it's not the worst movie i ever saw but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn't move with vaughn's con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into
