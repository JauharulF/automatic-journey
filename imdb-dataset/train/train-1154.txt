<START> now i'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say hmm this isn't so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really didn't start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film and i use that term sparingly was i even close to being mildly entertained to start shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting i hate rap music but as far as i could tell an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him the main character is simply annoying and not a character that it's easy to like quite frankly i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus' bloody sores than watch this again
<START> mind my friends and i saw the movie based off it's title alone it's cute though obvious in it's plot and direction you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes my main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters an alcoholic father overworked mother stressed out sister that's a bad family but aside from the occasional mention from the sister there's not any resolution i was also confused as to the scene with the bottles it seemed pretty random br br the writing is a secondary concern the kids weren't bad actors but their script left a lot to be desired unfortunately what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single blah special effect lame scripting and a glaringly obvious plot
<START> the actors did a really good job playing their roles particularly the mom however as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people and at times i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands off approach to parenting displayed again and again the daughter is a 17 year old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette complete with lots of booty shaking the son is a guy with low self esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends so much that he throws a drug party late in the film the husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay oops i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks i think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system however given that these characters are not typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous
<START> absence of a good plot absence of decent acting absence of good cinematography absence of decent looking special effects need i go on review may contain spoilers the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that most of the actors were acting like they were in a second grade play the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders it's not really all that convoluted it's just so simple and dumb that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted nope it's not it's exactly as simple as you think it is i understood the film that's how i know that it stunk most of the film just had people sitting around talking reading their lines trying to look sinister the narrator was annoying the special effects were laughable i love low budget movies i also like carolyn munro tom savini jack scarry and michael berrymore just not in this movie you can tell they weren't getting paid or weren't getting paid much because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it i love tony todd however he was only adequate in this movie in fact tony todd's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes seriously i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment if i had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this film i would have been p o 'd and demanded my money back hopefully the people who made this will do better next time
<START> i confess emma in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here br br unfortunately this is at best a palimpsest br br comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch br br there are some good elements here kate berkinsale having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm clearly emma's smarter spiritual twin is a wonderful emma raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill the production is handsome but the interiors are far too dark br br however there are several major problems the first is mark strong first of all he doesn't look right for mr knightley this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson it's badly out of tune br br the second problem is one of length simply put the film is much too short to get the right kind of feel it would need to be twice as long br br finally and most significantly there is the quality of the adaptation austen is an adapter's dream all the dialogue is there already it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly andrew davies seems to think otherwise first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy more significantly davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast what planet or minor work of thomas hardy is this come from it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon perfection br br watch the paltrow version or watch kate in cold comfort farm
<START> what fun bucketfuls of good humor terrific cast chemistry skelton powell lahr o'brien dynamite dorsey driven soundtrack miss powell's dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz her most winning film appearance
<START> 'i'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and i'm starting to get confused about who i really am sh t i've got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fast cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images ' br br i rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable ending br br an eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran video br br it's painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow br br cool blue moodiness served up with po faced seriousness disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent sci fi this is the plot of a computer game
<START> horrible acting bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg i have never seen a worse movie in my life 5 minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen it didn't aside from a nice breast shot the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 of the sets you even see this same red chair in several different locations if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog note to producers renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee you will be demanding your money back i only spent 2 99 to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off
<START> this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great if you're a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you don't laugh while seen this movie you don't have any sense of humor
<START> antwone fisher tells of a young black u s navy enlisted man and product of childhood abuse and neglect luke whose hostility toward others gets him a stint with the base shrink washington leading to introspection self appraisal and a return to his roots pat sanitized and sentimental antwone fisher is a solid feel good flick about the reconciliation of past regrets and closure good old hollywood style entertainment family values entertainment with just a hint of corn b
<START> i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well br br 7 10 overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out
<START> simple minded but good natured drive in movie about a simple minded but good natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his ballroom br br bobby our hero spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor but he finds out much responsibility danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel br br the van is a guilty pleasure of mine it captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad it's good category
<START> and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches br br i'm 27 and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations like the main character in the film i was successful mainly because of logic because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasn't in the end i was really successful because of medication by the way but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't br br so i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud not only does it cheat with the main character's story who wasn't faithful to his wife who was bisexual something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia which is entirely missing the point br br schizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease a schizophrenic isn't a normal man with a disease it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people for him things like time space and people's personalities aren't solid things he feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear to cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people don't expect but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead end br br this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous cure tear jerking movie it should be violently frightening people other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in lynch's eraserhead for example there should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because that's what schizophrenia is all about it's not about details br br i mean watch naked lunch lost highway read p k dick's martian time split or ubik do watch the cell perfect blue dark city or play american mcgee's alice on pc and you may have a vague idea of what it's like don't watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks the cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind his visions and his inner consistency it's violent weird confusing and very very scary br br once again schizophrenia isn't about details it's not a neat tame trick played to you it jumps in your face and won't let you go walls fall apart people turn into strange hostile creatures you feel like you go backward in time you're not sure you're who you think you are everything feels strange unnatural believe me this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap like melodrama
<START> what is this is it a comedy a horror movie or just nothing this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf that must be the worst scene that has ever been made this movie isn't funny it isn't scary and not entertaining at all please do yourself and me i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie a favour and don't watch this movie if you get is a present just throw it away and chop it in to pieces
<START> if anybody really wants to understand hitler read wwi history not wwii history find out what happened during that war how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time how so many soldiers went insane from what they saw during wwi at the time they called it shellshocked now the call it post traumatic stress disorder if you learn the true horrors of wwi you will begin to understand hitler you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them br br this movie unfortunately misses that as so many others do read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie paths of glory the only good wwi movie ever made you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie the sense of helplessness and a utter devaluation of human life as nothing more than bullet catchers br br thats what this movie misses its really the key point to understanding germany a lost war where millions and millions of germans lost their lives for no real reason then comes an utter economic collapse following the war those are the factors that create extremism br br the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism unfortunately this movie ignored these factors and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile with really no real value there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more
<START> one of the most peculiar oft used romance movie plots is this one a seriously messed up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently it's done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you're telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks aren't affected one bit and since this is the 70's neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and they're played by actors who are completely at sea br br this has got to be the worst performance of al pacino's career and i say that after having seen the devil's advocate only two days ago he plays a control freak emotionally constipated race car driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why he's staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that he's changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies br br marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable she's supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesn't work that way it's more like she's harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you can't believe she'd be with someone she finds so worthless and you can't believe he's with someone who gets on his nerves that much br br some bad movie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacino's silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if you're a serious bad movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacino's other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isn't one of those laugh a minute bad movies like the conqueror it's just a really really bad movie br br
<START> wow br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 1 98 at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didn't have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is br br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990 br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how god awful it really is
<START> we've all been there sitting with some friends watching a bad movie laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says how is it possible such a movie was made who paid money to have this script made into a feature film well jigsaw is not that kind of film instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun yes jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived this coming from a guy who has seen campfire stories and fever lake the film starts out in some kind of college class what kind of class i am unsure but it is imagined to be an art class now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free a good for her a week passes and the five students plus teacher plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project they put the pieces together head arms legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage one puts a saw blade in the left hand the other gets a sawed off shotgun the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye ala hellraiser 3 with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo hawk after they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin now aptly named jigsaw now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair bad acting dialog and everything else but has still been pretty plausible yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst jigsaw comes alive how you ask i have no idea he just does because the writers couldn't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive come on guys a bolt of lighting a traveling voodoo priest anything could have worked so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc first he kills the cool guy with some barb wire this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself no well its not important they don't even show his macabre creation they don't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece since he is still uninterested in that torso thing so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn't even plugged in that is where the freaking movie ends we don't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned this movie is so shameful it has too be seen it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day for the memories of a lifetime jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw thank you total recall the judge has ruled watch jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out
<START> this film is notable for three reasons br br first apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'superman' serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters marking george reeves' and phyllis coates' initial appearances as clark kent superman and lois lane part of the opening is re used in the series outside the town of silby a six mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow earth' allowing the 'mole men' to come to the surface forget about the other holes those in the plot br br second unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a dominant and controlling force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes no 'mild mannered reporter' here clark kent knowledgeable and self assertive grabs control of the situation throughout i'll handle this even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole man as superman he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as nazi storm troopers br br third you will notice that the transition from the fleisher like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'adventures of superman' had not yet been made
<START> essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush jungles of ceylon and the presence of elizabeth taylor but the film really never gets going newlwed taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman played by dana andrews the plantation is under the spell of owner peter finch's late father whose ghost casts a pall over elephant walk that becomes a major point of contention between taylor and finch the elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right of way the beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture taylor and andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with finch
