<START> ram gopal verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director he had done a remake reworking of godfather with sarkar and succeeded tremendously ditto for lolita which he made as nishaabd br br sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most unfortunately he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake br br the acting ranged from decent to very good with amitabh bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain babban br br the songs were awful and forgettable the mehbooba mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video br br the worst part was the pacing and the dialogues which were forgettable br br watching the movie in a theatre i found myself waiting for the intermission and then for the ending some viewers were wise not to wait and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film ultimately one of the worst movies made by ram gopal verma
<START> let's be honest shall we al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus it's a hook make no mistake al gore is a politician three years ago he was busted ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid a yugo or even a gm metro but a lincoln go google it if you like or how about the fact that mr gore his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel guzzling jets to attend the premiers of an inconvenient truth so much for conservation huh al anyway it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at an inconvenient truth discover the main fundamental flaw while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed global warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it for example i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot they can point out an automobile which is not running right but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why generally not a second flaw just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago the toilet wasn't even invented yet what did they have a june bug in a match box hell even 50 60 years ago therefore how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best or that man is the sole cause of it the answer is we don't science is never a consensus thirty years ago time magazine did a cover proclaiming a new ice age the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions solar activity el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed global warming finally what al gore fails to adequately address is even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al implement everything he recommends how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism answer it's wishful thinking mr gore you being a former vp of the usa know it if the folks who produced an inconvenient truth were really honest they would have titled their film al gore wants attention but what i'd really like is for someone to ask the former vp this why were two of the planet's biggest polluters aka china india exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords anyway i hear the producers of a i t are working on their next film entitled gnomes fairies elves our endangered friends
<START> midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice over of the main character joe buck jon voight singing in the shower he is singing a cowboy song the very thing he strives to be joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women and even more money he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy but in a cartoonish fashion not even his friends take him seriously he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers this is primarily a story of joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world br br he starts off as a very naÃ¯ve southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks he has no other reason to think otherwise as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance as they are they are coming out of his past however as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past which is no longer whimsical but gritty filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted and her being raped in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart the naivetÃ© that he once carried is falling off of him he and ratso dustin hoffman are living in squalor and barely able to get food to eat joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didn't envision his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out br br ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe but in an opposite way ratso is joe's foil joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good outward appearance ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite he is short dark and always coated with a sheen of sweat he understands how the world works that it is unforgiving and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did they are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different level br br the theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider ratso living in the cold of nyc wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from ratso's perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an outsider alienated from society br br it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation he dresses ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no avail upon ratso's death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film despite the ratso's death and joe's continued alienation the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman
<START> not one of your harder hitting stories and that's a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all too predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disney ish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed fun br br btw if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi we followed her directions and it was brilliant next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out
<START> this must be accompanied by a special rating and warning not recommended to normal people br br the obsession of daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare also it's evident that the man is a misanthrope he hates everybody his country his people his actors his job and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago br br this so called film is just a hideous string of disgusting images with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge it is an insult to good taste and to good sense shame shame shame
<START> the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon 'sky captain' jude law's base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now let's combine 1920's german expressionism and a 1940's globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene wow won't that be a success skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess there are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two dimensional after all why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three or five or one hundred moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights everything seems to be just a little off i'm not being nit picky here in any way an infant could notice that a car doesn't glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a mercedes s500 and for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out 'this is a stylized film it's not supposed to be like reality' let me just say this lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating real life actors with cgi starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920's back into the hollywood film portfolio and tim burton's batman created a unique picture of new york city gotham that has yet to be repeated sky captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill so there you have it i spent 9 to see this film and you get my review i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did
<START> as is well known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this herr graf's silent rants during summertime aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well hordes of coarse people taking their ease such bizarre travels around the world also happen in three ages a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands namely herr buster keaton and herr eddie cline br br obviously this german count liked most the first segment focused on the stone age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time preferring that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of rome it should have included the cause of the fall of the roman empire that is to say barbarians or the same thing germans of course the third segment takes place during modern times but this teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern br br the leitmotiv that moves herr keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages is the search for love a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self interest every time that three ages is shown in the schloss theatre it is always a pleasure to watch a funny witty silent film even for a serious german count an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets puns pratfalls and acrobatics visual and astounding technical tricks an absolute silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse summertime severities br br and now if you'll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must flirt with an old teutonic heiress who doesn't look her age br br herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com
<START> this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing sandy and the agnes moorhead and the tiny spacemen episodes br br it is an important take from mid 1961 on the long cold war that the u s was then embroiled in the beaten down city scene the near starving characters' sparse dialog their threadbare uniforms and the minimal action says it all the absurdity of an on going conflict that threatens to destroy human life modern civilization and all that is sweet and redeeming about it br br it is a fable because it was made in a time in which had events turned out differently such as the second berlin crisis spring 1961 and the subsequent cuban missile crisis oct 1962 it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u s 's major cities ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors i also see it as a fable because it is not only a cautionary tale but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths it is a love story set in an impossible situation and involving two highly mismatched lovers
<START> steven seagal mr personality himself this time is the united states' greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor jannick mark bazeley john sands seagal will fly into enemy territory receiving help from his arab lover jessica ciera payton and a freedom fighter rojar alki david once they are on ground jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders stone vincenzo nicoli and his female enforcer eliana katie jones and sands must figure out how to not only re take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well and maybe sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained rather steve toussaint in the process sands has 72 hours until a general's navy pilots bomb the entire area on board the stealth black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb hoping to detonate it on the united states br br seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead the setting of afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny nor does how easily seagal and co are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about the movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes unlike the good old days one of seagal's poorest efforts and he's as understated as ever not a compliment even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains tis a shame he doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but it's not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close ups
<START> one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr blandings builds his dream house although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham br br what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft ellender wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business br br i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did br br of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up threatening to send cary to the cleaners cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel usually too late truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it br br myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does the film would still work just fine br br mr blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years
<START> as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as amc billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself mississip's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from and whenever he does deliver a line it's several decibels higher than any other cast member mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable country bumpkin goofball but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot mansfield looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex kitten and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray walston's character was sugary and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the tamest leave i've ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i won't spoil that for anyone i will tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary
<START> if i have to give this movie a score on a linear scale then i have to give it a low score 3 10 br br but it was entertaining and there are several good things to say about the movie br br the psychiatrist candidate james bishop is assigned to st andrews hospital for his resident and is exited and eager to change the world br br from the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth but james thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil br br the story builds fairly well you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil and wonder when and how james will discover this also when the break comes james is in a way hunted by the evil and you feel some suspense until the fight is over br br add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements and you get the picture br br the character buildup is actually fairly good you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed some of them you get to know br br the film sets an unpleasant scene this is also done fairly well there are mysteries that are unveiled in an acceptable way br br the main character james is very believable the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting br br what kills this movie is stupid special effects a modern version of plan 9 from outer space type bad the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow some bad acting or probably very few takes when filming the main characters sometimes acts badly and somtimes good the sound is at times very cheap br br i kept thinking i could make a movie like this with my home video camera throughout the film
<START> this flick reminds me some really bad science fiction movies from 50's and 60's it is not scary or interesting but it's dull cheesy and stupid special effects are laughable all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful don't waste your money rent or buy something better i give it 3 5 out of 10 i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity
<START> people tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people i don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people jaco van dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction daniel auteuil and pascal duquenne work perfectly together with duquenne basically playing himself the film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in rain man the ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come before br br 7 8 out of 10
<START> excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting br br maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already
<START> this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous br br sean crawley good looking chris l mckenna whom i've never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking he's getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who i've been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money br br up to this point it's a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film's writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10 day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie let's just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the f k baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it br br this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value it's supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome sean's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first one third of the movie
<START> i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing this movie has the worst acting since killjoy br br here is a brief outline of the plot the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach drooling over a skinny blonde haired beach hunk who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life somehow everyone knows him and every single chick in the movie wants him uh oh here comes the competition the stereotypical hot chick and her best friends who drive an ugly pink car we soon find out jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind oh no i think i'm gonna cry a huge storm comes and fills their swimming pool with nasty water somehow for no apparent reason the little chick falls into the pool and comes face to face with yup you guessed it a mermaid this is where the story really takes off basically they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the hunk br br this is a preteen flick with acting so bad it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of oscar worthy performances this movie has all the clichÃ©s possible the best friends the hunk who everyone wants the hot bad girl and her bitchy friends the scary old man you name it it's in there i took one for a lot of people by watching this consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you please don't see this movie don't make it so i suffered in vain
<START> this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget cameo type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the blonde bombshells' a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory son daughter who thinks she's gone potty i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don't have a monopoly on feelings love and even lust that the old wrinklies can have a good laugh too judi dench was superb as always a pity we didn't get to see more of the other blonde bombeshells the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm although he was quite adequate as the transvestite drummer all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls
<START> i can't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i laughed a couple of times probably because of how stupid it was if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn't the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldn't even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating f
<START> this movie is a mess but at least it's not pretentious the box art for the video markets it as a fun throwback to 1950s giant bug movies in reality it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of aliens br br the producers clearly wanted to make an alien picture but they mustn't have had much money in fact it doesn't look like they had any money really i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing br br the basic plot is retained group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons i presume instead of setting the film in space where no one can hear you scream they set the film in a hospital where everyone can see your budget laid bare the amusing thing about blue monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is the filmmakers didn't abandon the alien aesthetics even though we're in a hospital we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted in this case the venerable growth hormone plot device the annex also doubles as a boiler room or something so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi leveled steel catwalks perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats br br the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location he touches it and says ow so we know he's been hurt the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth i guess in an alien picture this would be called the mouthburster the worm is isolated but some naughty little kids leukemia patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth hormone you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi convincing insectoid arms the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi offscreen monster semi obscured by the semi darkness br br which brings us back to alien how you ask can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the alien movies no problem a power outage or something causes the electrical system to go awry which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less than special effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking they don't move too well and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy br br ok so what alien bases haven't we covered oh water dripping down the walls check we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts then send some of the characters through the damp drippy basement to get to the other side problem solved we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots and don't forget the fog well you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies do you ok maybe inside of a hospital you do so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark burn br br i haven't said anything about the negligible acting not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow i take it blue monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun and if so then it is a nice try but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag see a film called return of the aliens the deadly spawn if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right with even less money and even more marginal acting talent this one falls flat on its alien
