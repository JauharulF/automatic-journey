<START> during 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that lily powers barbara stanwyck would do anything to obtain great wealth and power lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on lily as the story progresses lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president it is great to see a very young john wayne jimmy mccoy jr who was only 25 when this picture was produced and jimmy did not even get to first base with lily not even for lunch a very young george brent coutland trenholm stars along with barbara stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by darryl f zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen this film is rather mild compared to what we view on the hollywood screens today but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film enjoy
<START> an italian american co production co starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat br br well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said 'very easily' thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material br br the hoff stars as gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie cumming to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity br br his plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks robert champagne and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan catherine hickland and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to inspect the island's hotel br br after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch hildegard knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate br br none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious manchester as tommy is particularly bad whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace jerry is crucified and burnt alive linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood and gary gets stabbed in the back br br oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again
<START> the late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings renny harlin's superbly gritty and moody prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior the chair john saxon's enjoyably trashy death house the passable psycho picture destroyer and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium br br your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp alex the hugely unappealing nicholas celozzi go to alcatraz island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up and coming rock star sammy mitchell blandly played by toni basil of hey micky fame alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic us civil war cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing wimpy alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter br br although slickly photographed by nicholas von sternberg with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty rundown ruins of alcatraz island slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid effective fright feature this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing the flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more with onetime playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme hope marie carlton doing an especially irritating linnea quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo dimitri logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy horrendously sophomoric silliness and most damagingly ted landon's sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far fetched story even remotely plausible in other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn out cinematic jail sentence
<START> if like me you like your films to be unique and unlike the majority of other movies then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast the film is a grotesque erotic fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women the film is very daring with it's subject material and that is something to give it credit for the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo and for good reason i might add but the film conveys it straight and to the point like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre the beast could have gone around it and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps but borowczyk didn't do that and he is brave in that respect especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms but the fact that he went ahead with it in my view means a big thumbs up for the guy br br the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience in some ways for the incredible tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking and are bound to offend many people hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer this film has a defining point as said during the film the only difference between man and beast is intelligence both man and beast have instincts only man knows how to control them the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast the film has strong themes of the age old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust but not without a moral br br many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring but these scenes are important to the film's story without these scenes we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast and most importantly the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience and as that is one of the key elements of the film it would be a real shame besides that borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes not with shocks but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either br br overall the beast is a shocking film it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone however if you can get over the film's shock and embrace the beast what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance
<START> this self indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr branagh's career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema released 4 years ago not a peep of an adaptation since i just finished watching this on cable holy god it's terrible br br i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill that being said i'll take the risk if only because love's labour's lost is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr branagh's directorial abilities in the past branagh has always been a pretty lousy director grindingly literal minded star struck unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors he loves his american stars but loves himself more making damn sure that he gets all the good lines br br along those lines the sad fact remains that love's labour's lost is scarcely worse than the interminable ghastly bloated hamlet from 1996 in fact this film may be preferable if only because it's about 1 3 the length branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeare's to the milieu of cole porter george gershwin fred astaire yada yada so he sets the thing in 1939 leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties' standards wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during i'm in heaven and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing himself included the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didn't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies i don't even blame the cast to paraphrase hamlet the screenplay's the thing no one could possibly come off well in this hodge podge the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone who could possibly act in this thing br br branagh's first mistake was in thinking that love's labour's lost was a play worth filming trust me it isn't it's an anomaly in the bard's canon written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers not the usual audience for which he wrote hence there's a lot of precious and tedious word play references to contemporary scholastic nonsense parodies of lyly's euphues in other words hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience hell it doesn't appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately updating it with any gimmick that comes to hand which begs the question why bother br br branagh's second mistake was in thinking that shakespeare's cream pie of a play could be served with a side order of gershwin's marmalade clearly the idea or hope was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time but again this begs the question why bother br br
<START> for all of the has beens or never was's or for the curious this film is for you ever played a sport or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left this film explores that and more br br robin williams jack dundee is a small town assistant banker in taft ca whose life has been plagued by a miscue in a big rival high school football game 13 years ago when he dropped the pass that would have won over bakersfield their arch rival that takes great pleasure in pounding the taft rockets season after season kurt russell reno hightower was the quarterback in that famous game and is the local legend that now is a van repair specialist whose life is fading into lethargy like the town of taft itself br br williams gets an idea to remake history by replaying the game he meets with skeptical resistance so he goes on a one man terror spree and literally paints the town orange yellow and black to raise the ire of the residents to recreate the game after succeeding the players from that 1972 team reunite and try to get in shape to practice which is hysterical the game is on bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets game strategies and sophisticated training routines taft is drawing plays in the mud with sticks stones and bottle caps what a riot does taft overcome the odds does robin willians purge the demons from his bowels does kurt russell rise from lethargy watch the best of times for one of the best viewing experiences ever br br one of robin williams best understated performances the chemistry between robin and russell is magic and who is kid lester br br holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performances as the wives of williams and russell succeeds on many levels a 10
<START> a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick up truck mirage is obviously inspired by spielberg's duel and craven's the hills have eyes still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk and slash sequences the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak but the film is fast paced and shocking b g steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look 8 out of 10
<START> revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features i'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 i suspect this isn't true it's not like iq's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today why just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to close up the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue i'm going to make some tea go outside read my book now are you yes i am that sort of exchange happens several times normally i would love that being a huge fan of bad movies but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away this sort of disinterested pot boiling time waster is far worse than energetic imaginative mind blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom which is far worse
<START> i found the documentary entitled fast cheap and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary the documentary contained four mini documentaries about four interesting men each one of these men was extremely involved with his job showing sheer love and enjoyment for one's job br br the sad part i must say would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked studied they were interesting for about five minutes afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long br br the video was filmed in a very creative way though i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music
<START> this was a quite brutal movie there were huge implausibilities and a silly script bad acting etc br br the only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed
<START> the film notes describe the main role family as turkish immigrants which living in denmark however it is so clear to understand that the fact is the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute kurdish similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on kurdish ethnicity societies what a worry br br it is widely accepted issue in turkey today the kurdish immigrants living in european countries today which have moved from turkey at 70's are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system by growing daughters and women under pressure are giving harm to the turkish international image also as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe nominee
<START> director spike lee is famous for making films pointing out racism in many of films such do the right thing most of the white people are all brutal racists in this movie interracial marriage is the subject with racism once again being the entire issue br br what lee does however is once again demonstrate his bigotry against christianity it's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world if lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified but christians hey it's open season on them br br ossie davis a reverend in this film shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his bible they zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it hey folks here's another bible reader and look what he''s like lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes br br he shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing however lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films his obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation it only adds fuel to the fire br br hey spike start doing the right thing and leave your prejudices in the closet better yet get over it br br this is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence
<START> this could be the most underrated movie of its genre i don't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office however frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list br br movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself god's hand and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case during that trip the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who one day claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission br br this is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat the tension runs high innocent people or demons get killed and religious experiences are questioned it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end if you like this genre i highly recommend frailty for you i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horror thrillers
<START> your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video not film the story is convoluted and the production is amazingly sloppy note for example that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in vermont where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees their ceremony in vermont takes place in a garden of tropical plants including palms which wouldn't last five minutes in the new england climate on yet another airplane trip the establishing shot depicts a fedex cargo plane taking off presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage as for the plot this movie expects you to believe that victor the devoutly christian brother of arthur is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay not only that but the pastor eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed to purge their souls of sin apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten commandments were it not for jamie brett gabel who is surprisingly effective as arthur this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all
<START> i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained
<START> miike makes a children's adventure film not unlike the neverending story it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miike's films it can tend to move very slowly that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse the story itself isn't very good either and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miike's most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different fantastical forms and the costume designers special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters spook warfare and the cheesy rubber suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state of the art makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case agi who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white beehive hairdo and a whip she's played incidentally by chiaki kuriyama whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill vol 1 the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle
<START> today bea arthur died so i was cruising around the imdb web site and somehow wound up on a show called gloria all in the family was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and i bet i watched every episode more than once however i swear that i did not know a show named gloria existed maybe that's a good thing maybe it means i had a life as a young adult rather than watching television br br on the other hand it is pathetic that the all in the family franchise had deteriorated so much that it begat a show i never heard of and one that is rated very poorly by the previous reviewers br br i rated the show a 1 for two reasons the system did not allow me to register a no vote and writers and tv execs should be condemned for starting a show that had no business being on the air and besmirches the memory of one of the greatest shows in tv history br br shalom zwrite
<START> the shining you know what's weird about this movie this is the movie that everyone for people who claim to not like horror films will always say that the shining is a terrific film this is stanley kubrick's classic vision of stephen king's horror tale of madness and blood this is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not you have heard of it know a few lines from it and know some of the classic images who could forget jack's here's johnny who could forget all work and no play make jack a dull boy who could forget that chilling ending this is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is kubrick's best work i know there is a lot of argument in that department a lot of people say it's 2001 a space odyssey or clockwork orange or even dr strangelove but if those film pioneered film making then the shining perfected it this is the tale of isolation madness terrifying images and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin br br jack torrance jack's son danny and jack's wife wendy arrive at the overlook hotel on closing day the elderly african american chef dick hallorann surprises danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream he explains to danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift they called the communication shining danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel particularly room 237 dick tells danny that the hotel has a certain shine to it and many memories not all of them good and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances danny's curiosity about room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after jack tells wendy that he loves his family seeing this wendy thinks jack has been abusing danny jack wanders into the hotel's gold room where he meets a ghostly bartender named lloyd danny starts calling out the word redrum frantically and scribbling it on walls he goes into a trance and withdraws he now says that he is tony his own imaginary friend jack sabotages the hotel radio cutting off communication from the outside world but hallorann has received danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way wendy discovers that jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating all work and no play makes jack a dull boy formatted in various ways horrified jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen jack converses with grady through the door of the locker which then unlocks releasing him danny has written redrum in lipstick on the door of wendy's bedroom when she looks in the mirror she sees that it is murder spelled backwards jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters here's johnny and jack's legendary image is born br br the shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares jack nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable but one i also feel is extremely overlooked is shelley duvall her scene of finding jack's rant all workÂ is incredible that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad also another incredible scene is when jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema the reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection it's been on the simpsons it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it trust me br br 10 10
<START> i q in my opinion is a sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you if you ask me james stephen fry really was a dull guy to me ed tim robbins was more suited for catherine meg ryan than james was anyway everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job now in conclusion i highly recommend this sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it you're in for lots of laughter so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> dark angel is a cross between huxley's brave new world and percy's love in the ruins portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by the pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters max the dark angel bike messenger and logan the rich rebel it seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming jessica alba who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive i think that fox has done it again
