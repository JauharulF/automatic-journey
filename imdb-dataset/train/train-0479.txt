<START> this movie is not only boring it is also really badly done the graphics are so bad they are not even second rate they are dreadful the characters do not show any facial expresssions the voice acting is empty and without any soul and the plot absolutely lacks well anything and everything my 5 year old likes it but thinks it's a bit boring i agree with him
<START> this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films basic instinct robocop and total recall among others he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve an annoying self centered writer with a morbid imagination gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea side town an hour or so from amsterdam verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard's imagination twists reality asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says 'boom' i read 'doom ' when it says 'flood' i read 'blood ' when it says 'red' i see 'dead ' when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it i lie the truth he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer a beautiful wealthy salon owner as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow ' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory i figured out is my favorite gender looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven's too and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality it's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that stuck
<START> rudyard kipling once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world but given that a human heart is very small in size every human has that special place that he loves more than any other it seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors the result is a wonderful collection of short films paris je t'aime in which our guides van sant coixet cuaron payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through parisian arrondissements human feelings yearnings and expectations br br always some other quarter always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love be it in a parking lot art studio tube station and paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves love for one's partner child parent for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around love that needs rekindling serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet or love that just is not meant to be today but tomorrow who knows br br nevertheless this film is not solely about love but life itself joy pain loneliness confusion everyday ups and downs and its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all but rather warm and full of hope br br i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing and by further development i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future as far as everything else is concerned i can only say captivating makes you want to leave everything behind you flee to paris and live those little romances yourself
<START> in the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike he's gay you're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals br br the miracle of paris is burning is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their disappointments their dreams some of these dreams are so unattainable it's tragic many of the people are seriously in denial br br this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isn't for you but if you do see this movie you'll realise paris is burning isn't really about men wearing women's clothes it's about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives br br i've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things it's a commentary about materialism in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it celebrates about fame and adulation paris is burning is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies i've ever seen
<START> if you like films about school bullies brave children hilarious toddlers and worm eating then how to eat fried worms will appeal to you br br the film is about a boy named billy who when arriving on his first day at a new school discovers that some of his classmates have played a prank on him by putting worms into his lunch the school bully joe and his team of friends start teasing billy and calling him worm boy br br billy decides to play along by saying that he eats worms all the time joe and his friends don't believe him but billy assures them and bets joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants br br the boys take billy up on his bet leaving the weak stomached child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms cooked fried or alive br br the film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it for one it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are it also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children br br the film's protagonist billy is a strong minded and brave person who all of us can relate to it is easy to empathize with him as we silently cheer for him to reach his goal even though we might not always agree with what he's doing or the choices he makes br br the children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for that the child actors are the stars of this show showing true emotion and feeling than most other children's movies portray br br some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will perhaps even teenagers br br there are hardly any other good movies on circuit at the moment so if you're not in the mood to see snakes on a plane try worms on a plate in how to eat fried worms it is a feel good fun film and not just fear factor for kids
<START> this movie is practically impossible to describe the alternate title don't look up is a lot more descriptive like most japanese cinema the story is not as linear as american the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter the set is haunted by an actress who died during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s the director is the only one who saw this show if you have seen ringu the director hideo nakata is the same and liked it you'll like ghost actress i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu a truly scary and disturbing movie a 10
<START> if the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading br br this is by far one of the most boring movies i've had the pleasure to try and watch lately i found the dvd lying around at my friend's house and i made the sad mistake of not burning it br br i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c span br br i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere
<START> murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to the end of the line br br tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated made for tv knock off hurt my eyes it can't possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know sight unseen but that doesn't mean this update should be seen as a separate entity either although based on the original paramount screenplay there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left imminently forgettable with rare exception the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 still true today alas so this lurid compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers then as now ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels so much the better i loved the james m cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair halter tops turbans ugly decor and lush auburn locks of guest star samantha eggar who didn't try too hard in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube lee j cobb was able to hold my interest as a world weary tired looking keyes but richard crenna's affable and inoffensive walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a bad day improvement upon the original was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but instead of a mindless retread a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer the completist in me is thankful this speeded up me decade update was included as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better made columbo tv series i also flashed back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing john d macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's sexy john saxon wife and then frames her mild mannered husband for the crime and if i remember correctly there's also an open ended ending like double indemnity it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband
<START> this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item the outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of film making but ultimately fails in every extent it's a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic film br br the 2 disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the more than pretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc 1 contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc 2 contains the director's cut in an awful transfer in french br br what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking
<START> for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good movie br br it's in a class of its own yet it has an international potential br br the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of 'ghost' movie br br don't be afraid be thrilled
<START> this is just typical bruce willis action movie schtick watch it with some popcorn and your buddies rent it to save money br br none of it is realistic the battles aren't realistic the soldiers aren't realistic the victims aren't realistic and why was tom skerritt's character talking to willis from the deck of the carrier what's up with that he can't do that from inside the ship br br of course bruce w gets a machete wound there's a bunch of average explosions br br if this movie accurately represents the navy seals then don't get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue you br br the noble attack on the village bothered me the most front row seats to an ethnic cleansing as bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town so what does he do he crawls into town on his belly yep how many died while they were putzing around oh well a body count was needed i guess br br and if that one african guy was so important why didn't he get on the chopper with the elderly and children can he say duh br br finally the movie was very dark not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on br br rent it
<START> i really liked the film at ending i was in tears this film is incredible go watch the movie you will enjoy it i could have given it ranking more than 10 i liked the teasing between chance and sassy i like the leadership of shadow overall this movie was perfect br br its sequel is good but not good as this movie i think there should be a third sequel to it not only this film attracts children but also adults my whole family enjoyed this film chance was full of humor sassy is an intelligent cat br br again i say this movie is a must watch the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie this movie is a classic
<START> very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful it's terrible br br i wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series would've been better that way i guess but as a live action show it typifies the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy' of which power rangers is five multi coloured spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear the acting is woeful and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch it makes jean claude van damme look as equally as good as bruce lee which is an understatement in itself in fact they look as if they are jumping and dancing about like it was some version of the 'nutcracker' or they were doing ballet rather than fighting besides there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly br br kids show or not this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version is set in america you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us but rather in japan thus the somewhat 'fake' fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be juxtaposed onto the us version br br if you like this type of thing then stick with sentai the japanese equivalent
<START> spoilers i guess br br the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie i just couldn't get over it and what is wrong with mark wahlberg's character if i suddenly found myself crashed landed on a planet full of talking apes i'd be all like aaaahhhhhhh run for your lives the monkeys have inherited the earth but he's all like talking apes okay next that's pretty jaded i'd say he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis besides that this is rick baker's best work yet this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field 3 10
<START> emilio miraglia's first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror and this second film is even better we've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesn't lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result it's the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red queen' who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occur br br even though he only made two giallo's miraglia does have his own set of tributes it's obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called 'evelyn' he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too which is fine by me miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turn off as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
<START> boy this movie had me fooled i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy i got the cold shoulder that time this movie was and i'm truthful pretty damn good it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting some to the horrible acting and clichÃ© killings were so painful to watch i almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent i enjoyed it the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas which made things more intriguing the pov camera angles were awesome br br the movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman he than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him br br this movie had such bad acting with the exception of christopher allport that is was funny i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel
<START> after world war i an expedition representing the allied countries is sent to cambodia to stop the efforts of count mazovia in creating a zombie like army of soldiers and laborers hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to mazovia's actions the group presses through the jungle to angkor wat in spite of the perils the group includes armand who has his own agenda contrary to the group's wishes according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br heads up the zombie make up department revolted before the cameras started to roll br br also this revolt of the zombies has little to do with its supposed predecessor white zombie 1932 which starred bela lugosi if that film's zombies didn't thrill you this one's certainly won't a younger than usual dean jagger as armand louque stars as a man obsessive with blonde dorothy stone as claire duval a couple supporting performances are good devilish roy d'arcy as mazovia and subservient teru shimada as buna however neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the dumps br br revolt of the zombies 1936 victor halperin dean jagger dorothy stone roy d'arcy
<START> whether it's three guys in their tighty whiteys rapping to a dude bound in twine or a girl saying what up dog to a lump of roadkill there's something please everyone in knuckleface jones it is strange and surreal and not altogether a completely comprehensible yarn yet it never loses you the first time i saw it i nearly laughed myself sick and every night after i would come home and watch it again forget coyote ugly this is the movie that cemented my crush on piper perabo see it before it's too late
<START> i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and 1 is just too freakin' expensive for this this film is probably only notable for 2 things 1 it has a young keanu reeves and 2 it's directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie br br it's about a girl named robin played by olivia d'abo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works part time along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete br br overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and it's also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as it's also not in the movie itself so the cover's obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless you're a keanu fanatic i probably won't be hanging to it any longer i'm probably gonna give it to the cinema snob who's a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running
<START> the jokes are obvious the gags are corny and the characters are walking characatures but i couldn't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie no matter how many times i see it i still get a kick out of this one and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment it contains many quotable moments and some of the best sight gags i've seen to this day if you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start
