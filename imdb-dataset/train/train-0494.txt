<START> one of the most common entries in the 'goofs' category is anachronism though i'm beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable even ignored in very good films but are found front and center in rotten films kiss them for me is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism yet when watching it closely i found almost nothing specifically anachronistic br br the shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place the big 4 engine transport seen after the title honolulu 1944 appears to be the post war c 97 stratofreighter in mats colors the combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are douglas skyraiders which entered service after ww2 and were made famous by their service in vietnam br br but excepting these two pieces of film and of course the hairstyles everything else is very possibly period authentic it just 'feels' so wrong i'm an admirer of stanley donen we share the same birthday in his co directed on the town 1949 there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949 50 ford's yet there isn't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a ww2 period film in fact as i reflected later there isn't anything which says that this is supposed to be a ww2 period film it just feels that way based on a wartime broadway musical which was based on a ballet fancy free which may have been based on the work of artist paul cadmus the fleet's in 1934 its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in new york and so heavy with wartime associations its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell br br the first problem is old cary grant though far too old to represent a navy sbd dive bomber pilot it is a hollywood tradition for stars like grant gary cooper lou gehrig jimmy stewart charles lindbergh to play younger it was the role which he is miscast in not his age he plays an operator as they used to call them a guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it a hustler a wheeler dealer a de rigueur character in a service comedy grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style br br thinking back on the great grant comic performances like bringing up baby 1938 or arsenic and old lace 1944 and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly in kiss them he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isn't him people had already been exposed to the type most recently to comic phil silvers as sgt bilko on television the role would be perfected later by james garner but here grant just isn't funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his cary grantness rather than cajoling and finessing br br but the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women there can be no more echt 50s women than suzy parker and jayne mansfield they are unique to the decade marilyn monroe can be placed in a continuum with carole lombard and marie wilson and any number of dumb blonds and grace kelly was another high class dame think of mary astor but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like mansfield sure there were the 'sweater girls' e g lana turner of ww2 but mansfield was stretching the point suzy parker was the model who revolutionized the model business who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera see funny face 1957 also by stanley donen br br of course in high 50s style there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at 'wild' parties but never even a hint of sex think of the 50s tv shows bachelor father or the bob cummings show where dinner jacketed men returned from 'dates' alone the original book which i haven't read was published during the war and appeared as a play on broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences but broken down bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the vcr and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey br br so the lesson here is whatever the 'goof' it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane who actually hears charles foster kane say 'rosebud' and tolerated in fun dreck like westworld why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place but absolutely despised in a rotten film even if the goofs are really non existent
<START> what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it's budget br br good thing i went to see kill bill after this one br br to see a really scary movie would be crossroads br br bottom line i like girl in gold boots better than this crap
<START> what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reagan era cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala
<START> i just saw this at the toronto film festival and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again it is a character driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot might be br br considered spoilers so i'll just say that the storyline is clever the acting is superb and the effects are amazing well filmed and well paced too one of the best films i have seen in ages and very refreshing in this summer of dreary br br movies it had the audience laughing the whole time see it if you can i particularly liked the candy bar candy bar scene
<START> man if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed as for myself i was expecting a low budgeted cheeseball zombie flick and that's exactly what i got i wasn't disappointed at all i thought it was a cool little movie the zombies were exactly as they should be because all of the zombies had just been turned so they are freshly undead zombies obviously they did that because it would've been pretty costly if they had done full on rotted zombie fx i understood the whole thing i have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie it's called hood of the living dead for the love of god would you watch redneck zombies and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great of course not so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie i'll never understand oh and yes there are worse movies out there so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen 'cause you know you're full of it you ever watch zombiez or feardotcom or house of the dead those are some of the worst i've ever seen if you can't see that it's just a low budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans then something's wrong with you i just had fun with it thumbs up from me and i'd also like to see a sequel
<START> first off i must admit that both films i've seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points my czech isn't bad but having sat through two of his films i wish i hadn't even tried to learn samotari is too cool way too cool it's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together that's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague tiny really the main characters are between 20 and 30 they've got jobs and only one studies the best character is the young balkan girl her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day that's about it the only great character everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film if you like alright music see this film if you want to laugh at others' stupidity see this film if you like irony and dry humor see an original jarmusch not an imitation and under no circumstances see ondricek's film septej whisper that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes
<START> i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole susannah york michael craig harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister york he is also barking mad but apart from that your guess is as good as mine br br the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director risible
<START> this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies asides from it's little plot the weak drama and bits of comedy antics the movie is action packed with gun fighting and martial arts action kept me entertained from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie br br having an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended
<START> despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of friday the 13th concerning the further antics of psychopathic angela killing more nubile teens for their immorality at a camp br br pamela springsteen sister of bruce looks great there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the movie's so unintentionally comedic rather than suspenseful it's a stinker br br out of br br mpaa rated r for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use
<START> that's the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie what was the point this movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people not going to use the word actors and a script that you could tell didn't exist br br one of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said victorian story written by which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story the entire victorian section had no dialogue and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station br br ok time for the story it starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it oh blocking who needs you these newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls so he starts off the story in victorian times and here's how the scene goes guy and girl are in a field pretty music starts to play guy stares at girl girl stares at guy guy stares at girl cut back to movie that's pretty much all that happens for about half the movie br br the rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment so this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean if it were a dancer it would trip during the macarena none of the characters in this movie are likable the models are incredibly irritating the victorian people don't talk and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions so eventually all the girls get killed off and by killed off i mean drug offscreen ooh you showed one death and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on awesome br br how this guy even knows this story baffles me he says it's because he saw it but how there was no guy in that apartment the door was locked shut with no way out the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work how the hell did he see all that oh plot holes we do love you so the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying i think you made it up you're wasting our time despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place whatever this movie was stupid pointless and made no sense with a lot of plot holes i could go on and on about this movie but i don't see the need i'd much rather spend my time doing something uselful like widdle something hell's threshold more belongs in purgatory with 2 dumb models out of 10
<START> of life in some colleges of course there were artistic licenses taken but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges br br i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity equality etc and i can honestly say that it's there but the thing is when class lets out or when they're just hanging out waiting for class they students seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity is that bad not really everyone needs a feeling of belonging but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them otherwise you're creating your own segregation br br racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations fortunately nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering br br i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen br br so is higher learning overly dramatic exaggerated maybe is it way off mark it depends on where you went to or go to school the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen minus the hollywood exaggerations the race thing hit pretty close to home for me
<START> 9 11 is a classic example of cinema verite a sort of realist documentary in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history it's all tiny unobtrusive hand held video cameras often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming and by the director naudet's hand frequently wiping the screen br br in this film you get to know most of the firemen tony benatatos the rookie or 'probie' in ny fireman vernacular the fire chief joseph pfeiffer who finds he's lost his brother later on and a few others there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film just to emphasise the personal reflexive nature of the events the build up is quite dramatic and well done particularly the passing out ceremony at the fire department with a few useful swish pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork just like rob reiner's a few good men tony looks proud br br the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc1 while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next this is classic cinema verite there is also the eery haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless and this is before wtc2 collapses you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment br br the sound of the neighbouring wtc2 collapsing is so awfully sad poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen from the lobby it looks feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened you hear an enormous rumbling trembling maelstrom like that of a giant monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc1 are oblivious to this event where is the communication br br this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided cues like 'this really was a day like no other' or naudet's frequently banal pronouncements like 'you could see fear in everybody's eyes' and 'i knew tony was freaking out' the film is really just one long video diary there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day the effect would be greater you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and perhaps the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero br br i don't see much of a propaganda element in this film as some reviewers suggest this film is no triumph of the will by riefenstahl some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero so what br br there are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station is it staged br br there is an excellent finish very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais hiroshima mon amour with two strips of light reflected in the water shimmying
<START> i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms blom's directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel i e they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth shattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind
<START> i liked this movies its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine s have only one or none parent think back to all of those films mpk suman didn't have mom hmapk salman didn't have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see alock nath crying br br the film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid hero's nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriage the film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you br br overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of gilligan's island green acres the beverly hillbillies the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up br br it's a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane there could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty good br br i especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping i didn't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off
<START> this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways everyone in my family enjoyed it the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio br br one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise cracking side kick for comedy relief and there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture the birth of spirit but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all spirit was a great breath of fresh air don't get me wrong i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so br br spirit is another example of great animated fare as soon as it was over my kids wanted to watch it again i had the same feeling i thoroughly recommend it
<START> the film is based on kipling's heroic lines that inspire hollywood's biggest movie 1939 out of the drumbeat rhythm of kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year big on the score of its armies in battle its war elephants its bandit hordes its terror temples thugs and mystic mountains of india the picture is bigger still in its scope and sweep is thrill and action but biggest biggest of all in the life breathes through three gary grant victor mclagen and douglas fairbanks jr roaring reckless swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure it's a honest film of it all that makes gunga din a new experience in entertainment joan fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three the romance between fontaine and fairbanks jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen the motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show it's a fabulous furious and far flung adventure with the red blood and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of india and storm the screen with the lusty rousing robust life thunder of men who fight for the love of it and love for the fun of it the pictures is interpreted for the brave and roguish gary grant who rounded hundred villains thugs and the mean guru eduardo ciannelli grant shouts you're under arrest besides is the heroic water man sam jaffe who regiment colonel montagu love says of him you're a better man than i am gunga din
<START> i've really enjoyed this adaptation of emma i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again though it only lasts 107 minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are well portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompson's sense and sensibility br br as a foreigner i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth's mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen's novels
<START> i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here it's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality naturally sweet no added sugar br br one small point it seems to me that the mild objections raised about ustinov's character pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that pendelton is clearly a genius savant at this sort of thing yes the film was pretty computer illiterate but it did show pendelton 'studying computers' at his flat and i believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject practically overnight br br there were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that gnatpole was trying to test pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff i'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests it was a little unclear br br certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at it's necessary to know quite what their concept was they knew there was something about 'procedures' which was important they thought that the 'smart light' could actually control security rather than just indicate its state they thought that the dumb user terminal's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself though apart from things like graphics feature i don't see it meself br br mostly i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could and they did that rather well allowing them a bit of artistic license i don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note br br cd
