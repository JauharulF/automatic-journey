<START> to anyone not familiar with c s forrester's book this film should be interesting it is colorful well acted and depicts high adventure but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling i could hardly sit through it br br for some reason screen writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on of course the spoken word is different from the written word and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film but why do the screen writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it in this case the writers out did themselves br br just a few examples there was no mutiny on the renown the officers did take over the ship after the half insane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway for reasons implied but never given there was no court martial the court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere captain pellew does not appear appear in this part of the hornblower saga nor does col ortega's wife hornblower himself was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore there are plenty of such manipulations of forrester's story br br on a purely technical basis i think the film's repeated use of the flash back device hurts the continuity of the story br br why oh why did screen writers have to mess up a good story
<START> where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better known film directed by otto preminger the man who gave the world laura and this time he's got the same co stars dana andrews and gene tierney it must be said that tierney here is under used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to andrews br br he plays a tough hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him when suspicion falls on a cab driver tom tully he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the cabbie's daughter gene tierney tierney by the way looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story br br the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero by the end it turns into a morality tale with andrews developing a conscience over his crime br br it's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast a good entry in the field of noir forcefully directed by preminger and nicely played by andrews and tierney despite the slight miscasting of her character
<START> written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida this gangster flick is harsh violent loud gross unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word f k the most number of times almost three hours long and yes it can get repulsive a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord br br also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer steven bauer robert loggia mary elizabeth mastrantonio f murray abraham and angel salazar pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster is that powerful enough for you crime does not pay for long
<START> today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be who or perhaps why well believe it or not victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film which is about a poor desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for carfare to the united states it's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks the movie takes place in british dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of ireland all mr mclaglen's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk the movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point many others not only do not care they don't even know what the fuss is all about the morale of this movie is look out for the friend he may sell you out for a dime
<START> this movie's full title is waqt race against time that's a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest it strained my credulity too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be mocked for it br br it's not quite as awful as baghban or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji the central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family bw films if my father who raised me and who i love dearly treated me like big b did akshay i'd shoot him myself to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness
<START> baseketball is awesome it's hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing i have seen it so many times i have stopped counting but everytime it gets funnier br br trust me on this one baseketball is a surefire hit and i loved it and will continue to love it i hope one day there will be a special edition dvd brought out br br ten thumbs up
<START> i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode it is that enjoyable and it is quite scary but all in good ghoulish fun a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment mary traynor who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times
<START> i had the mis fortune to see this film at a showing in the us having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb br br the original film was a turkey but an interesting one it fitted into that early seventies post 1969 revolution thing this film just stinks of well nothing really it's that bad br br imagine a badly done perfume commercial see what i mean br br madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years she looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat br br guy ritchie who has built his reputation on lock stock could never direct either his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows he doesn't disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle br br please people take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below they are quite obviously business plants br br don't encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money br br
<START> i have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against iranian people if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that i'm against politicians in general but if you're looking to be offended i can't help you br br not in iran as this movie is banned there see imdb trivia for this movie which is a shame because the movie is great would it not be for grbavica this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin br br rightfully so it was the runner up or second place if you will why because it is a movie about oppression it's not even that this is a complete women issue it is about the government trying to keep the people down an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie but by banning it nothing is resolved and or can they make this movie disappear br br another reviewer had a great summary line comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well
<START> i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
<START> a beautiful film touching profoundly up the simple yet divine aspects of humanity br br this movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the only minor thing i subjectively object to is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story the acting is also very good and all the actors easily top actors in high profile films the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the story br br the moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn
<START> on sunday july 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg 1 was broadcast on showtime a spin off of and sequel to the 1994 film stargate starring kurt russell and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg 1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o'neill two l s michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as teal'c and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goa'uld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tok'ra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even then br br as with all long running series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the show's original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg 1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six year old daughter jack o'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason br br the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa'uld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa'uld as the series' main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re invention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg 1 his farscape co star the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran a former goa'uld host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o'neill and general hammond for the last two years they starred alongside the sg 1 faithful michael shanks amanda tapping and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise br br alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its august 2006 after ten seasons and 214 episodes the dream was finally over on march 13 2007 what began with children of the gods ended with unending the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci fi channel in the united states on june 22 2007 br br in the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the second longest running sci fi series in the world second only to doctor who 1963 1989 and the longest running american produced sci fi series having surpassed the x files only a few months before it ended br br stargate sg 1 represents the cornerstone of the stargate franchise in 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spin off series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 although plans for another feature film fell through two direct to dvd films stargate the ark of truth and stargate continuum were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future a third live action series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg 1 and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeed br br in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci fi television franchises such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two sci fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come
<START> i've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about teenagers seduce and kill man in his house and such i think i first saw parts of this film when i was about 10 years old when it was running on cable it made quite an impression it's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching and switch the channel when their parents come in when i saw who the cast was i couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie then again if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered then this is an interesting film also if i recall there's some pretty interesting pseudo lesbian moments probably the dumbest ending of all time but still memorable
<START> all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure but this is not the case vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor she was unbearable throughout the film her tom boy look does not really goes well even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
<START> this is a great show and will make you cry this group people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again email me and let's chat i have been to australia and they real do talk like this br br i want you to enjoy five mile creek and pass on these great stories of right and wrong and friendship to your kids i have all 40 episodes on dvd r that i have collected over the last 5 years see my five mile creek tribute at www mikeandvicki com and hear the extended theme music let's talk about them br br these people are so cool
<START> put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big budget debacle a thrash metal updating of dracula with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher styled jolts and gore christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern day not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century the film well produced but without a single original idea except for multi racial victims is both repulsive and lazy and after about an hour starts repeating itself from
<START> worst show i've ever seen the story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers and when they use some special device they morph into strange poorly designed suits the acting when they're not in the retarded looking suits is decent definitely not good but not the worst acting i've ever seen however when wearing their suits the actors' acting goes from bad to worse much much worse the hyper animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do even when they talk they look like they're having seizures the villains are stupider than the rangers every episode some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the rangers he she then sends a force of hyper animated aliens to attack the rangers the rangers then initialize their 10 hour transforming animation then they annihilate the aliens then the poorly designed villain which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil to a humanoid ladybug like creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation the power rangers fight the villain off then the villain turns into godzilla whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile yes they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants the power rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper animated and summon their zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real the power rangers win the villain gets mad they all teach a valuable lesson and the show ends that's it twenty five minutes of brain washing fake kung fu fighting
<START> think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond in this movie brosnan plays against type and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it works br br this is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting on the edge brosnan and a good compliant off the edge kinnear have some good lines my only cavil is that hope davis playing the oh so tolerant wife can i see your gun doesn't appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these men br br this movie is like a matador it plays with the audience while going for a kill the ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
<START> i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film not to mention surprised i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr the performance was so finely nuanced neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro not the baby faced mr mohr a very impressive performance indeed and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky indie films
<START> convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind down of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvall br br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost action packed in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact he's just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light warmth br br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as i'm concerned there's no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from him br br perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more high strung western type picture if slow paced stage productions don't interest you terribly you'll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often br br enjoy
