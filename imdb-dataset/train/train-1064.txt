<START> the arrival of white men in arctic canada challenges the freedom of a fearless eskimo hunter br br w s van dyke mgm's peripatetic director was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the arctic among the inuit his production was on location filming from april 1932 until november 1933 although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the studio while considered a documentary at the time we would likely term it a 'docudrama' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot storyline br br the film shows the daily life of the eskimo both winter summer and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight the constant striving for food is depicted and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus polar bear whale caribou the native language is used throughout with the use of title cards the only english is spoken by the fishermen mounties encountered by the eskimo in fact it is the arrival of white men both good bad and the change they make on eskimo society which is a major element in the narrative br br this pre code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the eskimo moral code particularly with their practice of wife sharing which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture in fact the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930's br br none of the cast receives screen credit which is a shame as there are some notable performances foremost among them is that of ray wise playing the leading role of mala the eskimo wise 1906 1952 was an alaskan native of inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part as handsome as any hollywood star he would continue acting using the name of ray mala in a sporadic film career often in tiny unbilled roles br br lovely japanese hawaiian actress lotus long plays mala's loyal second wife the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure director woody van dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict north west mounted police inspector the two decent hearted mounties who must deliver mala to canadian justice are played by joe sawyer edgar dearing both longtime movie character actors danish author peter freuchen upon whose books the film was based has a short vivid role of an evil wooden legged sea captain who unwisely rouses mala's icy wrath
<START> you have to understand when wargames was released in 1983 it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling real computers were beginning to show up in people's homes and for the first time society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie's premise excitingly prescient granted a talking computer that balanced it's free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it i've probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on br br fast forward 25 years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a sequel called wargames the dead code i'll just dig right in first of all the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects you're probably very confused right now the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub game within the web site called the dead code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons at some point in the game you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax and if you choose sarin then you're automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated in the movie this actually happens however since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sense br br second the avatar of the ai in this straight to dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop up ad esquire sound bite play with me baby because apparently in the future advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess and gets into porn br br third the motivation for these hackers is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie for some reason recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else that may work for your average sitcom but c'mon you don't learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie and then later there is the phrase good hunting will i swear they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr damon this will kid isn't bad but he was certainly wasn't like any obsessive hacker i've ever met i can't fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it exceptÂ professor falken and joshua wopr make a reappearance in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a dilapidated old tic tac toe machine with a higher pitched voice after some prodding joshua the ai has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole the only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that a recycled ending for a movie made from last month's compost br br the new movie was directed by a guy who's done 90210 and written by guys who do b movies the original was directed by a guy who's been keeping himself busy with heroes so you see the quality difference there there was talk of a real remake but i hope they don't destroy this classic all over again i swear if i have to i'll visit every gambling web site until i find the one that's run by a psychotic government computer the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing clicking and indigestion
<START> now what's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap michael dorn should stick to the star treck merchandise john diehl does anyone remember him in miami vice liked him there well whatever what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead nothing and that's what we get none of the characters is even likable the special effects are hilarious but not funny the story is a very bad joke there is no logic whatsoever for what's happening i got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of attack of the killer tomatoes kind of thing especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet br br if you happen to see it on tv switch channels your tv set will be ever thankful
<START> this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesn't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story br br one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i don't care what happens to them br br it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me
<START> as a long time fan of peter o'donnell's greatest creation i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty's life only alluded to in the novels br br as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment in this case i think not instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities br br in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor lob for me they were totally credible alexandra staden described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen modesty's poise and coolness her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon br br ok so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax's claim to the modesty blaise character it was made quickly and cheaply but i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories
<START> this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams laurel hardy and abbott costello the connection here is the year 1940 that's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach i'll mention the significance of the latter later on besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films it's also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley who composed their theme song which would be known as the cuckoo song dance of the cuckoos their score and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film if there is a more gag laden structure than usual in this l h film it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny that includes most of the sound and visual effects the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright in this one ollie has hornophobia from working at a noisy horn factory so dr finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest ollie doesn't like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they wouldn't have to go anywhere after they find one they like we find out that convict nick grainger richard cramer has just escaped i'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l h's longtime home as one could hope for it's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it oh and i have a couple more lasts to mention it's the final film appearance of both harry bernard who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman and that of ben turpin the cross eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge whose second l h appearance this was having previously married the boys in our wife the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment all right i mentioned 1940 being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios it was also the first year that a comedy team both born in the state of new jersey would make their first picture at what would be their home studio universal the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l h in the flying deuces the previous year his name was a edward sutherland p s it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled up carpet that incident caused oliver babe hardy to send her roses to her hospital room they fell in love and married on march 7 1940 it lasted until babe's death in 1957
<START> let me start by saying how much i love the tv series despite the tragic nature of a middle aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing manipulative father it was incredibly light hearted and fun to watch in practice in my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation br br this movie spin off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film this movie has a very dreary depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions seeing harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour br br the romance between harold and zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series in the tv series harold always went after respectable girls not strippers br br albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series in the movie albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises br br most movie spin offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull with the notable exception of the on the buses films which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself but steptoe and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile even below george and mildred br br my advice skip this one and see the second spin off steptoe and son ride again instead it has a much lighter tone is more faithful to the tv series and is actually very funny
<START> okay let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments that being said my g d this movie reeked i mean wow i didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than any roger corman movie corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script the only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said 'hey zombies are popular video games are popular what game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it resident evil no someone else got there first silent hill no too silent people will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly hey didn't sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies they're out of the platform biz we could get that for pennies ' br br basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game br br the first and major problem is that the original game was horrid i mean br br bad movie merchandising made into a worse game in two weeks and then shippe d out and bought by morons and their parents for christmas horrid the graphics were boring the monsters were boring the levels were boring the interface was boring the case was boring in other words this was a boring game and that was the arcade version the home version was even worse with the home version you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game but i digress br br the second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes huh didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on not to mention that every fight was shot from the perspective of a video game which may explain the tedious use of matrix style effects the problem with this is that the game was a first person shooter the player proceeds from the pov of the character maybe that's why they put in the game graphics to let you know that they were alluding to the game right whatever br br anyway the only thing that made this entire experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out br br to sum up don't go see this movie don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week run just run
<START> film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography
<START> if you have trouble suspending disbelief then this isn't for you consider a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own think about it she makes no attempt to locate the mother who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the baby into 'care' no social services now i know it's a fantasy before you know it young toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he emerges a happy man who loves everybody in nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide shantytown residents and for an encore he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the shantytown stands when oil is discovered there this wants some swallowing without the subsequent 'miracles' beginning with toto's dead mother the old lady who raised him rather than his biological one appearing to him and handing him a dove which doubles as a magic wand allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the rainbow br br on the other hand the film is up to here with charm and is easy to surrender to on balance a small masterpiece
<START> i'd like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan with a few notable exceptions and i generally have a low opinion of so called otakus as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky haired big eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors such as the plot and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash fatal fury the motion picture br br as seen through the glassy witless eyes of an otaku there's little to find fault with in fatal fury there's plenty of quirky japanese y humor one on one duels some dramatic moments and everything is beautifully drawn but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched predictable plot with cliched predictable characters culminating in a cliched predictable ending the love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which sulia heals terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment but it's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it and of course fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t a this is supplied gratuitously by the huge breasted mai shiranui and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name oh boy we're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle in which all the main characters engage the all powerful main villain in one on one combat in turn that's some thing that's always amused me even when battles in animes aren't taking place in a tournament they always happen as if they were regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever br br otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn't an anime the answer is an emphatic no all of this movie's charm what little of it there is resides in the actual drawings had fatal fury not been an anime it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000 if the show was still on the air that's the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad b movie in the guise of an anime epic if you're a fan of movies so bad that they're actually entertaining consider renting fatal fury or catch it on the sci fi channel as it is definitely one of those if you're an otaku please wake up and realize that a good 90 of the stuff you're watching is garbage as for everyone else buy a dreamcast and fatal fury mark of the wolves but don't even consider seeing this movie
<START> as far as the muppet line goes however this is not the best nor the second best this was marketed towards the kiddies but has some dark and emotionally upsetting adult moments to which parents may not wish to expose their children one of which showcases miss piggy going postal in a jealous rage which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work br br beyond that however the story is progressive and highly entertaining one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun br br i like this very much and enjoy it still today br br it rates a 7 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was br br i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a director writer of wiseguy making his feature debut blah well the director writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster br br this movie is absolutely appalling it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled clichÃ© ever there is nothing new with edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen br br some examples of just bad silly moments in edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles llcoolj driving a vintage firebird 3 guys being shot in the head br br this movie is the opposite of good br br stay away from edison
<START> for the attention of chuck davis and emefy i saw phantom lady many years ago when i was not yet a jazz buff there is an exhibition going until end of june in paris's brand new musee du quai branly named le siecle du jazz not to be missed with as a special entertainment nine excerpts from jazz movies including phantom lady's famous drums sequence i've seen gene krupa and elisha cook jr in almost all their film appearances and i can confirm the following 1 elisha cook jr was dubbed in the movie that was some progress since in most of his other appearances he was killed mainly in howard hawks's the big sleep 2 krupa probably dubbed cook in pl i could recognize his style since he had already graduated from the tom tom used and abused at the beginning of his career namely in 1937's hollywood hotel's sing sing sing sequence and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in french la caisse claire 3 the sequence from pl at least as shown in the museum is not censored harry carasso paris france
<START> even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholson's descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood redrum the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the allusions to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack a great script
<START> this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye ill never forget my experience watching it i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull pacino in scarface and crowe in gladiator combined this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi jinx ensues to say the least by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage
<START> as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for better or worse and i've now read and taught the novel for over three decades milo o'shea is still leopold bloom
<START> this was the funniest piece of film tape i have ever witnessed bar none i laughed myself sick the first three times i watched it i recommend it to everyone with the warning that if they can't handle the f sharps to stay far away at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view
<START> absolutely awful movie utter waste of time br br background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligible br br camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace br br after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure br br please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this
<START> this is a wonderful film first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women's baser motivations diverge vive la difference br br you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation it's not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be resisted that's just who we are br br there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud scripting br br watch out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition
