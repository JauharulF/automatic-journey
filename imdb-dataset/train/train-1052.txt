<START> with their no holds bar cruel offensive humor sure enough to offended anyone you would sure think this would be a laugh riot wrong worest movie since open water don't be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as i'm sure it wont do very good at all at the box office this movie had a lot of potential but fell to little to short no enough character development awkward actors and the upside of this movie was nudity boobs amazing if i had to see this movie again i myself would go postal
<START> i jotted down a few notes here on the first power lou lambada diamond phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell fest br br 1 lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in 4500 designer overcoats a 7300 designer silk suit and seeing his 3500 month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh br br 2 leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed and amazing breasts that are hi lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan at least back in the 1970's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like br br 3 professional psychics living in los angeles can afford 4 million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch's mullholland dr which at least had the good sense to make it's condo resident a successful movie director the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud br br 4 i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his how's it going' buddy boy line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since thanks for the ride lady from creepshow 2 br br 5 underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your 7300 gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous br br 6 the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released br br 7 movie satanists always amaze me here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible can fly and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins br br and on and on to be watched in the company of wise cracking friends while consuming beer you'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously br br 4 10
<START> ok where do we start with this little gem mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england town only one man can stop them and that man is mike brady now if that wasn't laughable enough stay tuned br br the footage of the slugs is what's known as stock footage no matter who the slugs attack or where they are the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown keep in mind this singular shot occupies at least half the movie br br the acting in the movie was knock down drag out steal your wallet punch your girlfriend kill your dog bad i'm sure there's worse but you're going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca because he was the best in the bunch br br as for horror this film is not to be taken seriously there isn't horror they're slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain
<START> i don't even know where to begin on this one it's all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie anaconda armageddon after all the man did co write bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta jones should become a porn star there's no room in legitimate acting for her i'm serious one of the worst movies i've ever seen ever
<START> the movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person no character is 100 good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100 bad rather all are just different the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions drama and entertainment for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions i would recommend all to see the movie madhavi sharma is a journalist who covers those hip shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper but this is not all then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children how brutally her voice is suppressed even she is fired from the job then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie i would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie please do not afford to miss it
<START> i may be biased i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club self published in 1994 the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor fred dresch who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment but jorja fox who plays delmar youngblood my character is stellar she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form i couldn't have done better myself this looks like real people hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home gracefully and heartfelt
<START> now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the di erector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay clichÃ© but somehow cute or is that clichÃ© piled upon clichÃ© no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant's gerry and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey presto comedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why
<START> this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry br br vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of deewar and on the waterfront will bring home an oscar it turned out to be rookie mistake br br even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic in the original brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace br br bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously
<START> a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting there are also some very innovatively shot scenes and good music although the daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unfitting to the situation although this is not a mayor problem it also poses interesting questions about justness of revenge and limits of friendship br br
<START> 1st watched 12 7 2002 3 out of 10 dir steve purcell typical mary kate ashley fare with a few more kisses it looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways in this episode of their adventures they are interns in rome for a fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about i guess besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about Â¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired then re hired then fired again then re hired again this is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it maybe the real world will be their next adventure if there is one even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring adventure' in the make believe let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults we'll see what happens then
<START> if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy br br the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes but the death scenes were very crappy in this the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent basically freddy's story comes full circle in this br br i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws br br 1 a nightmare on elm street 8 10 br br 2 freddy's dead the final nightmare 7 10 br br 3 a nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master 7 10 br br 4 a nightmare on elm street 3 the dream warriors 7 10 br br 5 a nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child 6 10 br br 6 a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy's revenge 3 10 br br i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is next on my list wes cravens new nightmare br br 7 10
<START> this is a decent little flick made in michigan about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather gunnar hansen and has grown up not so well adjusted in fact he's absolutely bonkers but tries not to be too obvious he's got an entourage too his own little demon angel that follow him around the demon never says a word but really doesn't have to and he's max schreck creepy let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like freeing people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women this is a decent portrayal of madness and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on but overall i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks
<START> the story is a little slow and a little stupid greta garbo doesn't look very good and i couldn't understand half the things she said because of her accent which was exaggerated for this role melvyn douglas meanwhile plays his normal unlikeable role and constance bennett is just so so except for a couple of her screams which were funny br br on the plus side roland young had the best role in the film i wish he had more lines as he disappeared in the second half of the story also it was interesting to see ruth gordon look so young i had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the '80s and a whacked out old woman story wise the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis pretending to be douglas falling down the slopes that was amazing and humorous footage br br overall i can see where this film garbo's last was not a box office success it just drags too much going on and on about deceptions it's an annoying story garbo knew it too and called it quits
<START> nine minutes of psychedelic pulsating often symmetric abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some birds silhouetted against other colors it was just not my cup of tea it's about 8Â½ minutes too long
<START> be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence br br the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways br br each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just silly br br this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don't know and i don't care
<START> i saw brother's shadow at the tribeca film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later the story of a prodigal son scott cohen returning to his family's custom furniture business after a stint in jail it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama memorable characters sharp observant dialog sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually br br but more than that it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility the talent of director screenwriter todd s yellin seems to emerge full blown but we get the sense he like his protagonist has paid his dues he knows how real people struggle in this world and he knows how we yearn to see or at least to experience vicariously success yet yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends in the end we see that jake's triumph doesn't lie in commissions or even in the esteem of his family but in the work he couldn't abandon if he tried br br it's an essential theme in a world and especially a movie industry that can't rise above the bottom line this film deserves a wide audience
<START> picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks sure did get my moneys worth could care less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of simpsons sorry mr groening the best part facial expressions recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes good friends and a couple of cold ones
<START> i actually didn't mind the geico commercials the first 50 of so times i saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing but seriously this is the best thing that these people could come up with this show sucks it is bland and feels like watching an episode of the office with the characters disguised as cavemen i know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but the office just does not do it for me okay i get it we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him the pseudo intellectual who really just has a barely functioning intellect and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted but so what i have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tv why would i want to waste another 1 336th of my week watching more of those type nominates please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment
<START> clark gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard boiled dame jean harlow he tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough gal attitude despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love when gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant anita loos' and howard emmett rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well drawn and surprising characters including a jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype gable and harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles and the direction is much better than you'd expect from sam wood one beautiful shot has harlow being inducted into the prison then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her this is one of the best of both the criminals in love and women's prison genres and has some of the best hard boiled dialogue ever written
<START> one of the finest musicals made one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again delicious the acting especially by ron moody as fagin is superb costumes are exquisite even the shabby ones br br the two young lads who play oliver and the artful dodger are wonderfully talented oliver reed does a great job portraying bill sykes to where you can't help but hope he comes to a terrible end which he does br br the dancing is cleverly choreographed and is mesmerizing oliver can hold its own with the likes of my fair lady the sound of music oklahoma etc a film for the entire family
