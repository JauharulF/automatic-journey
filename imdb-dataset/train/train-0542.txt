<START> the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time i'm glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this
<START> the movie within the movie a concept done many times in the history of cinema it is accomplished here as well as in any br br if you love carmen you'll love this version br br if you love flamenco you'll love this version br br the plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe the music is authentic the direction wonderful br br if you like dancing you'll love this version br br there is tragedy there is passion there is intrigue br br there is br br carmen
<START> although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw br br the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on br br in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting none shall pass and it's only a flesh wound i've had worse it was one of the funniest scenes i've seen in the past year br br the gladiator demon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical br br truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film br br
<START> berlin born in 1942 margarethe von trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer she has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews i've ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin street br br co writer von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war ii br br the husband of ruth weinstein jutta lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance ruth not only sits shivah the jews' week long mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors her american born daughter hannah maria schrader and her brother are a bit put off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannah's fiance a non jew named luis fedja van huet a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that she'll disown hannah if she doesn't give up doting handsome luis stay tuned br br a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussed br br so hannah having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruth's life traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 year old lena fischer doris schade now a widow as the happy to be interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the war time capital br br the young lena of 1943 katja riemann was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist fabian fischer martin feifel with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their names incidentally i wish imdb had not given fabian's name on its characters list with the false israel included it simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradation br br while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to aryans were exempted for a time until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to non jews the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity br br the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them jew loving whore being one appellation as a subplot lena more or less adopts eight year old ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde br br through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story br br von trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered br br the contrasts between rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element today's berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past von trotta makes that point very well br br the main actors are uniformly impressive lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters including the local police and military as a one way trip to oblivion the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past these things happen although the times's critic appears not to know that br br von trotta's hand is sure but not perfect a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top level hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim copy and paste school of teutonic nastiness but that's understandable br br the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self interested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti semitism that's why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre nazi endemic anti semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on br br the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always will br br 9 10
<START> hawk heaven for lovers of french cinema and by extension french screen actors actresses at its worst it's an indulgence actors getting to bitch about other actors question the validity of acting as a profession at all etc whilst at its best it's a glorious celebration send up of some of the finest actors currently working from a simple premise jean pierre marielle's request for water being ignored in a restaurant blier spins off in all directions and allows the cream of french cinema to strut their stuff before the camera even throwing in nods to those no longer around jean gabin lino ventura including the director's father bernard one of the great stalwarts of french cinema from whom he fields a celestial phone call at the end of the film discursive and prolix yes guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure
<START> this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle i imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors br br the story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting nicholas lea makes his x files debut though not as agent krycek but as a victim called michael i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself br br its different but enjoyable ignore any bad reviews you may hear watch it for yourself and make judgement then
<START> i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney excursion in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out br br not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept it's just told so oddly bad screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes seemingly i didn't actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit
<START> when i was flicking through the tv guide and came across twisted desire on the movie section i read it's description three words caught my eye melissa joan hart i find her role in sabrina the teenage witch absolutely vile i hate those kind of programs so i was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old love story starring her little did i know br br it finally started on the television i had my bucket ready in case i were to puke over it's cheesiness or soppiness you know what i mean at first you think she's just a nice ordinary girl who's in love but has mean parents then when you find out she's manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents so she could be with her true love you're like whoa you just don't expect this sort of role for that sort of actress she played her role very well in my opinion i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch and voilÃ  she did it perfectly congrats to her the movie was very good i'd definitely watch it again and recommend it to others
<START> i wasn't expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got a one liner user comment 2nd rate action movie didn't seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film on the other hand i wouldn't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5 0 but hey the movie had a 5 9 out of 10 score which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production br br now i understand that the 37 5 of people who rated this film a 10 excellent was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before over and over br br lundgren does not convince as an ex military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school his acting is just plain terrible emotionless and contrived lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids either they are great actors or compared to lundgren they seem great actors just because they seem natural and believable br br detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie a closed for weekend high security high school four teens in detention with a war veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in but the story something like the breakfast club meets die hard or is it panic room is full of unbelievable situations lots of clichÃ©s and stereotypical characters and let's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor br br alex karzis and kata dobÃ³ play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie even if he seems a low budget version of sam rockwell and she a milla jovovich wanna be in a movie where everything fails their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero
<START> this slick and gritty film consistently delivers it's one of frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get shorty you need to be punched in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for leonard's characters better then john glover in 52 pick up the relocation of the story from detroit novel to hollywood film elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag rum punch cat chaser city primeval and 52 pick up my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday
<START> the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's the plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks of course this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles however things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people including cloth manufacturers the cloth mill's workforces and even an old lady that does her washing every week the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances and the way that they don't always help as the old woman says at one point in the movie why cant you scientists just leave things alone br br like a lot ealing comedies this one stars sir alec guinness alec guinness is a fantastic actor he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence and he does in this film literally but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way he is suitably creepy in this film and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character an intelligent and ambitious but slightly naive scientist along with guinness the man in the white suit also features joan greenwood the deep voiced actress that co starred with guinness in the simply divine kind hearts and coronets and michael gough a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films the acting in the film isn't always great but it is always decent and it's fits with the film br br the man in the white suit is an intelligent thought provoking and witty comedy with a moral the comedy isn't always obvious and it doesn't always work but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs so that is forgivable i recommend this movie basically to anyone that is a fan of movies
<START> a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever declining spiral of domestic violence br br at times difficult to watch while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist prince as the knight on motorcycle steed he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy lisa even further two of his compositions computer blue admittedly the album's weakest track and darling nikki are shown as being songs that kill off an audience perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the slightly shorter than prince apollonia as 5'6 br br the nearly complete amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point and do perfectly well under the direction morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well particularly their stage act which is hilarious day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny which takes some doing br br lastly there's prince while i admit to bias i do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low key version of himself acting isn't his profession this was a film made for entertainment so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't robert deniro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded i don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people's comments but i've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit how would a film about domestic violence be shot then with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame br br the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie eraÂ until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths and this isn't some retro recreation prince's best film with oscar winning music it sees him at his zenith and it's saddening to realise that even though he would make some fine albums he would never again capture this high
<START> a found tape about 3 guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways br br yeah spoiler br br first of all the acting made this short not scary at all the woman seemed to have orgasms not suffering some of the punishments were so ridiculous what's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end the hammered hand and the pierced eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being investigated extra bullshit
<START> i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon jr 's editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series they're all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy they're both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story
<START> who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching i am really impressed it's a shame that more people have not seen it i loved as always hans zimmer's score and what a directorial debut by bernard rose yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well well regardless i love the interpretive potential it has everything and everyone in anna's played by charlotte burke dreams represents a real conflict in her life the house itself the tree mark the lighthouse etc it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon
<START> this movie was so bad it was terrible it was awful i cannot stress it enough the acting directing story characters and everything about it was bad it was so corny and clichÃ©d don't be fooled by the cover or the tag line the 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at are you frogging' kidding me it was ridiculous br br the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan ok now turn it off what i got from the film was a bunch of ugly annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways br br this movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time too i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible i just wanted to see how each bad actor died and it still wasn't worth it just looking at the cover is a waste of time this is seriously the worst movie ever rating doesn't deserve one
<START> just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2 part 1980 made for tv film attention but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev jim jones who built a church into a virtual empire and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking kool aid doused with cyanide br br done very tastefully but horrifying enough unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned guyana tragedy features an all star cast including ned beatty as rep leo ryan meg foster randy quaid brad dourif brenda vaccaro levar burton and madge sinclair but it is powers boothe in his first big role that really stands out as jim jones he actually becomes the man and his performance is riveting and chilling thus it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years
<START> there's no one else watching the movie my husband and i went to watch it last night it's just a small theater but there's usually a decent amount of people there not this time my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night now we know why br br the movie was by far one of the worst i've ever seen yes the cg was good but that was it the acting script dialog directing editing etc was god awful since we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie that is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of the mighty morphin power rangers godzilla mortal combat and the lord of the rings it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commanders of sauron's army br br the creatures were ridiculous you can't just introduce legions of dino dragon lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies not in an hour and a half br br the scene transitions are horrible i didn't fall asleep during the movie but even though it was an overly simple plot i found myself getting lost in the plot holes br br the characters were caucasian americans but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the script br br the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie failed ethan didn't cry when sarah died though he hadn't known her for very long during this life anyways he didn't seem too upset to be left in mordor not knowing where he was or how to get back we couldn't for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either br br oh and why did the dress that sarah's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth one more thing all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife jack does this as well then why does ethan get screwed he's left alone without the girl without a map compass helicopter to help him get back what's he supposed to do send smoke signals and if he gets back home does he just go back to his job he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had br br don't waste your time or money on this movie we only stayed til the end because we'd paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out the door
<START> 1927 and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade now that it had become the site of a multi million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established some of those in the calmer quarters of this film making factory were taking the time for a little self reflection the last command while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal it was written by lajos biro who had been on the scene long enough to know br br taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants Â emil jannings before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well timed performance often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has beens he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings's scenery chomping caricatures however as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range showing by turns delicate frailty serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance br br the director was another immigrant albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister the von was made up by the way and took a very distinctive approach to the craft of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes we open with a carefully constructed chaos with movement in converging directions which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen then when jannings arrives everything settles down jannings's performance is incredibly sedate and measured and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order br br sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic in fact he really seems to have an all round lack of interest in action in the scene of the prisoners' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance his camera eventually retreating to a fly on the wall position compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent which are a complex medley of point of view shots and intense close ups thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction br br as a personality on set it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell and in fact powell's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically it appears no one told his co stars they were not in a comedy evelyn brent is fairly good giving us some good emoting but overplaying it here and there the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself it's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless like a male ninotchka but he does a good job revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard hearted exterior br br the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film making process even a relatively tame example like this at the very least i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the behind the scenes view as it threatened the mystique of movie making which was still very much alive at this point as it turned out such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and according to some sources although the issue is a little vague a nomination for best picture this is significant since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self indulgent back slapping by the hollywood elite but elite or not they recognised good material when they saw it and were willing to reward it
<START> i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again br br i have seen action films i have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top br br not only does it have the worst male actor ever sly stallone playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it br br furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next it is a set of cliches of action genre with sly performing even worse than his other movies he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film now there is an actor who can't act a surprised b sad c anything else than his basic face br br i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it explosions are outstanding but then you can see better on the 4th of july landscapes are magnificient but then there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick br br go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies
