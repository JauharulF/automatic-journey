<START> i'd have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia l a etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian locale br br but if there ever were one deserving the top rating 10 on this site it's this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one it's also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least 10 12 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind br br not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen i caught it by chance on a mid day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman anna's mother whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlie's best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders br br the chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends as a sub story romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it br br checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles br br i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by you've got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films as well
<START> i love ghost stories in general but i particularly love chilly atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period style ghost stories this one qualifies on all counts a naive young lawyer solicitor in britspeak is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly deceased woman's estate it's the 1920s a time when many middle class brits go to the seaside on vacation for their health well guess what there's nothing healthy about the village of crythin gifford the creepy site of the elderly woman's hulking brooding victorian estate which is located on the fringes of a fog swathed salt marsh when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl none of the locals will help the endangered tot you find out why later on in the film he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit the woman in black she is no filmy gauzy wraith but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil the viewer only sees her a few times but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers you expect to see the woman in black at any moment when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there too waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail bitingly suspenseful we've seen many elements of this story before the locked room that no one enters the fog the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new seeming and compelling ghost story watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black
<START> this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of event horizon the costumes are like something from a mad max movie none of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to do it eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place i personally liked russell better in tango and cash escape from la new york and executive decision it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie
<START> definitely the product of young minds this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd who is still trying to find their place in the world while obsessing over every neurosis however i can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel gazing trite humor or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30 another problem is that the peripheral characters whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect that they fail to be relatable in any real way br br however one has to give some style points to the filmmakers who obviously grew up in the video generation and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non existent plot there are 2 points to remember here first beware of festival darlings second even though we live in the age of youtube not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big screen treatment but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film and if others 20 somethings can find something in it to identify with then all the better yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation just now coming of age will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications in the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point
<START> watched on hulu far too many commercials so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian i'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesn't take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening
<START> this movie was absolutly awful i can't think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot and dialogue what dialogue to think that i was a fan of the first one i use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time 2 10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1
<START> police investigations murder suspicion we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere however most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old it is garde a vue a unique movie by claude miller br br is there much of the action not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time but the way they are executed is the movie's great plus jerome charles martinaud michel serrault is being investigated by inspector gallien lino ventura and insector belmont guy marchand it's a new year's eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last in other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is to achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties br br some people criticize the script for being too wordy yet i would ask them what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk this wordiness touches the very roots of the genre in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told not too much and not too little of them just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting the most memorable flashbacks for me are when chantal romy schneider martinaud's wife talks about one lovely christmas but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace and since i saw garde a vue i always mention this film as one of the defenders of french cinema against accusations of mess and chaos br br but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won't find the content and its execution satisfactory yet garde a vue is worth seeing also for such people why for the sake of performances but here don't expect me to praise foremost romy schneider garde a vue is not romy schneider vehicle she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child she credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of elsa in la passante de sans souci it is still acted however romy schneider does not have much time on screen practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the new year at midnight her role is a purely supporting one who really rocks is lino ventura he is the middle aged inspector antoine gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate he is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of women's psyche he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on new year's eve michel serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie but thumbs up for mr ventura brilliant br br as far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed the entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which i have not mentioned before gorgeous music for me the talk of chantal and inspector gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment you are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see br br garde a vue is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances new year has turned and is it now easier to open the door you'll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by claude miller 8 10
<START> peeew this stinks as everyone knows it's based upon some geico insurance commercials what no one knows is why those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best hardly fodder for a series the talking geico gecko that's another story now that would make for an intriguing series and why on earth did abc as reported in the press actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from geico for this after all the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to tv phil hartman had a recurring saturday night live role as the unfrozen caveman lawyer over a decade ago and that's how a concept like this works best as an occasional installment but a regular series fuhgeddaboudit a 1960s series called it's about time also used the cavemen in the modern world concept it lasted one season br br one of the show's directors who was also responsible for the geico commercials was recently quoted as saying we were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell wrong br br in the annals of bad tv this is destined to take its place alongside 1972's me and the chimp as one of the all time worst the lead actor in the embarrassing chimp fiasco actually went into shame by association hiding after it was abruptly canceled no doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit
<START> a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle they demand a huge ransom for her release peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack they try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter the helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that not going well so far also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts in reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem he starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives the rest of the film is a bit of a blur really br br now i'm not a massive jess franco fan in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen but even i can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out br br devil hunter is poorly lit infact i don't think it was lit at all badly dubbed poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him it has to be seen to be believed then of course there is the actual devil it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes he has very blurry vision br br the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the uk and was banned now why it was i have no idea there is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth br br there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle it would probably be more fun br br 3 10
<START> german private tv is ill renowned for copying dutch and Â naturally Â us formats well in the case of edel starck the xeroxing only went as far as the basics screwball br br you can't stand screwball comedy don't watch edel starck seriously if you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to law order or something well go somewhere else or watch law order as it's quite brilliant at what it does but i digress e s is funny often addresses thought provoking themes is funny romantic funny funny and witty too br br frankly i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re private german television productions german residents will understand what i'm talking about br br in short watch it i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like but hey it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons pseudo happy end included
<START> firstly there are some good things about this film but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that i've seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but she's a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and what's with that look she gives everyone perhaps it's part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book it's based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this
<START> what a moving film i have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore and she longs for companionship being in my late 40s i am beginning to see what she has been complaining about you are no longer youthful beautiful or touchable when may says this lump of a body wow how our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful i love when she begins to change what she wears the colorful scarf no longer the frumpy wife br br it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time sad in that may betrays her daughter's trust beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair and chooses to move on and finally have her own life i love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair br br mostly i love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships be they familial or not we see paula's vulnerability yet she will have what she wants at all costs when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if darren even wants a child the movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change and yet reveals what has been there all along dormant may has stifled her own creativity to raise a family a family that she didn't really want but was something you just did when she was young i love the scene when darren calls her an old tart and she smiles and says i was never called that before it was truly a gem of a movie br br and daniel craig well i just love him i was pleasantly surprised not only is he pleasant on the eyes he is a real talent what a neat role he is much more than any 007 that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature the scene where he is pleasuring may and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure a wonderful scene the contrast is the love scene with bruce bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure two completely different men br br alas i wonder where is my darren
<START> how cynical are the writers to pander so i may be an american citizen but i don't need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film i'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in u 571 which changes british submariners to american ones but you still walk away feeling a little slimy really the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes how sad unnecessary i'd just like to say to the writers it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that you've taken some very well tested shortcuts lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar coated tripe
<START> spoilers br br before i begin this let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the authorized version of this movie remade by stephen king himself in 1997 br br both advantages made me appreciate this version of the shining all the more br br also let me say that i've read mr king's book the shining on many occasions over the years and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work stanley kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling and scary br br kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay itself he acquired the title magus beyond question kubrick's genius is like magic the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut 1999 full metal jacket 1987 barry lyndon 1975 a clockwork orange 1971 2001 a space odyssey 1968 spartacus 1960 and many more br br the torrences jack wendy his wife and danny their son are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow until spring when the overlook reopens its doors it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow filled summer getaway br br the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging it lent to the atmosphere by having a dark yet at the same time welcoming atmosphere itself the furnishings and furniture was all period late 70's early 80's and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world br br the introduction of wendy and danny's characters was a stroke of genius you get the whole story of their past danny's imaginary friend tony and the story of jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice neat introductory scene there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously kubrick saw that from the beginning br br closing day again the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel this time with family in tow the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange br br the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking even as the staff is moving things out you get a chance to see the majestic fire places the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings dormants and crown moldings in the architecture they did a good job pink and gold are my favorite colors wendy torrence even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully built br br the maze was a magnificent touch reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center seeing wendy and danny entering it's a magickal moment one that tells you right away there are heavy energies in that house there's something seriously wrong already starting i wouldn't want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out the hotel manager br br scatman cruthers as dick halloran was genuine and open in his performance his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful you could actually believe you were there in the hotel taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and doc his explanation of the shining to danny was very well delivered as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel it was believable and sincere br br the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself with the mountains looming behind the cold air swirling about mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie it also marks the half way to hell point so to speak the turning point in the movie br br shelley duvall's portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful so what if she also played olive oyl it just shows her marvelous diversity honestly before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980 i said what olive oyl lol popeye was also released in 1980 but i took that back as soon as the movie started she's brilliant in this fiend's opinion this is her best performance to date although i did love her in steve martin's roxanne 1987 br br once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you the viewer need to be in possession the torrence's past danny's broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not mental but rather clairvoyant instead and the general layout of the hotel all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences the movie never stops scaring you br br the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker delbert grady the girls having appeared several times to danny first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel were icons with which danny could identify and of which he was afraid at the same time they were haunting and haunted themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed in a rather graphic and material way br br kubrick's tony was written as an attendant spirit like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father he was the little boy who lives in my mouth he would manifest in the end of danny's finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny not like in the book i realize where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy trying to save his father kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony took danny over the idea of danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't scary br br the woman in the shower scene done by lia beldan about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before or since as the younger woman and billie gibson who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting it was dramatic and frightening abhorrent and scary when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real br br jack quickly embarks on his trek from the jonesing alcoholic to a certifiable insane person the degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick jack's instant friendship with lloyd the bartender as only alcoholics would be mental patients and drug addicts do portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him namely alcohol hair of the dog that bit me jack torrence in jack's case it's bourbon on the rocks at no charge to jack orders from the house lloyd the bartender nice play on words br br when wendy find's jack's screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles when he asks from the shadows how do you like it and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand is so poignant it's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is how messed up jack is it's very scary dramatic and delivers a strong presence that coupled with danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood imposed over the scene between jack and wendy and with the confrontational ending to this scene make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie br br the redrum scene wow what do i say what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young troubled son standing over them with a huge knife talking in that freaky little voice exclaiming redrum over and over even if it had no meaning it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell it was something everyone could and has remember ed speaking of memorable scenes br br nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history his ad libbed line heeeeere's johnny was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror it also goes down in horror movie history br br the ending kubrick's ending was perfection i felt it ended beautifully no smarm no platitudinous whining no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie just epitomized perfection that's all i'll say on the subject of the ending br br who cares what was taken out look what kubrick put in rent it watch it buy it it's a classic in the horror genre and for good reason it rawks br br me being me take this movie and sitck it in your stephen king collection and take the 1997 authorized version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section that's where it belongs this movie rates a 9 98 from the fiend
<START> i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition br br if you didn't notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain he's driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunion br br i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention
<START> this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor what is he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover blade surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left what happened with the other 10 15 vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun that's really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality
<START> this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here there's an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointment br br that said there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
<START> wait don't tell me they threw out the movie and kept the out takes you know this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york the gangster bangster i guess gangster rap designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k mart hats budget rent a horsie it seems supplied the horsies the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words i though it was him talking you know watching this movie just confirms that it isn't about the acting anymore its about looks and it's about the money couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made just one more thing though where was ice t did he finally get to go on oprah
<START> this is a low budget scream style movie maddy is a new worker at a conspicuously unnamed office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co worker chris during a hot tub party chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a murder club where everyone has killed someone for kicks when maddy loses it and kills someone for real hijinks ensue br br the film looks good and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level nudity gore maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast but after the credits roll you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
<START> this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles it is too far fetched and at some points ridiculous if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts which i might add are poorly done and wish you were some warrior to the casting in this movie wasn't very good and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all on a scale of 1 10 10 being excellent 1 being horrible the acting in this movie is a 4 brenda song is talented in comedy but with this kind of movie in some of the more serious scenes her acting was laughable when she made some of her fighting poses i started laughing out loud i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing for example the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing how her voice turns dark and evil i think that was incredibly stupid and how wendy's brenda song teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks that was pretty ridiculous to so to sumamrize it all a disappointing movie but okay if you're 10 or under
