<START> first off i didn't know what to expect when i started the video br br anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present something gets inexplicably lost in the translation br br that's not the case here this movie just starts off on the right track it's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well crockzilla scene anyone that has to be seen and just try and keep a straight face this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production it's good to see someone is filling the need in this market very well done br br
<START> i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent br br new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human race's most powerful emotion br br the cast is huge a veritable oceans 11 with andy garcia ethan hawke shia labouf natalie portman bradley cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or another br br that's not to mention that there is a who's who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways brett rattner shaka kapur natalie portman i mean wow this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but that's good in my opinion go see it for yourself and reply to my review i want to hear what others have to say
<START> i caught this movie late at night on cable and i was pleasantly surprised i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known is because the subject matter is very disturbing but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic it is a well acted suspenseful and very interesting movie both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart the movie doesn't go out of its way to be brutal either like 8mm for instance br br i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies
<START> this is an very good movie this is one that i would rent over and over again it is not like your normal superhero movie this movie blends comedy action and great special effects it even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on the simpsons william h macy is the bomb
<START> we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release for it quickly became one of our family favorites the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba zillion times yet they still watch it religiously with friends it's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups similar to grease br br vanessa williams is spectacular jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet i've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him but our family gives him top ratings we loved his 'giant step' number marc kudisch as conrad supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers and brigitta dau as ursula just flat steals the show probably our favorite character in the entire movie br br the one disappointment was chynna philip's performance of kim part of that has to do with the writing kim's role is completely one dimensional complicating that philip's delivery is flat unimaginative unbelievable and just plain awful the director should have seen that and corrected it or never cast her to begin with br br overall though the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages
<START> i knew that 'evening' was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive br br survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film br br there's a monty python film about a knight who just won't die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she's not worried about having been a wide eyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess br br obviously being a girlie film there's a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character i'm not a woofter so i can't claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he's a bloodless cypher br br as you might gather the main characters aren't much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isn't the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face fungus didn't flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it br br i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if you're dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage br br apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you'd have thought that they'd have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby but we do as the audience if they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence br br another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties
<START> it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive maffia like character of russians or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country that it is too easy to rob a bank in england and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air in addition nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains but far to be the russian one so nicole if you really want to talk russian kindly go to moscow or st petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation
<START> minor spoiler br br underrated little stephen king shocker it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with the old micmac burial ground rachel's terminally ill sister and the jacob marley an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock pet sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda it's politically incorrect it's tasteless it's gratuitous and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer' horror movies never can add to that one of fred gwynne's best performances and mary lambert's witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie even with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans 7 5 out of 10
<START> shawshank godfather pulp fiction all good films great films but nothing and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all santa claus br br the film is so great and has so many messages i cried while watching it seriously this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream we see the sadness in his eyes and we feel the deep sorrow and then we wonder what is so bad about this ice cream is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil think movie makes you think br br this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever unlike other santas he is a normal person we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams and we wonder is the santa we believe in really that good also this santa actually mentions christ the whole meaning behind christmas br br you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24 7 whether it's christmas or not this movie gets a 500 10 whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool
<START> br br i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast one of the ones we got at hollywood video was this one zombie bloodbath this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual br br the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers bulldozed and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombies br br from this point on it's chunk city the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll br br ok it's not great art but this one with it's in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip
<START> i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989 i enjoyed it then and i still do now but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together and reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog there are some good songs ranging from upbeat let's make music together to downright emotional home to my heart i found the plot good although it does go off on a tangent once or twice the final scene of the film with charlie and anne marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation a film worth experiencing
<START> note i will reveal a key part of the plot but if you've looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material you'll already know it br br this movie seems to have been written by an eleven year old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it the writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an organism br br forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear not even gloves these are quibbles in the context of this movie in the scientific world within this story 2 2 6 34 and gravity goes sideways br br the fact is that the people in this movie do not with a few exceptions behave the way human beings behave almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate the love story of course there is one makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare br br i can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing
<START> an unoriginal overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something and in of all places surprise surprise antarctica br br the film features james spader and an almost nameless supporting cast with the exception of carl lewis who's actually not that bad for a non actor who deliver ho hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue to make things worse the film's pace is slow there's almost no subplot and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd what is a wonder is why spader an excellent actor at times who won the cannes best actor award for sex lies and videotape' and did a splendid job in the innovative sci fi flick stargate' chose to sign onto this lackluster project or maybe not if you look at his career for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits br br the most remarkable thing about alien hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci fi films and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived there are huge borrowed bits from the thing' both howard hawks' original and john carpenter's excellent 1982 remake contact' and outbreak' a few hints of alien' ce3k' the andromeda strain' kubrick's 2001' i e the alien black box' and mission to mars' i e the mystery message and even a little dash of sneakers' and a remarkable mind' although not sci fi films they share a cryptology' connection hell there's even cornfields and antarctica just like the recent x files movie' and the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from the abyss' br br its all been done before and done a whole lot better although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end i could say a little bit more about the plot but there's absolutely no need you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it 5 out of 10
<START> this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever i'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote they keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching i could not get out of the theatre fast enough when i saw it at that year's toronto film festival please never see this film
<START> crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty something friends in a small town in england all three professional women down out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british which is where i find she exudes the most is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends great supporting cast conflicts with her relationship unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that this is the type of film you either love or hate which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as love actually and three weddings and a funeral not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments
<START> barbra streisand in 1964 was still a curiosity and probably raised more than a few industry eyebrows when cbs signed her to 10 year 5 million television deal nothing these days but more important than that barbra and her manager insisted on creative control and got it she had this special filmed her way and for the most part her vision was by turns clever canny and incredible opening act i with the title song not written specifically for her streisand races through a classy cast of songs linked with i'm late from alice in wonderland she even keeps in the line about fuzzy ears and whiskers and too much time to shave this is a totally charming if not bizarre selection and enjoy it because it didn't make the two soundtrack albums released she slows down for make believe which gets perhaps too slow but the dramatic how does the wine taste is amazing a kid again is cute with streisand looking tiny in a huge chair is that where lily tomlin got the idea as is sweet zoo i'm an alligator crocodile no alligator where is the wonder is very cool and elegant and her people number surrounded by an orchestra who tap for her at the song's close is stunning act ii is set in new york city's bergdof goodman with streisand acting kooky in high fashion get ups when she playfully stomps on the mink the audience watching the tape actually gasps act iii before a studio audience made up of lucky fan club devotees begins with a powerful version of when the sun comes out streisand actually looks out of breath at the dramatic close followed by why did i choose you probably her best early song a too quick lover come back to me where she's ultimately drowned out by the orchestra and a 'funny girl' medley the finale happy days are here again which reportedly took 12 takes closes the hour in amazing fashion sponsored by chemstrand a fiber making company this black and white gem moves fast with jazzy set ups terrific cinematography kicky sets and costumes they really don't make 'em like this anymore and that pertains to the special and to la streisand
<START> after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come undone i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be i've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot the ending is very anti climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with in my opinion a waste of time
<START> shot into car from through the windscreen someone is playing someone else their latest song someone else didn't react according to the voice over i just wonder how that came to be made there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max if not then it was a total fabrication either way it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about taken at face value a nice portrait of the tortured genius we all believe ourselves to be
<START> bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most post halloween genre pieces but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy downÂ br br it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune like wilderness greg's older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze Â something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel br br i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain Â the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary r christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey i didn't quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically br br there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it's freakiest br br mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended
<START> this drama is unlike sex and the city where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other its much more personal and people can relate to it its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like sex and the city lipstick jungle br br dr katie roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well br br trudi malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9 11 and when a handsome stranger richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9 11 board for her husband's death lets see what his intentions are br br siobhan dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making as they are having trouble conceiving and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband played by raza jeffrey jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague lets see where her character venture to br br the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe
