<START> so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and not surprisingly the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason anywhoo the people laugh joke etc this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids they get scared they start to feel stuff oh no a girl see's s ghost some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls yeah yeah blah blah she does but oh no she dies as she does and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell two people survive and escape the house the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and elanor the one who dies saving the kids says oh no the acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss i was extremely disappointed when i watched this a very big let down my sister who gets sacred very easily got bored in this film it is appalling
<START> i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the cast crew selection on one of his dvd's and saw 'going overboard' and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn't hit puberty yet he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out i couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap i didn't laugh chuckle or even smirk at this movie actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie and it didn't work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever made ever
<START> i have seen the movie at the viennale a few years ago where the audiences liked it i liked it as well summer phoenix performance still haunts me thatÂ´s why i decided to write a comment br br the story unfolds in london around 1900 where a jewish girl decides to become an actress she tries desperately to become one but it isnÂ´t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being br br there were certain reviews were her performance was smashed they accused her of being dull not able to bring life to her character i think thatÂ´s her strong point thatÂ´s exactly what esther kahn should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise br br the cinematography is great the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad you can see how unpleasant life was back then br br the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie you loose touch with the characters after all itÂ´s only about finding the actor in yourself so there are no dramatic actions in the film itÂ´s phoenix credit that we donÂ´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour
<START> i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn't understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he's a pretty good actor i only see him getting better br br it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don't really care to watch another episode br br i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities
<START> this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure the genii in the bottle is a classic scene romantic in it's finish all things turn out as they should be i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true
<START> having enjoyed joyce's complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick's and fred haines's screenplay given the fabulous complexity of the original text however the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone naturalism and levity of the book br br it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film i imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot br br it's amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in dublin in 1967 the irish film censors only finally unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club the irish film theatre in the late 1970s joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967 br br it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and enact joyce's hugely transgressive text with such gusto br br bravo
<START> not a film to be taken seriously but a great little film nonetheless br br it's definitely not just a piece of fluff the acting imo is excellent br br one of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable like an old friend br br definitely worth seeing if you get the chance br br
<START> i truly enjoyed the movie however i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life first of all i was not aware of lucille there is very little hardly any mention of females being intimately involved with little richard even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned overall the movie was great i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor visually he did not remind me of little richard i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition he was a voyeur i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut
<START> why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon landing with the titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do i'll show those old meanies i'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane i'm running the other way it's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids it's audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969
<START> i never much liked the myra movie tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time certainly miss welch's costume became an iconic image though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about br br i rewatched myra on fmc a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years there's a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic books where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production however imho the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage or entertain
<START> i've seen a movie thats sort of like this were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces he then slices there tongue and eats it br br the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it he then starts to eat the woman naked br br i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in germany br br anyway the nose picker is fairly crap br br its a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very rubbish br br please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap br br i prefer day of the woman also known as i spit on your grave its one of the best cult movies ever check out this link http www imdb com title tt0077713
<START> the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band's assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it
<START> i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative critiques that i've read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it Â and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphy's great comedic style you have to keep in mind that 'golden child' is a 'fantasy' film Â just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our monitor all the copies we had went out fast with wait list requests that kept it on the queue for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented Â this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper Â it may not have done too well at the box office Â due to very poor marketing Â but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i adored the little boy who played the 'golden child' Â j l reate but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an on screen aura and could have continued with a film career i also adored victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as 'egg shen' in 'big trouble in little china' 1986 at any rate this was a great film the only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature Â such as 'chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes Â those were put in for the mind set of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now that's entertainment
<START> intergalactic criminal kol ross hagen has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose but tonight there's going to be a jailbreak and kol flees on a conveniently placed escape pod and flies towards earth which apparently is nearby there he confronts a group of teenagers who look thirty and a game warden john phillip law who help protect him from his worst nightmare the bounty hunter and executioner android or more properly gynoid the alienator br br from the cover of the box i was confident this was going to be an awful movie but as awful as it turned out to be it was a ton of fun as well probably at least partially because i was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome the director fred olen ray who has specialized in making over one hundred low grade films most notably hollywood chainsaw hookers does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects bonus p j soles appears as tara obviously at a low point in her career br br sure there's plot holes why are there hillbilly rednecks in california allegedly los angeles county if i understood the warden correctly what's up with the space woman's tacky blouse why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere what the heck is quadrant 5 how does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will short circuit an android yet land mines do virtually nothing why does kol look like a drunk native american football player with emphysema and the lund guy robert clarke does his character even have a point does the game he plays with the captain have a point does this movie have a point but the biggest mystery is the android or gynoid the alienator played by teagan clive what is an alienator why does it look like daryl hannah from blade runner only much larger because see if something is a cyborg it's part human but if it's an android it's all machine this was an android so there was no reason to make it look human it could have looked like anything yet the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker with david bowie's hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much if you're going to make a female android wouldn't the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in mission not accomplished they say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes but i think i found a huge exception br br if mystery science theater 3000 were still around today this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get harangued br br beyond the butt nasty alienator sorry teagan female weight lifters are gross the film is alright maybe there's not much of a story and maybe the characters aren't really very interesting and maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason what use does a killer robot have with a deer but overall i actually liked the movie i won't be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest dvd copy which i'm sure is just packed with amazing special features not but i consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future
<START> spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made probably in the style of ed wood without the heart the lightning is terrible the music is very bad piano and orgue come on the acting is well there is no acting br br there's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger br br the killer is a fat unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle br br every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichÃ©s of slashers movies in the film without effort br br the end is so far the most stupid ever made think about it the guy ken hebert who's acting skill is about the same as his writing he's the brain behind this flop invite a co worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week end and kills them on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen br br the tragedy is that mr hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation his uncle is the clown killer br br so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co worker goes missing br br whatever br br
<START> after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing br br not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable self now i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the time br br man i still can't believe he made this movie i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie hahahaha br br but i'm glad to have watched it thank goodness he has grown up
<START> being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i don't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context br br this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoying br br after having seen it you feel almost nothing you're not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe that's why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if that's good or bad is up to you
<START> boy this was one lousy movie while i haven't seen all of the burton taylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put upon staff when she's suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars
<START> in the immortal shaun of the dead we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the high and mighty alike are forced to battle flesh eating reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family at the end of the film it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour fido presents us with an epilogue to shaun set in 1950's america in a hilariously witty and original what if movie br br the film is set post zombie apocalypse for a change after the terrors of the zombie wars ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone the once fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left overs from the apocalyptic wars the idyllic town of willard is your typical pristine 50's suburbia with one small difference social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies unfortunately the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever due to their patriarch bill's fear of the reanimated dead timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours br br the zombie earns timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies and the two form a bond to rival the classic boy and his dog clichÃ© a boy and his zombie timmy names his pet fido and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison like routine bill has put them in but when fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido br br a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all star cast including the matrix 's carrie anne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido fido is a zom com for the ages with some rather twisted subplots for example the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre the film manages to bring out the worst and the best in its characters while still enabling you to care for them br br fido is by far one of the best dark comedies i've ever seen one of the best films that i've seen in a long time and the best zom com since the incredible shaun of the dead
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br james dial wesley snipes is hiding out on his ranch in montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist then he's approached by the agency again to travel to london to have another go his target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection but they don't want him merely to capture their man they want him taken out all goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief windsor charles dance is killed the blame falls at dial's feet hunted like an animal he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named emily eliza bennett who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him br br this latest snipes straight to dvd escapade came out of nowhere with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time i don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere with this in mind and after snipes's history of duff dvd efforts this might have seemed like one which snoop dawg would tell you to drop like it's hot but i felt compelled to give it a go anyway it doesn't rank among his worst but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones the detonator 7 seconds says it all really either br br this is at best mildly suspenseful with a minimal of action naff all in the way of cool dialogue and snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role likewise in a main supporting role it's quite clear dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their cvs br br it says a lot that by the end the only 'contract' that's keeping you interested is when snipes's will end with sony and with it an end to any further sub par el dvd action films
