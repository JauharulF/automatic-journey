<START> husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom the film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great the stooges are always funny when they cook however after the first few minutes of cooking footage we cut to original footage of brideless groom one thing i noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match br br husbands beware does have a new ending but i won't give it away to those who want to be surprised br br out of 4 stars
<START> generally i like something light and fun so this film shouldn't have appealed to me but it grabbed me from the start the story of a family's choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over what if it was my family my choice i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt it was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away the story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch it shows what film makers can do without sex violence or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones like real life you really don't know what'll happen next or why people do the things that they do
<START> i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd's brand of humor the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last maybe i missed the point but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man
<START> i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know bigas luna born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in cataluÃ±a to be more precise br br luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women's milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this br br this movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limits br br i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 8 10
<START> i'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series i saw this film for the first time in 2005 on the late night fear friday on amc which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations i made it a point to watch the entire amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective looking back i still rate the house that dripped blood as my favorite followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum br br i think all of the elements that make this series charming the vintage '60s '70s style cinematography creepy to kooky far fetched tales and the utter britishness of it all right down the backing music came together better here than any of the others overall the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within br br the first story involves a horror writer and his wife who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction there is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy oh and those horrible prop teeth then again these are british actors maybe those were real br br the second story is the tale of a lonely old man peter cushing that has moved here to escape his loneliness yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love he seems to have found possible salvation at a local very creepy wax museum but it turns out he would have been much better off alone br br the third story includes the great christopher lee my fav british horror actor as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter he is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't like witchcraft she has a natural talent for it with good reason lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth but despite his best efforts the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow br br this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more authentic little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story it was after 3 am and i couldn't quite stay awake on the first try not from boredom but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film music becomes part of my dream great fun this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first not long after the lovely ingrid pitt a costar on his movie set came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight but he needn't have bothered for she was a real vampire herself the chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical and again in my half asleep state seemed rather confusing side note make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning amicus star britt ekland in the all time classic film the wicker man 1973 br br the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories but based on the stories themselves this is a classic objectively i would say the third story is best but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a british horror fan it's mandatory i'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can the last film of this series monster club 1980 is certainly the weakest i think the first 3 4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden 1967 are the best but if you like any of them you should watch them all at least once you'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites
<START> don't mistake war inc for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs it isn't br br this is an old fashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously coincidental plot twists stock characters given some depth in fun performances by john cusack joan cusack marisa tomei and hillary duff and a straightforward approach to the political content br br you see the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true yeah we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt inept pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now but none of that is the point br br here all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon sometimes in genius ways as the backdrop for a silly romp as john cusack's character the hit man with a heart tries to change his life with the help of the do gooder journalist who doesn't trust him tomei and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage duff cusack's sister joan plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss br br that's all and it works it's simple fun but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs then you might not find it as funny br br for all the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge
<START> there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie the girlfriend and i both love action films especially fight scenes bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome but this movie was not entertaining five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and angry facial expressions the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique the music isn't good either they fight to the rap and hip hop style of the streets 'cause these guys are thugs the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low budget dramas br br everything about this movie is classic b style the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway the film is called honor but there was no honor in making this film it was simply a waste of money and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable br br go see felon instead the fight scenes and situations are more real
<START> my child my sister dream br br how sweet all things would seem br br were we in that kind land to live together br br and there love slow and long br br there love and die among br br those scenes that image you that sumptuous weather br br charles baudelaire br br based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim enachanted april can be described in one sentence Â it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever this is the movie that actually affected my life i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and self pity and i would appreciate every minute of life with its joy and its sadness i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alone br br charming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love this little film is a diamond of highest quality
<START> i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little house u will not understand nor enjoy these movies br br now about loves abiding joy i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it this movie has a lot to do with jeff it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girls br br i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far was not crazy about the books cant wait until the next movie the way clark talks will get you every time i would love to see january jones do an appearance maybe a family reunion or something
<START> this movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me br br many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact using absurdity and obscenity the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails br br my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie my god it hurts in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great but it failed at least the director made something out of nothing but it isn't something good br br many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all it's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making no to correct myself it's even worse than that a movie with gags so bad that they aren't funny at all it's not even fun to watch the lead actor writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies the movie is too bad for that
<START> this was truly a great movie i loved dennis quaid and the entire baseball team jay hernandez is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch the chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds unite as one with one goal this team came back from the brink having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything i love movies like this as they really are very inspirational br br on top of that dennis quaid's character getting a place in the major leagues you can't do anything but root for this guy it just seems like when someone is supposed to do something they are going to do that things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click br br based on a true story this film will really make you think about the fact that nothing is impossible
<START> i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling i did not get a good feeling watching the preview i was not at all enthusiastic about this film and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films i was in fact proved right br br the first thing that threw me off was the title not that i have a problem with ebonics i am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar i heard the dialog saw the acting and all i could do was make faces br br i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone at least you got served was better than this in my opinion even the soundtrack didn't thrill me
<START> it was 1974 and it starred martin sheen br br that alone says what to expect of this movie br br and it was a movie according to the movie slovik had reformed got a good woman and didn't want to fight br br in real life slovik may have been a naive innocent or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system br br whoever slovik was or wasn't is for history to decide but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting and the movie took sides br br with no regard to servicemen who were in viet nam either in 1974 as willie nelson would say let's tell the truth it was about the viet nam war not wwii eoes was as propagandistic as gung ho was in the forties br br according to this movie slovik stated his position plain and simple he had a nervous problem heck i have a clinical nervous condition and trust me if i had done military duty it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on kp duty or latrine duty with no problem br br if we believe the teleflick slovik didn't have that option no doubt because of his criminal history br br whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer i've learned that movies from this decade or that decade in dealing with service or military duty will pretty much take the same stance over and over br br 1940s and 1950s serve your country br br 1960s and 1970s mock your country br br this is the history br br the whole movie seemed predictably hollywood to me he refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion br br such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful br br i'm not a catholic but i thought the recital of the hail mary by ned beatty and sheen at the end with the lord's prayer was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster br br i don't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at tricky dick nixon and the viet nam war br br i hope it was all worth it for slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example
<START> warning does contain spoilers br br open your eyes br br if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so just stop reading here and take my word for it you have to see this film i have seen it four times so far and i still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film then stop reading right now br br if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think br br i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well his name was mr krisak to me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on if we didn't like shakespeare then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it our class room was never a room it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge like minds br br i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind like the phone number of a long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix now if i didn't know better i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr krisak but giving them the benefit of the doubt we'll assume it wasn't him but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable br br he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real show me how you can tell that you are real this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i'm sure you can imagine everything from pain to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real after every scenario that we gave him he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless br br what if you are nothing but someone else's dream br br what if you were someone else's dream what a messed up question that is this was a question scenario posed to us about 15 years ago before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers how possible could it seem back then but if you look at today's technology now ask yourself what it you were a part of someone else's dream br br another brilliant but surreal film this year david lynch's mulholland drive explored similar areas but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to in short this is one film that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you br br open your eyes br br tom cruise plays david aames a young hot shot righteous full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy his board of governers the seven dwarfs think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them br br early in the film we meet one of david's gorgeous toys named julie gianni played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz david and julie play a good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous committed relationship this is the type of relationship commensurate with david's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life and although both talk a good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth br br next we meet brian shelby played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith's good buddy jason lee brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again and that is the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two br br at david's huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday brian enters with his date sofia sorrano played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another and in typical david fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with sofia to complicate things julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david david then spends the night with sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another there is no hanky panky the next day as david is leaving sofia's apartment he is greeted by julie who offers him a ride and from there well i think we have all seen the commercials br br that is all i will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze there is a subtext of death and possible panacea like cure alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesn't end there br br like many movies seem to thrive on today this film has a secret sixth sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze regardless of how it originated vanilla sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up something more i can understand to be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film all of the ersatz so called best pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular they lack substance a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it br br this is what film making is supposed to be like this is what a film is supposed to do to you it is supposed to make you feel something most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces this one isn't br br 10 out of 10 the best film of the year i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress diaz for best supporting cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor cameron crowe should there as well none of this may come to pass and that is a shame this is one film that should not be missed br br and on a final note i am quite sure mr krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question can you prove you are real or are we just a figment of someone's imagination are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers and i'm sure that is just fine with him br br open your eyes
<START> maybe i've seen one too many crime flick or maybe i don't take the right drugs br br this was the most clichÃ© ridden plot deficient plot absurd just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time br br as for the direction it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together br br in fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed br br it's a bad rip off of m the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre you'd be so much better off renting that instead
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes races what i got was nothing the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are going fast in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles its just ridiculous br br if you wanna see a real movie about cars see the fast and the furious series they may be a little cheesy but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be better yet just watch mischief 3000 the best car movie ever made i think
<START> if you're watching this movie you're either a fred olen ray fan you found it on the 4 99 shelf at suncoast and thought what do i have to lose or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched br br this movie is hysterically bad it's got everything a terrible movie needs a screenplay featuring jaw dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space actors that are not only wooden but seems to border on befuddled gratuitous nudity not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for and of course a 5' monster played by what i assume is fred olen ray's kid br br underneath it all however there is something resembling heart as if mickey judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie hey my dad can direct it yeah we can use red paint from my johnny's dad's hardware store and i know this ex stripper who can act in it br br watch for the blooper reel over the credits you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy br br incidentally biohazard ii the alien force is also worth a look but doesn't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does
<START> although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special br br if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers br br i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesn't kill the film but it does weaken it br br still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie
<START> please even if you are in the worst of the moods refrain from watching this flick br br i don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all on a friend's recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet poor acting stupid direction weak storyline and pathetic action sequences and when you blend this together you get double impact even least of the expectations were not met br br i guess i did learn one thing never watch van damme action flicks they are pure wastage of time
<START> it was jon pertwee who said it s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly well if that s the case pasty faces is very easy david baker as director screenwriter and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior britcoms like lock stock and trainspotting using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly alan mccaffrey especially suffers from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because there s not enough of a film to ruin br br pasty faces is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise i couldn t understand why it ended the way it did it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation that you still get paid to donate blood in america people who i know in america and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter so we ve got a very erroneous view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots perhaps but this doesn t stop pasty faces from being a crap comedy
