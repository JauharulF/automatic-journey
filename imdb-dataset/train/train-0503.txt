<START> this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans in his view br br the usual wackiness ensues with the human bridges eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home along the way he also gets the girl hannah br br this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while br br pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view
<START> according to the director this movie was popular in asia it is somewhat difficult to take these mats helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget almost no usd at all but it is fascinating to establish that mats helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie the ninja mission is i think the best one among all movies directed by him some special effects are quite enjoyable this is not a b or c movie it is a z movie but an enjoyable and fun z movie
<START> old horror movies are interesting plenty of screams plenty of shouts and plenty of humor to go along with it the blob is a classic in it's own work steve mcqueen 1930 80 plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky he ends up being the victim and steve helps him out the best he can when its up to teen power this movie really provides it i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up when danger comes around they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about the blob running amok they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day and in my opinion i think it was jell o when everyone pitches in to stop the menace the town is once again safe thanks to good old cooperation i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time if you don't like jello tough rating 5 stars
<START> scary yes scary jam packed with nudity from fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in s a br br i first saw this film two years ago it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new age characters staring down between a girls legs br br girl you're not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found heaven br br steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together avoid
<START> this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition blazing saddles imagine the movie without the satire humor or writing skills but with all the trappings of a typical lame '70's sit com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was what the hell was lou gossett jr thinking when he signed onto this disaster this was possibly the worst thing he's been in and yes i'm including the first punisher movie and iron eagles 3 steve landesberg i understand as he can't say no to crap br br my grade f
<START> this is one military drama i like a lot tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett this marine is no nonsense in your face and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done there you have billy zane the phantom and others who plays richard miller a former swat form d c works for the government and takes orders only from them who needs a bureaucrat i don't when these two are paired sparks should be flying and how however beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works when the other sniper hits it's wits vs wits cat vs mouse gunman vs gunman and when the seasoned sniper is caught it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him who needs politics when you a pro like beckett he took orders from no one but himself plays by the rules and not the book and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics the movie was a direct hit watch it rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i do not fail to recognize haneke's above average film making skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable natural day lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination submission relations or feelings and or bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean d s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isn't in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times br br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isn't it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real life lives and experiences of those engaged in d s relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this
<START> okay what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now the witches' mountain has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet at the same time it's also strangely compelling there's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with but somehow i couldn't turn it off the scratching your head with confusion starts right away with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces heck no because after this intro the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore then cut to a guy with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way when she asks him to spend his vacation with her he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment great move the movie finally starts now as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks though not before he picks up a new girl patty shepard and photographs her topless throughout their journey all kind of strange events occur that Â you guessed it Â are never explained the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep really car jacking witches apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers that's as close as i get describing the plot but there's a good chance i'm way offÂ more important here is the atmosphere the witches' mountain is occasionally very creepy with its spooky music and interesting cinematography the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay
<START> this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didn't get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i don't know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch napoleon dynamite instead
<START> matt saunders luke wilson thinks he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson uma thurman who seems like a quiet but pretty woman though he soon learns that she's needy and possessive oh and she's also the superhero g girl though you wouldn't know it from the things she does to matt after he freaks out and breaks up with her br br a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution my super ex girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience what went wrong the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i didn't like the way they played it out i was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film however they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho it just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes the film wore out it's welcome sure there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out br br director ivan reitman has lost his touch after a successful run in the eighties and early nineties he started making crap like evolution and father's day i wouldn't say my super ex girlfriend is a complete bust but i don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds which isn't too much don payne did an awful job with the screenplay the majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one note he also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times br br a few of the actors were good enough to save the film uma thurman was great as g girl and she had many funny lines luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting i don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in the family stone anna faris was just doing her scary movie routine and it's getting a little old she needs a challenge or at least some better scripts wanda sykes is either hit or miss for me she was great in monster in law and she was bad in clerks 2 here she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie eddie izzard was alright nothing special rainn wilson was just annoying and not funny overall i was disappointed with the movie it wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average rating 5 10
<START> corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 2 10 but that's only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think i'm gonna dislike him
<START> this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
<START> i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever ' what haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on duh what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action of course not black mask is awesome wall to wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time it's also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too get slaughtered most of li's other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to black mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever and that made me a happy camper again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing
<START> i totally hated the movie it was so retarded they need to get some acting lessons no wait that won't help because the naked brothers band people a retards you know why i am here even though i am a naked brothers band hater to warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the nbb doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds not only are the song lyrics retarded they sing badly okay i'm kinda getting off the movie here anyways it was boring and they acted horribly it was not funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be i guess they deserve some credit for that well the movie isn't worth your time just look at its rating the movie and the series is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain seriously if you liked it you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act not babbling their lines in a monotone i am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually better than those nat and alex guys hurry before it's too late i seriously thought that herbie fully loaded was better than this piece of poopie i don't even know why i went through even half of that film i don't think it even deserves to be called a film
<START> i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact br br it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very powerful br br this subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism br br i wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
<START> it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors locations and genres i e douglas sutherland washington d c and political thriller but 'the sentinel' really hits a low it's like they had a great idea up front signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger not only do i feel she's one of the worst actors in hollywood but i'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one and definitely the only bad actor in the film to win an acting oscar for 'l a confidential ' but she wasn't the only problem sutherland who i love as jack bauer on '24' once again playsÂjack i miss his old 'a time to kill' or 'a few good men' days douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in plot someone some secret service traitor wants the president dead and douglas is haphazardly being framed will someone believe him actually no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot half way through it's over before you know it and why did someone s want the president dead is that to be revealed in the sequel too many plot holes too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'the sentinel' is if you only see one movie a year you may not know who the mole is but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'law order' episode you'll know in the first few frames was it terrible not really the cinematography was good and despite sutherland playing jack again he's still got it
<START> shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon's character sebastian caine i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of self respect to account for
<START> body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget reeks the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if you're into old school wrestling circa 1970's through the mid 80' then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal needham the stars are roddy piper the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c list actors dirk benedict br br the synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that don't want him to succeed there's more but i don't want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline there's a few surprises near the end for die hard wrestling fans br br i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it
<START> this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a travesty br br first things first the story anakin's evolution there is none apart from a little make up around the eyes and a little yelling there is none he becomes young stupid cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness br br what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith unacceptable br br the fight scenes used too many digital doubles everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make believe doll house count dooku emperor palpatine anakin obi wan almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around br br in one specific fight scene obi wan and anakin in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart i realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust br br the writing was awful all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasn't enough i can't say enough bad things about this film too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters this is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered we know the rough picture of everything all lucas did was colour it in br br we knew anakin lost his limbs we knew luke and leia are brother and sister we knew luke is anakin's son we knew obi wan and yoda go to exile we knew everything nothing new is offered in this film if that's all the fans wanted then that's fine lucas couldn't have gone wrong br br but when anakin finally becomes darth vader and he asks after padme and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams nooooooooooooooooooooo that scene screamed b movie all the way and i was half expecting darth vader to go danger will robinson danger at any time that is what this is a b movie disguised by a huge budget and a ultra loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth
<START> oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip off of japan's ringu well i guess the u s made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i can't believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them
