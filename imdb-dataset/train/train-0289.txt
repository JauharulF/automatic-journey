<START> in theory films should be a form of entertainment while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film making most movies specially genre films must not only tell it's story or message they must entertain their target audience in some way all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low budget a bad movie is one that is boring br br hellborn or asylum of the damned as is known in the u s is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving and irremediably boring and tiresome while it has a very good premise it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesn't make things better on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b movie but here it is just a bad attempt at film making br br director philip j jones tells the tale of james bishop matt stasi a young psychiatry resident who just got his dream job at st andrew mental hospital but the old asylum seems to hide a secret after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices james decides to find out what is going on only to find the incredulity of his boss dr mccort bruce payne who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients br br while the premise is quite interesting the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clichÃ© of the genre of course there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichÃ©s but in hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving resulting in a boring and predictable storyline br br the acting is quite mediocre for the most part with one big exception bruce payne gives a top notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances br br despite all this flaws one thing has to be written about hellborn it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big budget hollywod horror productions also the make up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good sadly the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated making a huge contrast with the make up prosthetics br br hellborn is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results hardcore horror or b movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience 3 10
<START> a romance without feeling a drama of issues without point or drama this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account as if it isn't trying or as if the director editor scriptwriter team isn't really trying the actors are able they need better support br br one element that doesn't fail is the score by george delarue beautiful and moving what a shame it's attached to this film in a good film actors' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact this editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement the love scene is particularly grating in this respect an insult to the talents of the lead actors br br there is another element in the film that works location photography notably one moment in grand central station i'd guessed in advance what was going to happen but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking br br some commentators on this board have pointed out that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the maccarthy scare the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society it switches into conventional romance before any human feelings can move us it's away on a predictable 'thriller' escapade br br just as the film insults the talents of the actors it insults the issues it's pretends and fails to take up br br you are warned
<START> i feel the movie did not portray smith historically the goal of this movie was to tell smith's life in a way that would be comfortable to the lds church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern the movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of smith as a man i have taken it upon myself to study smith's life and have read both lds works and none lds works the movie like most lds projects was beautifully filmed and well acted however this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smith's relatively short life br br a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith another point is in portraying smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820's another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good naturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent br br i could go on and on this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment
<START> hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to aronofsky's movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did br br the film seems laughably anti gay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched skyward by a speeding car and lands dead on the pavement another is crucified and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike breakers who'd have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions br br the director uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not i'm not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure
<START> as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best br br the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont pines yes palms no and the same for the wedding service again nice grove of palm trees br br when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express did they ship themselves overnight in a crate come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur br br the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo the two should have switched roles br br the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible br br applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
<START> this is your only spoiler warning what a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered oscar worthy br br i divide material into three levels the first is the stage theatre here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and most importantly in the power of the writer a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better the best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show br br the second level is film in this medium a weaker writer can be used but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time with film the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing furthermore film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal br br the final level is literature in this context everything is imagined by the author translated onto paper and then re imagined by the reader far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio br br this is why adaptations can go up but never down novelizations are never better than the base film see the dime per dozen ones at your local book store whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book catch 22 and lotr movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies br br as for 'the last picture show' it fails it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right the characters talk the same and act the same it's pure futility add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film br br i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians the instructor raved about how sad the movie was what is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious had this been in color the scenes of impotence the pool party and the old hooker would be considered great comedy look what lucas did with 'american graffiti' a few years later br br the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film two visually powerful downbeat films apocalypse now and barry lyndon rely on them not this it's the 'last' i want to see of it 1 out of 5
<START> dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here cage and boyle are fine but what gives this neo noir its juice is hopper's creepy violent character and jt walsh's sneakiness br br a drifter gets mistaken for a hit man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head br br i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy and the opening scene in brokeback mountain when the character does the same thing but that's another story br br dennis hopper is at his best here cocky one step ahead villainous seething and explosively violent jt walsh rip is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately well almost br br there are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard working deputy in the town of red rock wyoming the first twist hits early on and from there it's a nice neo noir adventure in some sleepy little town satisfying 8 pts
<START> first let's get the hoopla out of the way hedy lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen here we have hedy as a young fresh faced 20 year old speaking in her native austrian i recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932 3 classic yes we see a brief close up of hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming runaway horse scenes naked the director gustav machaty uses the cover of branches reflections in puddles medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches her boyfriend pierre nay keeps his clothes on at all times yes fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes br br as other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary expressionism and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water farm machinery landscapes etc sweet sounding strings run for most of extase's length and the film has a feel of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept the script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of german spoken by the actors with english subtitles beneath even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film br br put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man why we are never told and what did eva see in him anyway money who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage she then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law after a ride on her horse eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle however her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner and so the romance is born her husband seeing that his rival must win eva later decides to shoot himself but i thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with eva br br despite being a 1990 reissue title on vhs the sound being 70 years old is a bit soft and with background crackles in line with films of its age after a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage this is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title i gave it 7 10
<START> i liked this movie very much although this movie doesn't boast of big or even known names its very charming its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part i rate this movie at 7 5
<START> i saw this picture in 1940 for 11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and like all epics is still an entertainment marvel b w and all you get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe eduardo cianelli are outstanding this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of kipling's poem over the body of gunga din and tells the untouchable you're a better man than i am gunga din they don't make movies of this character today the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine
<START> just a dumb old movie first stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is all's well than ends dumb br br i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's glamour oriented golden era that nose is so beautifulÂ so photogenicÂ the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour it's as though the director sensed that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short
<START> ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldn't have even known about it br br who cares it's christopher freakin' walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if you've ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trap br br a fun film and a must see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
<START> it's rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme it's even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think i've seen br br a remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i can't really express how good i thought it was so i won't try i'll just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
<START> if the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death the lion king 1 and a half is the total opposite full of whimsy and cheer the lion king told the story from the side of simba the young lion 1 and a half is from the view of timone and pumbaa a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor issue the movie is a little short on substance but disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches starring timone and pumbaa as they watch the movie with us my favorite is the sing along that happens halfway through the movie make sure you watch the bouncing bug disney has advertised 1 and a half as the rest of the story though it really isn't it is just a different perspective of the lion king without all of the serious stuff that pervaded most of the second half of the original disney classic credit nathan lane as timone and ernie sabella as pumbaa for their voice work without their efforts the movie may not have worked the sing they entertain and they make us laugh they also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog
<START> rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man they succeeded to some degree br br a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role so by this time he was pretty well set in the role doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles but the basic blasÃ© nick is still there one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress doctor bradford works for a living as a physician that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film br br he's got two murders to solve a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason the trainer suspects something afoot but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet this is after he comes to bill powell for help br br myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry br br the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene nat pendleton role all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell's butler was essaying that part br br if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films
<START> the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films br br but give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality tv it is quite different to the stephen king book true but i doubt whether hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form br br but on with the review br br ben richards arnold schwarzenegger is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a government media conglomerate amalgamation the economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like jumping for dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is the running man a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian played by the entertaining richard dawson where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical pro wresting esquire 'stalkers' br br some however try and speak up against the government when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield california a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm' i e kill the protest when richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd he is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader yaphet kotto and goes on the run br br however his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez marita conchita alonso in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on the running man br br and there of course the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode richards is launched into the post apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him amber also becomes curious about richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed guess what happens to her then so as amber richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop he's super arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent br br yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's arnie fun there's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns 'he had to split' being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending it's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host watch out for the cursing old lady and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings br br if you expect a high brow intelligent film you'll be disappointed but if you want a great 80s flick well this is it but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic br br if you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv we've already had that however with the ghoulish al qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet it seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets br br with that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far sightedness of this film of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity
<START> it's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one not because it's abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzi's honor disappoints some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i don't buy it only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano a dark character study set in mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did prizzi's honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdown br br the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc jack nicholson doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations she starts out the victim of her bigot father's disdain she proves to be supportive to her ex husband then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate br br the colours of the movie have a washed up quality like it was made in the early 70's and huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else there's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been morphed to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making
<START> it's a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning a middle and a end a nice clever mystery with an appealing heroine for all ages who wins us over with her wit and charm andrew fleming's film is indeed a modern marvel a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood he puts away the over reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very capable young actress and a talented supporting cast br br the film is based on the old books but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however the props might be different the heart still is a good mystery and there is clever one here one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth emma roberts is an old fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from today's films she is still good enough to get boys' attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals br br while taking a vacation to california our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is visited by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene and this is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual eventually the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences from the young ones to the adults in the audience it is a movie that deserves to be seen appreciated and enjoyed a film that is rare and delicate and it's not afraid to be classified as fun five stars
<START> ben masters kyd thomas dream lover '86 plays a sort of mike hammer character a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals kyd makes one big mistake when he stops morgan fairchild laura cassidy eva bomberg arizona summer '73 from getting beaten up and raped kyd takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home by the way kyd sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between kyd and laura all said and done this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only 1 50 and i really got ripped off
<START> and it's not because since her days on clarissa explains it all that i've had a bit of a crush on melissa joan hart who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s but was still able to get teenage roles sabrina the teenage witch was hart's next big leap after her clarissa days based on the comic strip sabrina spellman is you guessed it a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life she is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise cracking black cat as she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism br br as usual hart is the show's heart soul sabrina the teenage witch is quite moving and very funny and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was i only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy br br 10 10
