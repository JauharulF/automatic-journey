<START> two houses one street one phone booth one car a girl next door a boy next door and a zombie this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie all you need is some blue light ambient music and done not in the hands of dutch director van rouveroy though br br i like to organize bad movie evenings from time to time the concept is really simple get some booze get some film loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best laughs guaranteed br br the bizarre thing is van rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement to be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the dvd's commentary track again disbelieve and laughs guaranteed
<START> the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness the altered version of the archers' logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos it's strange to think that it's a wonderful life' came out in the same year no great coincidence the 1940s was awash with heaven and earth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junge's vision br br it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us i'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own br br as for the story this may be pressburger's best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events other than that it's tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says we're meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i don't see why i'm sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn't mean that this shouldn't occupy us as well there is as i've said before a lot going on br br consider the scene in which abraham farlan heaven's prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england 1945 ' dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth reeves looks smug br br snobbery well i don't see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music and that's not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they don't find it incomprehensible there's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else it's a clever scene br br one last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
<START> this movie is so great its set back in probably the 40's and meg ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart ' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it everytime i watch it i feel happy it's definitely a girl movie and i'm a girl so i like it i also love the music the violin is awesome but besides that i think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it
<START> marlon brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film his performance as the swede is the worst of his career and that is precisely what he intended it to be he doesn't overact instead he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth the scene where brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst funniest moment in the history of cinema as we witness him fall head first into a toilet it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in a streetcar named desire on the waterfront and the godfather br br i guess the real question is why marlon behaved like this in his later years was he sick of the movie business did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself i guess we'll never know but this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about br br on that note watch fellow acting veteran donald sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty
<START> so i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star i hated it it was so stupid and unrealistic i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project br br james g and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover but to just walk away i don't even want to get into what the movie is about because it is too stupid to pontificate about br br don't rent this it's horrible horrible
<START> i'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film jordi mollÃ  probably best known for his role as diego in ted demme's blow writes directs and stars br br i won't give away any plot points as the movie at least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry it i highly recommend it it's a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking creation br br mollÃ 's direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise br br unpredictable with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no somos nadie god is on air is an amazing film you can show off to your friends br br see it
<START> first of all i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan i think it's the greatest horror series ever for me freddy is the boogeyman of course freddy's dead which tried to be the last chapter back then is a weird movie it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films freddy has a lot of screen time some think it makes him less scary which i do agree and that's in my opinion exactly the point this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better who he is who he were how he became the man haunting our dreams for some people it's a bad thing it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween to truly enjoy this one you have to see things differently it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you this was the first one and it was awesome as the years passed by freddy killed more and more people and nobody could ever get rid of him for good now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror beside the story of freddy's past i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie no more kids in springwood only crazy grown ups the nightmare scenes are all great the soundtrack is awesome especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls in my opinion the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated maybe it is misunderstood or i have different tastes anyway all freddy fans should watch it it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too and a lot of cameos get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed
<START> basically this is an overlong unfunny action comedy first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie 1 and the sequel had it's moments unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs br br the humour in it is absolutely crude if you like burping farting stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this when it isn't crude it's idiotic the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me totally unfunny simply idiotic br br however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend otherwise i wouldn't have bothered the story is undeniably thin it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film the laughs don't come quick enough some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie airplane hotshots 1 2 br br 1 10 completely unfunny thin storyline a film that seems to be based on one idea i e what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film but simply didn't have enough material
<START> sorry fulci fans but i could not get through this one the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come the acting was puerile the story has been done and done and the direction was non existent br br massacre honestly looked like a children's film project but i've seen some of those and they actually look better than this did it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford anything not a dop not a director no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was it was a very poor cinematic experience one of my worst br br this was about the worst suck fest i've seen next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space i've nothing else to say about it br br it rates a 0 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critic's top 100 for a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed i had to look hard to find a copy i got the dvd version for about half price surprisingly it was only rated m15 the uncut version br br i doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so i'll make it brief br br this is perhaps one of the strangest movies i've seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very art house and the unusual theme there are many things in the film i still don't understand i've seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing film br br the filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable the main character is joe buck a 'cowboy' from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute he meets the crippled conman enrico 'ratso' rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual escapades what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different br br i felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start br br i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes the deprivation of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breaking down tenements most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a conman giggolo etc yet you can't help liking them joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film br br i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground breaking for its period at the time and even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite art house at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up br br on a personal level i must say i quite liked the film the imagery conveyed a dream like quality i particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching however as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills this is a film to be savoured and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flick br br although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting from what i understand from the flashbacks joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story he is a happy go lucky young stud who suppresses his darker memories the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso although i fail to see where they have got the idea from the theme of homo sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in joe buck's encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main story br br certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do while it has a simple sentimental story to it disguised by a hard edge the beauty of the film is in the strange often psychedelic sequences
<START> i saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it the period of queen victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world br br the script is perfect the acting is amazing the history and attention to detail is out of this world emily blunt is perfect as victoria funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the 1st and william iv is played by prince albert think blackadder br br this portrayal of victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once i'm sure she would have been on jeremey kyle show if it had been around then my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life br br a perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history
<START> sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what it's worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to connect i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly it rains frog it was if the writer said i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely oh sod it i'll just have it raining frogs i like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 4 10
<START> this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london in this case pimlico were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws taxes post war restrictions merry mayhem is what would happen br br the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago a small historical footnote long since forgotten to the new burgundians however this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please free from any interference from whitehall br br stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico others in the stand out cast include hermione baddeley paul duplis naughton wayne basil radford sir michael hordern br br welcome to burgundy
<START> a frank capra wonders of life film br br keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking hemo the magnificent br br in the mid 1950's at t and bell science teamed with famed hollywood director frank capra to produce a series of cbs television science films to educate the public about the universe around them a far cry from the dreary black white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars the capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye catching visuals shown in technicolor the four films our mr sun 1956 the strange case of the cosmic rays 1957 hemo the magnificent 1957 the unchained goddess 1958 quickly became schoolhouse favorites where they were endlessly shown in 16mm format br br the star of the series was dr frank c baxter 1896 1982 an affable english professor at the university of southern california this avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring dr baxter who won a peabody award for his achievements continued making high quality instructional films after the capra quartet were concluded br br hemo the magnificent which was produced written directed by capra relates the story of the human heart and blood circulation system using animation and gentle humor film star richard carlson appears as the fiction writer energetically helping dr baxter tell hemo's tale br br movie mavens will recognize sterling holloway as part of the tv production crew and the voices of marvin miller mel blanc june foray pinto colvig as various cartoon characters all uncredited br br the devotional scripture which begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor tone of the production
<START> this movie shows how racist john singleton is he portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system how quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it ice cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other when omar epps says i need to be with my people that racist remark spoke volume and john don't think for a minute that the picture of thomas jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention nice touch
<START> plato's run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer scarface and action star jeff speaksman the expert what i liked about plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato's sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10
<START> i can not quite understand why any of the reviewers gave this documentary 0 other than for political reasons no the film did not investigate both sides of the story but then surely one film in favour of chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall especially given a the history of cia involvement in latin america in fermenting civil unrest google national security archive and b the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of chavez supporters shooting non existent opponents what is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup surely a first in documentary making images of a coup from both sides
<START> first off i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler's i am stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast bette midler john goodman trini alvarado stephen collins marsha mason this is one of my favorite films of all time it deals with a mother raising a child on her own she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it roger ebert gave is 3 1 2 stars and it deserved 4 wonderful i give it 4 out of 4
<START> this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome br br the character development in this film is excellent we get to believe that harry is a businessman who neglects his family and georges is an innocent man who craves loving and care from the normal society acting is excellent and the cannes best actor award is well deserved br br the fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that georges misery towards his abandonment by his family and his desire to be treated like a normal person the song that gets played repeatedly also reinforces this message the film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured we have been treating them with discrimination and neglect a fact that is highlighted by the scene where georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen if we get to understand and share these people's world both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy br br i was so drawn into the film and the characters' emotional experiences it is a touching film for good natured souls
<START> while urban cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age in urban texas i also think that to truly critique this movie one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made there was good music fun times and yes a few rough and tumbles at the honky tonk roadhouses the relationship of bud and sissy like two ships passing in the night was well conceived when pam tore up the note that sissy had written to bud it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances the entire story was well thought out i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job i thought the screen play was well written and directed scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor
