<START> soylent green is a classic i have been waiting for someone to re do it they seem to be remaking sci fi classics these days i e war of the worlds and i am hoping some director producer will re do soylent green with todays computer animation and technology it would have the potential to be a great picture anti utopian films may not be that far fetched the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it we as humans have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand but there's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves despite all the diseases wars abortions birth control etc the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish classic malthusian economics states that any species including humans will multiply beyond their means of subsistence 6 billion and growing that's obscene
<START> i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time i have not done so ever since br br the strange thing is i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again and again br br eddie izzard is cultivated is poignant is a man of the world he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to engage in political discussion he is above that i would contrast him to george carlin who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain br br funniest guy on earth
<START> i can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity 'there's something about mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loser br br not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid br br 2 10 the bonus is from the one time i smiled it's not like i'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw 'rush hour' and laughed ourselves silly this movie just stunk
<START> you get a gift it is exquisitely wrapped the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper handmade and hand painted by the most talented of artists the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace it is a sight to behold br br then you cut the ribbon rip off the paper open up the box and find nothing that's toys you either enjoy the packaging or forget about it br br the film isn't without its point and purpose war is a not a good thing well isn't that original the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war war toys in particular are clearly a bad thing until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys it's like someone preaching a stern condescending sermon only to end by saying just kidding br br but even as an empty box the film fails close scrutiny yes it is a sight to behold with some remarkable striking images the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill but the images are cold and emotionally sterile like the screenplay the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold the film strives to be funny in a morose sort of way but the humor is forced and artificial robin williams as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire tosses in his ad lib shtick which only seems alien to the bizarre coldly structured world he is inhabiting indeed the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be for this film to work or make sense it needs to be set in its own universe an oz far removed from kansas every time the jokes jerk us back into reality the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham br br it is said that this was director barry levinson's pet project one that he had been striving to get made for ten years it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing like most pet projects that finally get made radioland murders radio flyer battlefield earth being great examples it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage he had already perfected it to death br br many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy mechanical wind up monstrosities so is the film itself
<START> i saw arthur the tv series and the books years ago and never was fond of the show very much if you're a fan of this cartoon sorry if i'm spoiling it for you but this is actually what i think lots of people liked it but i didn't br br the school kids characters seemed to fought all the time especially arther and dw they were nice to each other frequently but gradually i got tired of arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister dw however the name was spelled and dw was an adhd or add like 4 year old sister of arthur who was sometimes demanding which could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routines were like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc arthur's friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the arthur books and the parents well they didn't care very much br br the greatest cartoon was rocko's modern life not arthur no offense
<START> if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form you can do worse than pointing them at this movie br br quite simply it is the perfect combination of story script actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid br br the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities or is it in his head is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot niven describes his plight to the ground radio operator hunter br br the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff's photography and the incredible production designs br br the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor a fantastic marius goring br br not only a highpoint in british cinema but a highpoint in cinema period
<START> 'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spell binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best in depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole non mainstream non cliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
<START> director raoul walsh was like the michael bay of the '40's and years before that and i mean that in a positive way since i'm definitely ain't no bay hater his movies are just simple high quality entertainment just like the raoul walsh movies were in his days br br gentleman jim is fine quality entertainment besides a first class director it also features a first grade cast with raoul walsh's regular leading man errol flynn in the main part br br what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen they used some very dynamic camera work which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch with the end championship fight against john l sullivan as the ultimate highlight br br biopics of the '40's and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his her life from basically birth till death and everything mostly emotional aspects in between 'old' biopics were just made the same as movies that weren't based on actual real life persons which also means that the film makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character's personality and events that happened in his her life this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing br br errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j corbett aka gentleman jim not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the '40's of which this movie is one fysicaly he also looks in top shape he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout br br a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today br br 8 10
<START> i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since i found it hilarious i loved it's originality it's rare that someone makes a movie like this and it's sad too br br what i mean is i once read a book called the black hotel and as a film fan i always picture books as films kinda adapt them you know but as i read it i thought well this would make a great movie but of course it would have to be adapted to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book br br but then i thought well why sure it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults who knew what it contained where's the harm dammit my civil liberties were being crushed here a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of the black hotel br br in an ideal world censorship of films for adults should not exist but sadly whilst i accept that with intelligent adults such freedom might be harmless there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds br br however it's hard to see how la bete falls into that category br br on it's appearance in england the british censor dismissed it out of hand despite the '69 relaxation on nudity given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality had the censor passed any of it he'd have been looking for a new job on monday br br but in those days there was an alternative the g l c this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london where it was deemed audiences were more sopisticated than those who lived out in the sticks br br the film was duly submitted and passed however it later emerged that the board consisted of just four people three who voted plus a chairman and on the day one of the voters was off sick thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view la bete br br one of said voters thought like me that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting and the chairman didn't understand it so decided to err on the side of freedom br br when the missing voter finally saw the film they too thought it disgusting but it was too late the film had received its x london certificate and opened to mixed reaction the g l c film censorship board was disbanded soon after thus la bete only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke but i'm glad it was it's great if you haven't seen it do so it's a fantasy and as such it's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days
<START> an american in paris was in many ways the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical made at the height of mgm's powers as a musical powerhouse the film features memorable music from the gershwins who rightly have been called the 20th century's equivalent of beethoven and mozart br br gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm up for his best work in singin' in the rain 1952 the two films are actually closely linked aside from the arthur freed connection the broadway melody segment in rain owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film and it deserved to be as it showcases gene kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree br br the film's cast is uniformly excellent leslie caron incredibly making her film debut shows a maturity that makes you think she'd been making films for years her introductory dance sequence and later her work on the ballet provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in mgm musicals only by cyd charisse's work in singin' in the rain and the band wagon oscar levant is hilarious as kelly's stoic pal who gets two of the film's best moments during the end party sequence which i will not give away for anyone who hasn't seen the film and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state of the art for the time special effects br br less memorable are georges guetary as kelly's romantic rival though he does get a few musical highlights and nina foch as leslie caron's romantic rival the may december relationship between kelly's character and nina's reminded me of the same kept man relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffany's br br there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin' in the rain the ballet though lavish and well produced doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie without giving away the plot the ballet just happens with no real rhyme or reason and unlike the broadway melody sequence it really doesn't have anything to do with the plot and in the best musicals the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre br br making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet although the ending shouldn't be a surprise this is an mgm musical after all i was hoping for a bit more movie after the ballet ended it's as if director vincente minnelli felt that he couldn't follow the ballet with anything else the film literally left me in the lurch br br that negative aside an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywood's musicals it doesn't quite reach the heights of singin' in the rain but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time
<START> for those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten the disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the 1980s people were not seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material at least no what people expected a major problem profanity br br yes the idiots running the disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words including the lord's name in vain if you can believe that interspersed in these family films in fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes br br this movie in addition to the language problems has a nasty tone to it too which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning thankfully disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent '80s movies touchstone is disney just under another name
<START> this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star john curtis estes better known as john holmes boogie nights is also roughly based on his life maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead br br the problem is that the story is not very well told there are many law order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto val kilmer has two problems he is not nearly as hung as holmes is and no prosthesis this time around unlike in boogie nights and he is much better looking than mope holmes br br the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast the racist immature lowlifes he hangs out with or his wife and the police don't get much in the way of characterization br br the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to get lost br br having said all that anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldn't miss it
<START> director edward sedgwick an old hand at visual comedy successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting employing a large number of roach's reliable performers although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins a young kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves star struck cecilia rosina lawrence sedgwick who prefers using the entire m g m studio as his set does so here as cecilia always ready for an audition is treated by a would be paramour cinema star rinaldo lopez mischa auer to behind the scenes action of naturally a musical comedy featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes including their well known skit involving a tiny harmonica and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton russell hicks and walter long on balance one must hand the bays to mischa auer who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star a role which he largely creates and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley's filmic spectacles
<START> when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazi's who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i don't condone drugs like i don't condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good ol' xander might get another acting job it wasn't his acting though that was alright but the script just didn't make any sense sorry
<START> well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen the effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 you must see it if your in to horror slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time killer movie
<START> i am a big beatles fan my favorite beatle is paul and my least favorite is john i already knew quite a bit about the beatles music and the truth behind the breakup as well as things like john lennon's family and paul's band wings i was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between john and paul so many years after the breakup br br i was not disappointed by this movie although the story itself is fiction many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate these included how yoko ono would always be with john wherever he went the wings song silly love songs being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of apple studios playing music from the album let it be br br the actors did a very good job in playing john and paul the accents could had used maybe a bit more work but they seemed to act a lot like i've read the two former beatles used to act like i also liked the dialogue between them which was basically what the entire movie was br br the ending at first disappointed me but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it especially since this was how it really went in real life they also show the fantastic skit from saturday night live in which the beatles are offered 3 000 to perform on the show as compared to the 220 million others were offering them overall i was not disappointed with this movie it does really give you more of a feel for why the beatles broke up and why they never got back together
<START> okay like many other such films spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character he drops amusingly consistently threated one liners with fair frequency billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true it's not great art but if you went into wayne's world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
<START> incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th intense personal and completely riveting 9 11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no more br br viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured br br obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety br br after viewing 9 11 and seeing that it came out in 2002 i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought 9 11 all but renders his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again
<START> well this was one of those films i caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm i e not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn't go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i'd give it 6 5 out of 10
<START> a must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one easily one of the best animation cartoons released in a long time it took the the movies antz to a whole new level do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is similiar just go and enjoy
