<START> this is the first of the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare bbc series i've seen and if all of them are like this i might watch no more being practically the full text of the play is everything this romeo juliet has going for it lacking in all other departments alvin rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director both in the technical and artistic aspects in the former because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid take in consideration for example the badly edited first shot of abraham and balthasar in the opening scene or the nurse's entering of friar lawrence's cell asking where's romeo with him being so very in front of her that she'd clearly see him even if she was blind and in the latter because every single one of the performers is misdirected even if some of them are good actors rebecca saire looks exactly the way i've always imagined juliet to look like and she doesn't seem to be a bad actress for a teenager but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind patrick ryecart as romeo is even worse being not only as dull as juliet but also way too old and not even good looking coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the chucky doll putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written alan rickman in his screen debut plays tybalt like if he was darth vader which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings this tybalt is so mean looking that we don't believe the characters' pity after his demise as for paris i kept thinking of prince valium from spaceballs only celia johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice br br at 168 minutes this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters because the characters don't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles the best screen version is still franco zeffirelli's but to be fair this bbc one isn't nearly as bad as abominations like george cukor's flamboyant geriatric version or the crime against humanity that is baz luhrmann's feature length mtv video 4 10
<START> a disappointing end to a season that started so well br br exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on tv in any series where as this was rather bad br br well i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series br br its almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up they failed and rather spoilt everything br br lets hope this is not a trend for the future br br still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done
<START> as many others have stated this is a terrible movie from every aspect of movie making how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing br br many people have complained that it was shot on 'cheap' video cameras yes it was shot on video but not 'cheap' video what made it bad was the lighting white balancing shooting technique and editing br br there were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess harsh inconsistent lighting over use of hand held shooting ala woody allen choppy editing another allen technique but poorly done without real purpose br br the lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing very amateurish br br the simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level br br how this video ever made it to print is beyond me it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is
<START> watch the original with the same title from 1944 this made for tv movie is just god awful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesn't work is it the acting the poor directing ok so it's made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much as if you've watched it first br br there are a few things that are different from the original it's shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just don't fit the bill you just don't believe them and who could top edward g robinsons performance from the original if you want only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave if you watch it through it's almost sacrilege
<START> an inventive suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms not completely successful but taut surprising and well acted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw Â two men trapped in room and pitting against each other Â but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film it's like watching a lab experiment some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
<START> i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast especially coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film you've seen worse movies
<START> i first saw this movie on a local station on the sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970 uncut i was just a little kid at the time but i loved it and wasn't really that scared by it i thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline thinking back i'm still surprised that it was shown during the day on t v uncut in those years i've sought out this film ever since seen it over and over again and always loved it one would think john waters would have idolized this film it's got to be not only a scary film but one of the sleaziest trashiest films ever made at that time and surprisingly you don't hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as blood feast or the hills have eyes have acquired over the years it has a cult following but it should have really become a cult classic in my opinion as far as i know this came out a little before blood feast came out making this probably one of the first true gore films in fact this movie has elements of hershell gordon lewis and a little russ meyer thrown in for good measure br br anyway i recommend this for anyone who likes trashy sleazy black and white horror films from the early '60's i think the date at the end of it read 1960
<START> i've been watching this every night on vh1 this past week this is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's woodstock easy rider the beatles the death of morrison hendrix joplin are all here vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the drug years from the sanfrancisco bay area to studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the american culture from marijuana to lsd to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country the hippie movement the conservative resistance and how drugs effected the arts music movies etc featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage br br drug films the trip easy rider up in smoke reefer madness blow boogie nights
<START> i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film is it one of the best of the nightmare series maybe not but i had lots of fun with it freddy krueger reaches his evil wisecracking potential since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down i felt this so called final installment new nightmare is the real finale brought the series out of its slump there are some great nightmare sequences including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence especially when we see him out of the dreamscape hopping around like super mario and freddy belts out the funny one liner great graphics and since the movie was made about 10 years ago it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove anyone who remembers the first 8 bit nintendo remembers the powerglove br br the cast is superb lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead i haven't seen yaphet kotto since the running man and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago he's another great underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence and who can forget the cameos the best one is by johnny depp from the first nightmare playing a spokesman for an anti drug commercial br br the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome so for those who are looking to check this film out please rent or buy it on dvd hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed br br i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film it even elaborated on freddy's backstory the film is a great mix of humor and scares and the gross out effects are terrific could this have given better justice to the franchise of course it could have but rachel talalay did a fine job and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done br br and in closing i loved the montage over the opening credits fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation br br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact br br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd2 0 and dd5 1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd5 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws br br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the 'anatomy of a stunt' featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of' in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view br br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
<START> i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're enactment' but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l h bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast i enjoyed it
<START> man i really love the new dvd that universal put out i've never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy grainy vhs tapes for years unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs it sucks br br anyway troubled fashion model alison parker cristina raines moves into haunted nyc brownstone only it's more than just haunted it's also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest john carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch angels don't escape br br this has an all star cast full of old timey actors like ava gardner arthur kennedy jose ferrer etc as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken jeff goldblum who's voice was mysteriously overdubbed and tom berenger and you won't even recognize jerry orbach from law order i had to do a double take when i didn't quite place where i'd seen him before br br nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil and there's a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal it seems alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel br br an excellent creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldn't be missed i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy br br 7 out of 10 br br
<START> edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie br br this is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important br br pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more br br but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the town's people who are pecker's main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to her br br well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywood's typical standards br br to describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie that's it br br oh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez
<START> i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20 30 minutes the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody br br there is no real twist which is fine but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror br br admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80 90 minutes does not really cut it in fact it gets quite dull
<START> when i rented this movie to watch it i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating and you know what it worked kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time the story was boring the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project but it certainly played like one it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts
<START> this movie was advertised on radio television magazines etc almost every hour or every issue so when we went to the kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high but oh boy how sad this movie is it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce 'big hollywood movies' i am not a movie critic but i think a good movie starts with a good script and the script is a nightmare like my subject line says it is nothing and then looped you could just stare to the television as well without really seeing anything that was the feeling we've got when we saw shades shades is a bad production
<START> i have to admit that holly was not on my watch list for the edinburgh film festival however after the artistic director of the festival specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people prior to the screening of another film i decided to go to see it wow br br this film is dealing with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any compromise i have found myself crying a number of times during the movie and laughing at others speaking about an emotional roller coaster br br the lead actor thuy nguyen is a vietnamese newcomer who was only 14 at the time of filming and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role she reminded me of keisha castle hughes from whale rider but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute chances are that she will win numerous awards br br the main story is about a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a brothel in cambodia she meets an american played by ron livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to see from him who after spending some time with her decides to help her by that time however she is sold again and he is going on a search for her around cambodia the story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next br br the acting was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast udo kier very convincing as a sex tourist virgine ledoyen touching as a social worker and chris penn one of his last movies the asian cast was also superb br br although the film deals with this difficult subject matter it focuses successfully on telling a compelling powerful story it was shot in cambodia some scenes in real operating brothels which adds to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary it seems that the dp used a lot of hand held camera and close ups and overall it made you feel like you are right there as part of the story br br after the screening i was listening to other members of the audience as they left and it seemed that they were all stunned this is not an easy film to watch and i salute the filmmakers for not making a hollywood film br br it is by far the best film i have seen in the edinburgh film festival opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends
<START> you'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it however this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrong's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other it makes the computer overload problem the 1202 and 1201 alarms encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all and it takes the thirty seconds call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory br br if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo 11 go for from the earth to the moon or one of the pbs documentaries but skip this one
<START> this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting mr torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it wonderful performances br br it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally great unheard of movie br br it was done when ms farrel was very young i had always thought of her as a comedian but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful there is very little dialogs but that just make it seem more real mr torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling i must see movie
