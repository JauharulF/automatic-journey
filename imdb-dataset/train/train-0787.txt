<START> maddy debbie rochon is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a murder club ' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage for denting her car but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it br br the plot of this film originally titled make 'em bleed is very poorly conceived full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous out of left field twist ending some of the dialogue is downright laughable i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance but the supporting cast was atrocious however i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman as debbie's parents and julie strain an early victim br br score 4 out of 10
<START> i enjoyed this movie quite a lot i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it she portrays a housewife in an african american family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's danny glover success as an attorney she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly yet a little awkward toward her the various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama i give it a strong 8 10 i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon
<START> it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all star flick i laughed through the entire picture as did my entire family the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy the players were hysterical i'll bet they had a good old time while making it of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great and how about those everly sisters each of the two falco's and the divine music throughout rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic not to mention gregory hines burt reynolds the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references paul anka was his usual entertaining self with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his my way welcome home to vick performance br br i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends dreyfuss imitated him well i am also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie it's a joke not a terrifying gangsta film the cars and clothing were impressive as was the decorative vic's place br br truly i think of mad dog time as a musical comedy less harmful than many cartoons tv crime dramas and talk shows i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment
<START> i mark where there are spoilers overall comments if you can take a serious movie go see this have an open mind and you will enjoy it don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on the movie fits together nicely in the second half i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens br br i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago when will was going around promoting the movie he was great spent a lot of time with the fans thank you for the picture will about will's performance a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie show you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance this is not the case with will smith in this movie i didn't picture the fresh prince lol when i was watching this movie he was completely and utterly convincing in this very very serious role he has grown immensely as an actor i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performance br br about his character ben is very conflicted and tormented he's sad guilt ridden very determined but very scared very true to himself his character has a lot of depth and somehow will managed to bring that to life br br about emily rosario rosario did a nice job portraying emily a woman very much behind on her taxes maybe she's not the shining star will is in this movie but she was very convincing i think her character just did not have as much to work with as will's did br br about the plot no spoilers i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so but when things eventually fit together wow surprisingly well written and well thought out it's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you br br it actually takes a lot out of you to watch in the theater i was in most people were crying towards the end even grown men when you realize what ben is doing and why it's a very powerful moment br br minor spoilers which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed though i will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot away br br the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room at first it makes no sense whatsoever there was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish br br i hated ben at the beginning of the movie by the end of it i loved him and hated him that's how convincing will was i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra a blind man just trying to make his way in the world why he was treating ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie wait it out though everything in this movie wait it out br br ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for it's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt or if he genuinely wanted to help people i think it's a little bit of both i think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past i love his character you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing you hate him because of what he is doing to himself as a very good person both physically and emotionally nice job will
<START> a great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script basic plot summary man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie nothing flows you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time didn't he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke not that i can blame him i passed out 2 3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an aneurysm not worth the time effort or god forbid money only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched
<START> i have recently seen this movie due to jake's recent success with brokeback mountain i figured i would see the movies that i missed i had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that i had missed this movie at all it's a gripping father and son tale and it is also an underdog story i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale this movie appeals to all ages the only reason i give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle but it comes back strong in the end the acting was great the story was magnificent and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film go see this movie rent it buy it watch it love it i know i did
<START> uggh i really wasn't that impressed by this film though i must admit that it is technically well made it does get a 7 for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor in fact i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s it won the oscar for best picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing that's because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as meet me in st louis this movie is almost all singing and dancing in fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren't into this the film will quickly bore you give me more story as a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady diet of meringue it just doesn't satisfy in the long run br br to think this is the film that beat out a streetcar named desire and a place in the sun for best picture and to make matters worse the african queen and ace in the hole weren't even nominated in this category even more amazing to me is that ace in the hole lost for best writing screenplay to this film even though an american in paris had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song
<START> you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie well this was beyond that i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like 3 00 and i'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at it is really nothing short of pathetic about 30 minutes into the movie my friends started asking me to turn it off around 45 minutes they begged me after an hour we compromised to fast forward to the end so we could see how the conflict was resolved and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh seriously don't watch this movie it is beyond painful
<START> this game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest it was a light hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows but it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again
<START> i can count on one hand the number of good movies starring joe don baker this is not one of them br br interminable chase scenes dim witted dialogue and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send up on mst3k br br and that is the only way i was able to watch this
<START> the dvd was a joke the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and segals voice not even his pathetic when the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be br br while segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it br br if segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show because he has no talent what so ever in this br br this film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it i turned it off in about 20 minutes br br i will be asking for my money back at block buster mark from ontario canada
<START> having listened to and enjoyed harvey bernhard's omen ii commentary i was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish it's like a really bad tv movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote i think at the bit where michael lerner is confronted by what i can only describe as a high school cast of les miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief and then my mouth was going up and down because i was laughing so much dire i don't know why i have to write a minimum of ten lines i have made my point succinctly there's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage
<START> i purchased this movie on blu ray because it promised great visuals and music i was also a great fan of a similar movie baraka the movie is very much styled after baraka wide angles very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot even some of the scenes were identical the street with traffic whereas baraka told a great story juxtaposing nature man made environments spirituality and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story mediocre musical score and then poof it's finished i thought there must be some sort of mistake history of the world half the movie is egypt and landscape looks like arizona but i didn't bother to check seriously folks this is horrible rent it if you must but do not buy it the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out
<START> can a pix ever ever ever do anything right this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format since a pix doesn't even believe in pan and scan we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side of course not that you are missing much this movie is incredibly bad it's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 of the movie for no reason
<START> i like my ronald colman dashing and debonair the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and kismet i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost horrizon and random harvest a brooding colman isn't a favorite of mine br br but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for 1947 it became his best known part br br colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously he's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he's quite the jovial fellow for a change of pace now that that play has concluded its broadway run colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york about as opposite a part as you can get br br his leading lady in both is his former wife signe hasso who loves him dearly but can't take his change of moods when he's at work colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back but he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous moor othello and hasso with her role as desdemona br br unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor desdemona in the play killed in the same manner and now it's a matter for homicide cop joe sawyer br br colman's performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors i'd shudder to think so were there any unsolved homicides in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they essayed othello br br i could never quite buy the story for that reason but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part i'm sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend william powell for life with father others in the running that year were gregory peck for gentlemen's agreement john garfield for body and soul and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra br br colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including edmond o'brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of cassio in colman's jealous fantasy still you will find no iago equivalent in a double life no one prodding the jealousy it's all in his own mind br br and that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century
<START> i doubt this will ever even be a cult film i loved gram parsons to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less what could have been clever and moving was campy it was devoid of the music that made gram and had more filler than cheap dog food there was no background on gram or the colorful people of that era the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of gram's and all the versions of his afterlife adventures i have heard rock and roll is full of tales good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt they can be great stories even though exaggerated however this movie took a good story and turned into tripe stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull somehow i am tempted to steal every copy of grand theft parsons head out to the desert and burn them all
<START> this movie has one redeeming feature at one point after a character is attacked by an ax wielding fairy his brother asks him why is your dick over there chuck after suffering through almost an hour of bad film this almost made my drink come out my nose br br some of the acting isn't too bad but the kids all stink and p j soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film the story is weak and nobody does what you think or what common sense dictates they should br br of course there are a lot of story points that don't add up for example in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist a difficult feat since they apparently can't interact with physical matter however minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes they can't go figure br br lots of blood and guts though a few nice boobs but this doesn't make up for the deficiencies br br if you want a movie about the tooth fairy go rent darkness falls i think it's great though a lot of other reviewers don't share my opinion at least it sets a mood
<START> ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans now this movie wasn't a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seeker specialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost non existent casting was horrible the acting wasn't even worth elementary school level actors the direction must be faulted as well if you can't get a half way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for 3 1 50 for me 1 50 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie
<START> this is just a great fun lovely film it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors though this film may only be in black and white it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless this movie features great acting beautiful song and dance numbers and great design work and film shots follow the fleet is also comical there are funny moments moments that will make you laugh but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade how it can affect those today if you want to see something great check this out
<START> cradle of fear br br this isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack jacked uttering that sense of whoa what it is though is a slice of lo fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director alex chandon as a throwback to sleazy '70s and '80s horror br br this is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge br br the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth lead singer of the metal band cradle of filth executing a role he was destined to play br br as other's have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer kemper the father of our devilish avenging angel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum br br what this provides for the chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached we are also treated to close ups of skull's being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror and for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking did i just see what i thought i did because of course pretty woman this 'aint it reminds me of some of the gore fests created out of italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed br br story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the sick room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in film making as a viable form of supporting visuals using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film ok classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is
