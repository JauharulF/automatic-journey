<START> this film is described as a action comedy the first 15 minutes and james belushi's presence point to it being a humorous gangster film br br however the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending the film moves between comedy description used loosely and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in the lead female the angel of the title is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable extremes of character to be portrayed james belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script one to avoid
<START> this movie is a very relaxed romantic comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein though she does believe in her own skills tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancÃ© after her car stuffs up i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it if that is actually possible it happens here br br i personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists i thought they were fab and hilarious this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension if you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you
<START> i saw most of the episodes of rmftm as a teenager on cliffhanger theater running after midnight on a local station some years ago and then again when mystery science theatre riffed on it in the early 90's time has not been kind to it br br i can certainly make allowances for the special effects which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial imo commando cody's flying scenes were better than george reeves superman's in his tv show and i can also make allowances for the ahem acting and fight choreography except for the guy who plays the ruler of the moon men he is incredibly miscast he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing not the despotic ruler of an alien race even the corny dialog works all right everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers with no wasted time or pauses for things like thought or introspection since everyone does this the viewer finds it immersive after awhile and even to my modern sensibilities it doesn't bother much br br what really irritates me is the writing and the plotting i'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda powered rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls labeled up down and fast slow i'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter i'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train the plot goes through the same motions again and again br br dig it commando cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth or at least the usa against an insidious alien invasion but his office has no guards or security checkpoints they don't even have locks on the front doors so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff not once perhaps understandable but several times they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try and they never get any smarter to further prove my point allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone he does this over and over and over cody also flies his ship to the moon the woman assistant comes along to cook stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back cody captures one of the atomic ray guns and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn't be bothered to lock it up and so on br br and you would think that if cody's efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up instead of just working with the local police all the time this was supposed to be a military operation but they act like it's another episode of gangbusters br br it's all rather hard to stomach i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints and i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre even though he loses half of his fistfights but i just can't help yelling door lock the doooor when the gangsters simply walk into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in place not even a fence br br still it's ok of the three republic serials i've watched phantom creeps had a better plot and undersea kingdom had more atmosphere hah and a better hero than radar men but it's an ok time waster br br btw why radar men they didn't use radar they used atomic ray guns shouldn't the title have been atomic ray gun men from the moon
<START> when an orphanage manager goes on vacation his father takes over the details of the center and winds up renting the kids when a well off got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was tailor made for them why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with a trio of hairbrained carpet creepers no way would people like these two need kids to make life wonderful this movie makes it look like the real world works this way but i am the picture of dubiety
<START> there's a good movie lurking here but this isn't it the basic idea is good to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse but the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved br br for example our four heroes are understandably paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind yet they wear surgical masks some times not others some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person other times they seem completely unconcerned br br worse after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill or be killed world these people constantly behave like total newbs they don't bother accumulating proper equipment or food they're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere they don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers and after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes you have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about them br br so when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions it's impossible to take their soul searching seriously their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense br br on top of all this we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of chris pine his portrayal of an arrogant young james t kirk might have seemed shrewd when viewed in isolation but in carriers he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and boneheaded it's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range br br on the positive side the film looks excellent it's got an over sharp saturated look that really suits the southwestern us locale but that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper thin and annoying characters even if you're a fan of the end of the world genre you should save yourself the agony of watching carriers
<START> if hollywood is to be believed being in the the navy is nothing but a bludge though the sailors may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean it seems that their oceanic duties are completely non existent and somehow fred astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would be romantics such is the world of astaire and rogers mark sandrich's previous film 'top hat 1935 ' completely ignored the great depression that was then bringing america to its knees and presented audiences with a glittering world of the rich and famous it was the film's optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contributed to its success likewise here sandrich deliberately forgets that the life of a naval officer is difficult and draining and instead substitutes the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers br br bake baker astaire and sherry martin rogers are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage proposal after bake returns from several years of duty in the navy he finds sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated san francisco ballroom while the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and rebuff each other sherry's plain music teacher sister harriet hilliard looking really quite pretty receives a complete makeover and tries to charm superficial sailor bilge bilgey smith randolph scott there are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigans a few moments of mistaken identity and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it's in particularly amusing is the scene in which bake sabotages a performer's audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl unluckily for both of them it is an unfortunate sherry who drinks the bicarbonate of soda and loses her ability to sing br br 'follow the fleet 1936 ' was the fifth winning collaboration between fred astaire and ginger rogers and the third of five in which sandrich directed the pair irving berlin provided the film's music and lyrics and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in 'top hat 1935 ' 'swing time 1936 ' or 'shall we dance 1937 ' astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich man about town persona without much success but it's hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could only accompany being considerably wealthy the side plot of the romance between connie and bilge works well with the antics of the two main stars and harriet hilliard wearing a brunette wig to avoid clashing with ginger's blonde hair has a couple of emotional solo numbers including get thee behind me satan which was originally written for 'top hat '
<START> this movie is possibly the cheapest cheesiest and poorest sequel ever made br br yet it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish br br it's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions br br spoiler alert the first one's all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument then three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to belle part way through this little episode belle has wall eyes which made my siblings and i laugh so hard then she and the beast fight more over the letter and later learn the meaning of forgiveness how old are they certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness br br then the next one's all about lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance this coming from the man who could woo anything female and they make fifi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill belle and winds up getting off scotch free by the end of it what a message to send the kids br br then the next one's all about mrs potts being angsty and the next one after that's all about beast becoming overly possessive of a bird to the point where he just seems downright silly br br the animation's so ugly it kills there are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see and the coloring is awful br br belle's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong plus she's petty and very different from the usual belle br br and the side characters are annoying i mean cogsworth and lumiere fight almost all the time i know they did that in the movie but it was overdone in this br br but the worst character is mrs potts she's ruined in this i can't even describe it just buy it and see for yourself br br i give it a 1 10 for the sap but i give it a 10 10 for comedy
<START> some have praised atlantis the lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i don't think so at least not for thinking adults br br this script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that motif the characters are weak even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best an md medicine man a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mix and match quirks before the story about how one companion vinny played by don novello fr guido sarducci went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing br br only the main character milo thatch a young atlantis obsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him milo's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head br br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery garner's vocal performance is the high point i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don novello as the demolition expert vinny santorini was also notable for one or two well done funny lines but i've always liked father guido sarducci anyway br br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress br br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite i'm not so sure about that any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks that br br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness br br spoilers br br right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the coast of ireland should read the coast of iceland we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term hibernia but more than this they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland br br by making it the matter of a mis tranliterated letter the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post roman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the inscription far less trustworthy br br the shepherd's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the king's eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that milo's expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in atlantian br br automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in atlantian so it's got to be some sort automatic writing since no one left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life appeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the movie br br the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages no one expects that the original indo europeans would be able to converse in europe anymore than romans would understand that hard c s or their day became french ch s pronounced like sh s no less br br current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm when apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar machinery br br the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy br br kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in but any of it hardly qualifies her father for deification kashakim's foolishness almost single handedly wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the cataclysm stalled progress not a lot killed here but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they weren't boiled in lava first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them br br a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim's likeness when kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis br br even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or phases of the sun diagram br br if milo's grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain how rourke would have suffered from milo's reading it as part of the book ripping out the page which was dog eared in rourke's hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently only was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set alarms off in milo's head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing it's just thick headed foreshadowing br br the crew's double cross was not a character change we learned that vinny sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with br br niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from it's liquid it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas br br the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness with it's powersource restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing coddling the giant robot guardians and the sky cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to ours and definitely to early 20th century in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet chastened culture alone not to send it into hyperdrive br br end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they can't sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness br br 4 out of 10 the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it seeps ever lower
<START> i saw insomniac's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say i really found it to be quite good if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it the hole movie takes place inside his mind or does it the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film if not greater for those dom fans it has tons of candid moments from the set outtakes and a great interview with the director anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess the director dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection
<START> the makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it whether the period is the 20s the first story the present ie 1950 for the middle story or the 1910s the last costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls roland culver as ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers it's raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions he usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive the china seas great 30s film starring gable and harlow stole the plot from the mr know all episode and also nicked a story by kipling i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat i love that posh bird who plays his wife too
<START> it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i didn't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture
<START> this was a cute movie until the ending the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them it was a despicable movie for that reason
<START> i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd and it lived up to my memories of it i was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised i loved ring of fire in particular of the stories i hadn't seen the first time around br br gary cole is fantastic as evil sexy lucas buck lucas black as caleb is also a superb player i thought brenda bakke as selena coombs was also superb in her portrayal in fact the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other br br it's a shame the series was screwed by the network in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors because it was truly designed for adult viewing a mixture of comedy tragedy farce satire gothic romance and horror genres it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level br br i had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life long live gary cole sheriff lucas buck the most luscious fallen angel ever
<START> freeway killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone the police believe he is a random killer but sunny the blond heroine played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern so does the ex cop played by james russo and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses also starring richard belzer this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases but its really not a good movie for the most part check it out if you're really bored and have already seen the hitcher joy ride or breakdown otherwise stay away from the freeway
<START> when someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original also there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences br br well the 1973 tv version of double indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all fred macmurray was great as the lecherous leering insurance agent walter neff in the original richard crenna just seems world weary and tired edward g robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray's boss barton keys lee j cobb a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving back stabbing phyllis dietrichson while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place br br robert webber in the old richard gaines role as robinson's boss norton and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie in particular webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context br br however after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity this is one film that never should have been remade
<START> i've seen plenty of sci fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 my first one was sabretooth which actually is one of the more entertaining sci fi channel features in my opinion their quality varies some of them are average but decent sabretooth dragon fighter never cry werewolf swamp devil some are laughably bad and then there are some that are truly terrible raptor planet lies in the latter br br raptor planet a loose sequel to the 2004 sci fi channel original raptor island is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet are some of the worst looking effects i've seen in a low budget film the gore effects are even unconvincing br br the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason i forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs that's right folks the dinosaurs are aliens dinosaurs in outer space what's next sharks in space the rest of the plot is simple the human cast are picked off and eaten by now we've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i've seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks br br there are a few chuckles in it though there's one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant raptor also a bit of trivia this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie br br while raptor island wasn't a good film to begin with its a masterpiece compared to its sequel br br believe me when i say this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired it's darn near unwatchable
<START> show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though she's a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy br br many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays it's not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many others br br davies was adorable and a lively comedienne it's a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the day br br show people is a simple story told in a witty way it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
<START> i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a sermon i'll go to church but i don't want one from a movie i don't mind some supernatural themes after all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had horns br br and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained herein
<START> this movie is one of the many kung fu action films made in asia in the late '70s early '80s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies they hire a con artist gordon liu to try to scare them off when his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real but instead of making him a kung fu student the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers well it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he's learning the skills to be a kung fu expert it's sort of like in karate kid when mr miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores wax on wax off et cetera there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors this time it's not just tricks it's the real thing liu declares proudly thumping his chest if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one
<START> peter m cohen has a winner satire on the mating game twisted around and turned inside out the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as offensive and raunchy only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions it is in the tradition of what i call reality based satire following in the footsteps of in the company of men chasing amy your friends and neighbors and two girls and a guy cohen's dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations brian van holt zorie barber and jonathan abrahams are three distinct unrelenting sex obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy superbly played by judah domke are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator amanda peet underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar coated studio products
