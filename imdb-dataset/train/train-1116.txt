<START> i will warn you here i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasn't an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright br br i am here to tell you that they were wrong completely wrong br br well no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick they were right about that but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well br br tom beringer wasn't too bad i suppose no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers a way to made their film a guaranteed flop in that case it worked br br if they were actually aiming for success then why not cast somebody who can act oh and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write ah yes and a director who knows how to direct br br as someone who sat through this mess actually believing it would shortly redeem itself i can assure you it never did pity it could've been a good film
<START> having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum br br however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made and gripping film especially an action film since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies this was such great news to me ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll br br matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1 2 and now this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future br br the stunts were handled with style each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie well done
<START> i love this episode of columbo maybe it's because ruth gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer abigail mitchell an american version of dame agatha christie she is delicious to watch as the perky lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident she blames her niece's husband the nephew she plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her i would have loved somebody else than mariette hartley to play veronica i never really like hartley in anything personally and of course with columbo there are some laughs like when he questions veronica at a belly dancing class ruth's abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk
<START> ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
<START> while i loved this movie the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high br br i own the dvd so don't get me wrong i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it it's just that i still think the first scene was the best and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it
<START> this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film making may not open you up to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching based on the best selling book by james redfield first self published in 1993 this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher matthew settle who on traveling to deepest darkest phoniest peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir although there's a lot of talk about energy that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include thomas kretschmann annabeth gish hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon for those who care the plot involves the military terrorists and the roman catholic church armand mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr redfield barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script in short easily the worst film seen in 40 years of viewing movies
<START> david lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way they are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator br br the straight story is not a typical david lynch film not that there's anything typical about them anyway it's an odyssey through rural america a real life journey alvin straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house he rode 300 miles from laurens iowa to mt zion wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses br br at the heart of this film is sweet voiced richard farnsworth he brings alvin straight right to us in a simple and honest way the fact that the film is slow paced matches alvin's slow journey toward realization br br along the way alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl she is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation after listening to alvin speak about family she reconsiders br br later alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car she complains that she has killed several and leaves alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night br br later alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him a nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed they even let him call his sweet but slow daughter nicely played by sissy spacek whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past alvin insists on paying for the call the man even offers to drive alvin to his brothers with pleasure alvin declines with thanks br br while alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him br br alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower he talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs he even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother br br the night before alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him the man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks alvin to write to him this scene is perfect in it's simplicity it's heartfelt because it's so straight so real br br the journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it we want alvin to get to his brothers we want him to make amends we want to know this world is full of forgiveness br br this was richard farnsworth at his best it was his last film and his performance was amazing you can't help but to understand his pride to listen to his wisdom and to ultimately feel his pain one becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in br br if there's justice in the afterlife then alvin straight his brother and richard farnsworth are together sitting at a bar i can picture them discussing their lives regrets hopes and joys as alvin says in the film my brother and i used to look up at the stars well i know they all are with the best view in the house
<START> the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen it was a bad version of 'back to the future' with zero charm once accepted that bill ted are nitwits the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks br br this is a surprise this is your only spoiler warning br br by today's standards this is more fun this was shunned upon release sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time we get the photographer of 'face off' the editor of 'fugitive' a production designer from burton's early work and the sound designer of 'matrix' br br the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep since this was shunned by the fanbase and public the director probably decided the style was too extreme it's not it fits the material like 'death becomes her' and 'catch 22' this dares to be smart but we like our movies simple so we don't buy it probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off what's so good br br nice self reference towards keanu from airhead to messiah see also arnold schwarzenegger br br joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts he makes his own hatred the evil b t and the good robot usses have the same vocabulary as their originals lesser copies and depreciation of language br br the duality motif nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles lots of high and low angles they even use roy brocksmith from 'total recall' to emphasize the point br br the choices motif i don't know where this started in the genre maybe 'ghostbusters' but it's used pretty well here it even boils down to the 7 games against death battleship and club br br film self reference even present in the game against death clue this is smarter than tarantino or brooks notice the premier magazine cover at the end bill and ted the movie ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the 'die hard' and 'lethal weapon' sequels br br i still have some minor nits but nothing compared to the original music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former particularly in the teen market carlin is a great comedian but in these movies he's wasted also for all the daring this effort shows even cracking gay jokes they can't kill a cat br br so despite looking like a nickelodeon production this is incredibly interesting from this movie we got beavis and butt head we're in heaven and we just mugged three people br br final analysis midrange material
<START> alan rudolph is a so so director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right that's the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of seconds br br the shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention br br campbell didn't deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voice over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego played by denis leary
<START> written on the wind was an enormously successful universal picture it could only be done by douglas sirk a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given based on a popular novel by robert wilder and an adaptation by george zuckerman it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama nymphomania a large oil fortune alcoholism incest and a mild touch of homosexuality mr sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre mainly dallas and dynasty just to mention two br br the fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio most of the decor is phony like a lot of those 1950s pictures written on the wind was shot entirely in a studio lot just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in manhattan or miami or even the lake are one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop mr sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way br br we recently caught a screening part of a revival of mr sirk's work where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments especially during the scenes where rock hudson who plays the good mitch wayne appears there is also something graphic in the way that both robert keith who plays the patriarch jasper hadley and later on his own daughter the evil marylee caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk a sort of phallic object d'art br br douglas sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances which makes sense in the way dorothy malone portrays the nymphomaniac marylee and to a certain degree robert stack who overacts as kyle the tormented heir of the story that would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen the only one that seems normal is lauren bacall who wasn't asked to make her lucy moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd br br together with his other hollywood movies written on the wind shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
<START> i had never heard of robert roy macgregor before rob roy came out but the movie is definitely worth seeing playing the title character liam neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to oskar schindler and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary archibald cunningham tim roth is one person very likely to make your skin crawl br br all in all this comes out as good as braveheart maybe even better i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back to back taking a swipe at england very good also starring john hurt eric stoltz brian cox and jason flemyng
<START> i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on it's just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh's character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don't waste your time here
<START> this could be difficult to for some people to get into being used to hollywood production styles the directing is uninspired apparently simply a filming of the stage set up and the audio quality is bad here and there the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices etc br br my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us off it seemed very stagy and cheesy then we picked up on the tone of the content and really started to enjoy ourselves br br it is very funny despite some corniness definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog also helena bonham carter is adorable of course
<START> after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was is this supposed to be irony or not after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series i knew this film was not meant to be ironic so the story tells us about an us american super doc saving a south american republic from evil sounds like a typical story but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous the mandatory end fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example
<START> nicolas roeg he directed the classic supernatural thriller don t look now didn t he strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever br br you see it s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak this doesn t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it s not explained in any great depth in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie br br people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it s impossible not to notice them if i didn t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn t help the movie at all one can t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen br br cheap production values disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
<START> julian noble pierce brosnan is a hit man or a facilitator of fatalities as he prefers to be called he is also a drunk a womaniser and in the middle of a mid life crisis on a job in mexico city he bumps into danny white greg kinnear an unconfident businessman who thinks he's just nailed a recent pitch but is unsure they meet in the hotel bar late one night after they've both had a few too many margaritas br br sounds like the set up for a by the numbers comedy thriller doesn't it but it isn't instead the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances br br brosnan's hit man will inevitably be compared to his bond but this is unfair to both performances bond is a half formed idea a product of all that has gone before while julian is a fully formed character with his own motivations and flaws he has existed in his own shadowy seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being br br when he meets danny in the hotel bar he sees his opposite a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems he envies danny the hit man has become fed up with his life sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable burn out as he puts it but when danny opens up about the death of his only son julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke he is a man who has in his own words been running from any emotion kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan's performance and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm he is the perfect foil to julian while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism danny is down to earth with just a hint of eccentricity but he too goes deeper than his established persona showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin br br there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear it is most visible in the film's three key scenes the hotel bar a bullfight during which julian tells danny what he does for a living and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination and a scene in which julian turns up at danny's house six months later this scene also introduces us properly to danny's wife bean yes bean in another example of how much the matador respects its characters bean hope davis instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house merely asks with forced calm did you bring your gun the script isn't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite one or two lines seem a little forced and a couple of the jokes need a little more work but in the scenes where julian and danny and later bean just talk the writing is superb the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations other than meeting a hit man and said hit man turning up on your doorstep it just lets them talk gently nudging them toward necessary plot points br br there is action but only when it reflects on the characters one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope the rest of the film is about the characters how they interact how they each affect one another and ultimately it is about friendship even in the most unlikely of places at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend and he really means it
<START> i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai all black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting i've seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act plays the plot however isn't a bad premise just poorly implemented it's kind of like a traffic accident though i couldn't seem to turn it off a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i e twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking
<START> i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney that both kids and adults both got into the story folks let me tell you i wasn't disappointed holes is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir now that i've seen the movie i have to read the book most recommended
<START> this is by the far worst piece of cr4p i've ever seen in my life it barely made sense it wasn't scary at all unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming sarah michelle gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horror films i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted shite when the credits rolled up br br on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go br br 1 the return 2 cabin fever 3 silent hill br br the reason i made silent hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes but the rest was absolute cr4p same with cabin fever made no sense but the return topped that list its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
