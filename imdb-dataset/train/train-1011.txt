<START> turkish cinema has a big problem directors aren't interested in global cinema they are local and folkloric but want to be international this brings kitsch results such this movie br br film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non turkish audiences even for turkish audiences after 10 years br br players even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average they act like puppets br br movie was shot in cuba but nothing includes about cuba so cuba is thought like a banana republic br br waste of money waste of time
<START> a patient escapes from a mental hospital killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college next semester the late prof's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings the dialogue is so clichÃ©d it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining skip it and rent girl's nite out instead br br rated r for strong graphic violence profanity brief nudity and sexual situations
<START> beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever 10 10
<START> villa rides 1968 turns out to be something of a big disappointment and even though sam peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay along with robert towne it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished buzz kulik firstly top billed yul brynner as pancho villa is wrong for the part he's not charismatic enough to play the great mexican revolutionary his one note performance lacks the fire and gusto anthony quinn or gilbert roland could have brought to the role brynner simply looks like a russian aristocrat dressed up like a mexican bandit who is in the middle of the mexican revolution instead of the russian one also second billed robert mitchum is totally wasted in the picture his part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one's mind his other mexican revolution picture the far superior bandido 1956 which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on dvd besides lacking any kind of style villa rides also suffers badly without the presence of a female star there is starlet grazia buccella as a young mexican girl who gives mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory someone like claudia cardinale or jean peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line br br there are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive maurice jarre theme tune doesn't help matters br br as is paramount's wont there are no extras not even a trailer yup a disappointing movie and dvd presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better
<START> fast paced funny sexy and spectacular cagney is always terrific blondel charms you with her wit and energy it's obvious that this is a pre censorship film by the innuendo in the script the costumes and the way they touch each other and bikinis before there were bikinis this is no holds barred fun for everyone i don't understand the john garfield issue though does it matter whether or not he's in this film if he is he screen is so short that he's basically a prop you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there i'm a big cagney fan but had never seen this one before i found it on turner classics i found it by wonderful accident sit back and enjoy the ride
<START> it is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the over the top writing of michael o'donoghugh magazine articles and snl skits that were genius for the time and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos thus leading them to mr mikes mondo video br br this movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone the viewer experiences such things as cat diving swimming with the man who thinks he's found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired hula hops pet rocks rainbow dread wigs etc then we enter the music world punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film where d rate bar performer rootboy slim performs boogie till you puke in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music in many different styles with many different instruments the sound of telstar plays and replays for those who don't understand telstar was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph mr mikes seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of sid vicious ex sex pistol not the wrestler singing my way his version is very different than sinatras as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen it's good that is the sad part in the vhs release paul anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1 2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol br br i would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is passÃ© i can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2 5 if you want to see a good o'donoghugh script watch scrooged it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent
<START> i get to the cinema every week or so and regularly check out this site but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a film br br to my all time list of shockingly bad films last man standing spawn the bone collector i can now add the drivel that was 'hollow man' br br from the awful opening titles a ridiculously over long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti through to the insulting finale a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema this film is dismal and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end br br this isn't just my opinion it was that of my friends and everyone around us when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller its clear that the film is hopeless br br not only that it was sick too the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b movie it's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved it hardly makes entertaining cinema br br spoilers follow br br get past the films sick exterior and things are even worse whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man' the rest of them perhaps handicapped by a dire script do an even better job of being hollow cast one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man he's finally snapped shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion this is par for the course and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified guns poised but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts even after he drowns the pentagon chief he drowned in his pool last night reports the same female spectacularly failing to put two and two together br br the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue and the rest is just an a z of film cliches which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end br br the 'eureka' moment at the computer the female undressing at the window the looped security video the list really is endless the predictable disregard for strength in numbers the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices the almost dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes the falling lift which just stops before hitting them and more than anything else the immortality of the bad guy br br the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame thrower electrocuted whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors and then having apparently survived the explosion fireball and total destruction of the labs has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches br br that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one which should be avoided at all costs
<START> ahh yes the all star blockbuster take a so so concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin' special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up then round up the usual suspects hot up and comers has beens wanna be's and never wuzzes and stick 'em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras and hope to gawd that some of them aren't too old to remember their lines br br leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the post exorcist thriller the sentinel novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and one up ira levin's rosemary's baby scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a new york brownstone the result was a controversial best seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic and an equally controversial top heavy star laden vehicle co written and directed by death wish's michael winner but for many unsettlingly different reasons br br cristina raines nashville plays successful model alison parker who is pretty much over stressed and over worked i won't add overpaid i mean she is a model so that would be redundant not just by her 24 7 schedule by also by her insistent 'wanna get married right now' boyfriend michael chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sob i g movie lipstick one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in manhattan which she's able to get dirt cheap that should've been the big red flag cheap real estate in new york from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan golden age screen vet ava gardner fresh from the storm drain in earthquake br br things seem fine at first but ah yes then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde sylvia miles and sandra a very early beverly d'angelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old mr charles chazen a nicely creepy burgess meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with alison's welfare and that's not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants you'll never hear the phrase black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse br br things really start to go downhill when an apparition laden nightmare of alison's morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movie's most underwear staining scares and both alison and michael with some assistance from alison's bff jennifer deborah raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone's dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its other worldly inhabitants not to mention alison's connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidental br br although there's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time arthur kennedy jose ferrer martin balsam eli wallach john carradine and even early appearances by christopher walken jeff goldblum and nana visitor winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a tod browning by enlisting real life physically challenged actors to appear in the sentinel's climactic everything and everybody goes to hell sequence which i guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green pea soup it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live on set makeup and special effects that don't involve cgi which was pretty much non existent back then br br the sentinel has that kitschy late seventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp inducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bump and shriek in the night after all what living single in the big city person hasn't lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is the building settling br br konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel the guardian not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen sigh of relief
<START> the prophecy ii what's there to say about it they've completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply made a chris walken splatter film it's not even written by the original writer br br if you've seen nr 1 don't watch nr 2 it's a real disappointment br br if you haven't seen nr 1 don't watch nr 2 go see nr 1 to experience something original and fun
<START> one of the better vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than michael curtiz this time around a generally hated financier is found dead shot in the head in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor philo vance hearing of the situation while about to set off for italy decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide william powell is as affable a philo vance as you will find he never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does powell is aided by a host of very talented actors some first rate character actors and actresses like mary astor as a niece that hated her uncle ralph morgan as the dead man's secretary paul cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier arthur hohl as a mysterious butler helen vinson as the next door kept blonde and two really good performances by james lee as the chinese cook and portly eugene palette as a wise cracking police detective add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by etienne girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal it is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make the kennel murder case a fast moving fun mystery
<START> zabriskie point 1970 this was especially interesting to me on a personal level since it takes place under identical circumstances with identical peers in my own life Â the counter culture movement of the late 60's early 70's on and off campus we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly woven together one is a young man in los angeles tired of all the endless pseudo revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus and the other a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father employer and take on an establishment job the film is full of our italian director's michelangelo antonioni visual notations of america and the confused psychedelicrazies of that era's self righteous we know it all we'll change everything for the better youth just who is the revolutionary what does that really mean do you dress like one and march around chanting do you fly in under the radar but give advance notice of your arrival do you keep your plans to yourself and go about the business of change with no need for group approval zabriskie point is definitely a period piece full of slang uniforms somewhat surreal film moments after all this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing blow up of 1966 and the era's artifacts but it is more it presents options for cultural revolution and going by antonioni who does seem to be supportive of it the youth are too self involved to see what is needed for radical success because of this it becomes a powerful frightening film that applies to anyone any time any place
<START> despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best dirty harry movie made a film that reflects for better or worse the country's socio political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80's it's also a kickass action movie br br opening with a liberal female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums the scene which prompts the famous go ahead make my day line sudden impact is one non stop roller coaster of an action film the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood it gets only better from there with an over the top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past superb direction and photography and a at times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's
<START> one of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in it ends much to soon than were left looking at the screen like no they didn't lol good performances all around the acting is marvelous with emily blunt simply outstanding i knew she would give a solid convincing performance catching young victoria's regality temper and vulnerability through out the entire movie also the production is outstanding in every way style substance and sensitivity a remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as queen later marrying prince albert than ending with the birth of their first of nine children it had a well written screenplay and flawless editing rupert friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young prince albert vying to win the young queen's attention than securing her love before lord melbourne paul bettany was engrossing to watch just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage victoria and her mother which was fury at times as with her mother and king william whom also disliked her mother the acting and scenes were captivating highly emotional br br i would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era and indeed anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
<START> it does come out of left field and really isn't what you're expecting but i love that the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me if you haven't been tipped off about the mysterious thing that makes these brothers so odd you're in for a treat br br the cast is fantastic but not stretching so much that it's palpable the special effects come out of nowhere seriously it's like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do then wow and they're great the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes the editing and sound are very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clichÃ©s while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster the what the hell factor alone makes it a film treasure br br the people who bash this movie make no sense it's one of those often overlooked flicks of the 90's that you've either never heard of or love so much you jump at the mention of its title br br i'm in the latter group
<START> it's utterly pointless to rate this film it's as if you would condemn or praise the newly born for his future life instead look at it as a powerful meditation at what could have been and what has been in the past 100 years one hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy what has become of the babe i like to contemplate on what would have creatively happen if europe wasn't interrupted devastated twice by the great wars of the xxth century on her ruins the bogus neon castle of the non creative and reactionary circus named hollywood erected itself before 1914 french italian and scandinavian cinemas were leading the way both financially and of course creatively french film in particular was already threading some very original and creative pathways that could have if not interrupted possibly altered the medium history in some unimaginable ways one wonders what the film history would look like today if it wasn't stultified and choked by the mercantile and cheap political agenda of the hollywood's 80 years of what chekhov might define as the reek of greed and harlotry be it as it might please at least become aware of la sortie as the key or at least one of them to the kingdom thus the birthplace of cinema lumiere brothers factory lyon france the date march 19th 1895 there's also a replica reel shoot in the summer of 1895 so if you notice summer lights and the workers' lighter clothing that was the version shown to the very first people who ever saw the moving images louis lumiere creative ideas cinematography direction it was all louis' own domain because auguste took care of the rest money first film reels were all fifty seconds long the camera le cinematograph the cameramen le cinematographer having only paltry fifty seconds to make things happen apparently le institute lumiere has managed to preserve around 1500 of these first films executed mostly by an industrious brigade of loumiere travelling cinematographers criss crossing the globe so all the stars in starry heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history so far
<START> i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it perhaps if i'd seen it in a theater in its original presentation i might have appreciated it but it's far too slow moving for me br br i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory this did not help the film as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events br br this is really four linked films or a film in four parts and was i believe intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation i found part i to be enjoyable enough but it was all i could do to sit through part ii which drags interminably reading tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing if you get a good translation or can read it in the original his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story on film however it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous br br i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw it's very splashy with a lot of hey ma look at this camera work that calls attention to itself instead of serving to advance the story br br clearly i'm missing something but i just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv
<START> several years ago the navy kept a studied distance away from the making of men of honor a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism ever eager to support films showing our navy's best side the u s s nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers with supporting shore installations were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage some of the movie was shot aboard the u s s belleau wood br br antwone fisher wrote the script for denzel washington's director's debut in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating fisher played effectively and deeply by derek luke br br fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the u s s belleau wood lha 3 a front line helicopter assault platform fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men sent to the m d as part of a possible pre separation proceeding fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality br br the story develops as fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest an enlisted sailor named cheryl played by a stunningly beautiful joy bryant br br fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers however painful in order to grow and move away from conflict seeking destructive behavior br br while all the main characters are black this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings viola davis a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom mrs tate novella nelson who in short but searing scenes would earn if it existed the oscar for gut churning brutality br br films about patient therapist interaction follow a certain predictability all that transference and counter transference stuff but the earnestness of fisher and his doctor mentor is realistically gripping it's a good story well told period br br while set in the navy antwone fisher is not in any real sense a service story as was men of honor an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person nor is it truly a film about blacks it's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and as fisher says being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still standing tall the persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor br br my only quibble is that washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander with all the navy support people listed in the end credits someone should have told director washington that his character like all naval officers below the rank of commander is addressed as mister not a big criticism is it br br i don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters it deserves wide distribution derek luke may well get an oscar nomination br br 8 10 br br

<START> for the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters br br the story is amanda lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc she's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy now that was original the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer if you've seen the landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard including a roadie br br much of the idea's came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal the highlight of the movie was amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot top scene somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time br br 4 out of 10
<START> how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was and still is the best document of texas life for the time period consider the following men beat their wives get drunk at bars nightly get married to settle a fight commit adultery and compete on mechanical bulls try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly they dont make them anymore it seems current films are always about people with lots of money they live in huge homes drive expensive cars and don't work this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake br br anyway i watch it at least once a week no kidding i have dissected this movie from end to end feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary consider the following scenes bud sees sissy they are split up he amicably honks and waves she flips him the bird he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off br br buds mom calls him approx 18 hours after he gets into town on a sunday to see if he has a job yet all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid x2 with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him br br you all live like pigs think about why this scene is needed think about it was it necessary could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink god i love that br br sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull only a few days or possibly the next day after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband steve asks hey sissy remember wes oh yeah didnt you beat my husband up the other night so let's get this lesson goin' to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy's many fights which by the way all take place in public in gilley's br br the wedding reception picture taking session oh the humanity could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way my legs are sweatin' momma br br in conclusion you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology it is a documentary of real life br br i only wish there was a director's cut
