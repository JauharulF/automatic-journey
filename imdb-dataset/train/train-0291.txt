<START> a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father all the stock characters are in place the nice couple the funny guy the tough but sensitive hood the smart girl she wears glasses that's how we know the nerd and two no personality blondes it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life don't ask and kills people i knew i was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to 20 years later all bad horror movies do that br br the dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad except for betsy palmer why betsy and the killings are stupid and or unimaginative my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed a real bad stupid incoherent horror film avoid at all costs
<START> i love jack's jokes like 'the clichÃ© is ' or over the top clichÃ© guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniel's starting to catch up on him to good thing jack's not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm mania i just love all the plots season 8 a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i'm starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and teal'c it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it's good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen i'm still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit clichÃ© they can think of arrrrgh br br don johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain br br the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i won't ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a nghya moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like suggest watching this movie together and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it that's a fair price to pay i guess
<START> why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie the cast gives some good performance elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin a guy eternally lessened by his bother but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen julie corman the producer are you crazy
<START> this film is pretty poor the acting is abysmal and completely forced furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily mr dir don't let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes however the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish there is no other way to put it it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere what takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping was that it spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point zero day indeed zzzzzzzzzzzzz
<START> i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly that br br most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose br br the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie
<START> franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal erotic cinema true much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus necronomicon he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work jerry van rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist reynaud who may be schizophrenic or may indeed as one mysterious character states be a devil attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema
<START> spielberg's first dramatic film is no let down it's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an african american woman it also proves that not all movies that have the african american ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an african american director br br what i love about this movie is spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually he's just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as celie you will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie br br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope it's about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed
<START> i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons br br 1 host steve martin was at his most wittiest i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and i'll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle's head in my bed br br 2 surprise winners no one had adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeers and boos but they won br br last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy fellowship was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are i'm sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers br br chris rock wasn't too bad but he's no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats there's no such thing as a minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they're as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves br br best supporting actress cate blanchett no great surprise for a competitive category br br best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of america's greatest living character actors br br best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn br br best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night br br best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one actually i'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or goodfellas he didn't deserve it for the aviator br br best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off br br what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd's sake and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
<START> this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more funny sally field teri hatcher in her hey day kevin klein elisabeth shue robert downey jr it's all these well known quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars producers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how well acted it really is don't expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding man's inner man etc sit back relax and laugh
<START> it just seems to run true to form any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes or that dolph is such a bad actor no spoiler here he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre
<START> it's this one very cool premise right off the bat br br has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credit's due br br has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it looked the only thing was the ghost's relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different br br things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt and the crab spider scene was just not good but then the ending is actually very good sure 'the grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what i liked about this movie comparatively br br please someone one with a tempered style remake this movie br br fans of 'silent rage' would absolutely love this movie
<START> how amazing this film is i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always spellbound by it the reason why the film is so easy to re watch is of course the arresting performance given by the young bette davis she not only steals every scene that she's in but is actually much prettier and better photographed here not to mention sexier than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio warner brothers this film was made by r k o radio pictures she wears a very flattering make up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh those lovely big eyes especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in london's soho her body was so curvy when she was young get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard and oh boy she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene howard is a little too nervous throughout but he does captures the hero's sensitivity frances dee scores as the sweet pretty young sally who truly loves him max steiner's score is both charming and poignant splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
<START> this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me br br a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans br br
<START> this movie is so bad you almost feel contaminated by it actually there is a strong sense of relief when it's over relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would phone in his performance i meant that he would not be trying very hard but lo and behold in a huge number of scenes in this film bill hurt is actually on the phone our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible there is a very slight resemblance to falling down but that film had a boldly disturbing story line great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack contaminated man is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up you get the picture don't get this one
<START> what a dreadful film this is the only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of miss eleniak the painful overacting of mr mcnamara which became embarrassing at times ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast mr mcnamara is no tom cruise the actor he obviously wants to be
<START> i think this show is screamingly funny it's not for every taste and i'm not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don't get it i'm sure they're wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength but if you like it you really like it sarah plays a self infatuated loser named sarah silverman who often finds her self in homerian predicaments that's homerian as in homerian simpsonian br br i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90's i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she's done br br this show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers check it out
<START> home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie focus' on two opposite characters alecia busy phillips and deanna erika christensen alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
<START> in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry capote coined the phrase nonfiction novel to describe the book on which this film is based and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script which he co wrote despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story this is the first problem with the tv remake color changes the tone of the story in addition the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused as a result we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews trial imprisonment and execution so claustrophobic on the small screen it's just another version of law and order spin offs br br hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age usually that's a mistake and this is no exception br br all of the actors are competent the script is ok the directing doesn't get in the way it's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument it doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes at the end of the tv version we are left with the feeling ho hum who cares br br see the original first on as large a screen as you can then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967 br br wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie br br i actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an
<START> as a collector of movie memorabilia i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that i've finally seen it has to be the best thing about it there's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man however there's nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most wishy washy persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable it's incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he melts br br and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling
