<START> let's go straight to the point this is the movie i would take with me on a desert island with dvd player it's just perfect if a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings this movie is for you see the scene when myrtle rowlands come on stage drunk and maurice cassavetes has to improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore if you're sensitive to the camera's movements you'll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage the particular flow that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of private space amazing and the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama cassavetes is again arguing with hollywood and the majors' politics but this time he do it through broadway making one of the most exciting movie about theater well this movie is a bliss
<START> armageddon ppv br br the last ppv of 2006 br br smackdown brand br br match results ahead br br we are starting the show with the inferno match kane v mvp this was an okay match nothing about wrestling here this was about the visuals overall this was not bad there were a few close spots here with kane getting too close to the fire but in the end kane won with ramming mvp into the fire back first br br nice opener let's continue br br teddy long announces a new match for the tag team titles london and kendrick will defend against regal and taylor the hardyz and mnm in a ladder match let's get moving br br match two fatal four way ladder match this was total carnage judging by three out of the four teams here you would expect chaos the spots were amazing a total spot fest one point jeff went for poetry in motion and london moved and jeff hit the ladder shortly afterword jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as mnm were going to kill jeff matt makes the save and jeff hits the see saw shot to joey mercury mercury is hurt his eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way mercury is taken out of the match and nitro is still there he is going to fight alone for the titles regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face first into the ladder jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot dropkicks through the ladder to nail jeff awesome in the end london and kendrick retain the tag team titles what a match br br this was insane i can't figure out why wwe did not announce this till now the buyrate would increase huge i'm sure the replay value will be good though br br mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye he is at the hospital now get well kid br br no way anything else here will top that br br next up the miz v boogeyman ugh this was a nothing match will the boogeyman ever wrestle the miz sucks too after a insane crowd this kills them dead dud br br chris benoit v chavo this was a strong match i enjoyed it chavo hit a killer superplex at one point benoit hit eight german suplexes too benoit wins with the sharpshooter good stuff br br helms v yang cruiserweight title championship match this was a good match unfortunately the stupid fans did not care for this why helms and yang are very talented and wrestled well i agree with jbl he ranted to the crowd jbl is 100 correct learn to appreciate this or get out br br mr kennedy v the undertaker last ride match not too much here this was a slug fest with a few exceptions kennedy at one point tossed taker off the top of the stage to the floor the spot was fine reaction was disappointing the end spot was taker tomb stoned kennedy on the hearse and won the match unreal kennedy needed this win they both worker hard still kennedy needed this win undertaker should have lost creative screwed up again br br a stupid diva thing is next i like women not this at least torrie was not here that's refreshing judging from the crowd layla should have won the wwe wanted ashley consider this your bathroom break next br br main event cena batista v finlay booker t this was also a nothing match the focus was cena v finlay and batista v booker batista and booker can't work well together finlay tries to make cena look good the finish was botched finlay hit batista's knee with a chair shot and batista no sold the shot and finished the match lame not main event caliber at all br br overall armageddon would have scored less but the ladder match was the main event here that was enough money's worth right there a few others were solid br br the last word a good ppv with the ladder match being the savior smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough smackdown needs to stop letting cena tag along let smackdown stand on their own two legs this show proves that smackdown can
<START> a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth gordon br br as an avid columbo fan i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally dawns on him br br the music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones
<START> seriously i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood gore and repulsiveness but what really makes this film disturbing uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women he john cassavetes of rosemary's baby talks about ruptured uterus dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine that being said incubus is an ultimately strange horror effort it isn't necessarily awful Â although it isn't very good neither Â but just plain weird the muddled incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist killer of flesh and blood even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature and it never seems to stop introducing new characters none of these characters especially not the main ones come across as sympathetic and for some never explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter love and continuously behaves like he's a suspect himself the town's sheriff john ireland appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who keeps raping killing the women in his district the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens an old witch and her grandson are just plain spooky all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns' women reproducing organs the sequences building up towards the rapes murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling basically these are very positive factors in a horror film but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for incubus to be a really good film also there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through like footage of a bruce dickinson concert and the usually very reliable john hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable the final shot is effectively nightmarish though for me personally incubus was a bit of a disappointment but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open minded genre fanatics
<START> the rookie is based on the true story of a 40 year old school teacher in big lake texas reaching the majors jimmy morris dennis quaid is a small town high school science teacher and baseball coach his team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph br br after throwing batting practice and a wager is made jim agrees that if his team wins regional's he'll try out for the major leagues the movie tells the story from jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors it is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie dennis quaid makes the movie worth while giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes brian cox rachel griffiths and angus t jones br br the story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end the baseball scenes are fun well filmed and portrayed excellently the movie really isn't about baseball but about one man's quest to reach his dream it's inspiring it's emotional and it's funny i liked it i hope you do br br the rookie starring dennis quaid brian cox rachel griffiths and angus t jones br br 4 out of 5 stars
<START> this was the only time i ever walked out on a movie years later i saw it in the cable listings and thought maybe i should give it another try suffice to say that i was right the first time this ranks second only to godzilla 1998 as the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> minor spoilers as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet hobgoblins stands apart from all others in it's own unique way classic baddies such as the creeping terror the mighty gorga and manos are uniformly bad from start to finish hobgoblins on the other hand starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept club scum sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another with just this one film director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time how bad can a bad movie be watch hobgoblins and wonder no longer
<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england
<START> i was very excited about seeing this film anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of rivers and tides however that's not what i received instead i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim br br the photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed ethical duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images along the periphery and frankly the images were not generally that impressive and according to this artist scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful br br in all respects a stupid film for people who'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it
<START> the movie had a good concept but the execution just didn't live up to it br br what is this concept well story wise it's dirty harry meets m a child killer has begun terrorizing a city the lead detectives dennis hopper and frederic forest have never dealt with a serial killer before the mayor and the police chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things up to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible br br to be fair this film does genuinely have some good things to offer br br besides the concept i liked the look of the killer's hideout norman bates has his basement this guy has an eerie sewer in some of the shots the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls often giving these scenes a creepy dreamlike quality br br the acting was good too dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age br br once you get past that however it more or less goes downhill br br the film is paced way too fast the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating this could have been fixed in two ways either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery br br for an example of how bad this is one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this at one point in his life the suspect went to a pet shop that's right i'm being totally serious here it's like they went from point a the first clue to point z the suspect and skipped over all the in between steps br br then there's the characters the only ones i actually liked were two pick pockets you meet about half way through the movie considering that they're minor characters i'd call that a bad sign br br finally there's the mob angle this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the 3 to buy the dvd in the first place i mean what a hook there's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10 15 years the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest but it didn't br br i figured the gangsters's methods would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time kind of like a vigilante movie or something maybe they'd even throw in some heist movie elements too we are talking about criminals after all instead we're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid the detectives question witnesses what does the mob do they interrogate and kill them it's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they're hunting br br unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest i'd say give this one a miss maybe some day they'll reuse the same story idea and do it right i hope so i hate to see such a good concept go to waste
<START> i'm not a big fan of most anime but gundam wing is truly something else gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits gundam wing gets right down to business br br gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war not only the battles though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements br br to my knowledge this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000 and then professionally dubbed by them too the dubbing is simply flawless not only does every word said match up but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english but i simply don't have the determination to do that br br not only are the voices good but the score used over the series is quite impressive i'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack br br the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers and no not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace thus a war is started leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information which is crucial to the plot br br i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime anyone that thinks all anime is stupid they have good reason to think so and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it
<START> good sequel to murder in a small town in this one cash and his police lt buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a nazi criminal a philanthropic witch and a family of screw ups and their wierdo helpers as in the original the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre war america go see it
<START> one thing is for sure you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense all the characters were ok and wil smith did another good day at the office br br there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant the journey it takes you on is interesting enough if not overwhelming br br a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights
<START> i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary br br i watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so br br it is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family however br br hence for the children a 9 10 from me
<START> yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it that's just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating a very nice family movie with i concede a rather corny happy end but hey it doesn't really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes
<START> as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors anyone who appreciates his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting all of the acting is quite good if you can't take lower manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life not glorified action shoot em ups then this is not a film you would enjoy it is mr fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie
<START> a scientist john carradine sadly finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of marble eventually this all leads to disaster br br boring totally predictable 1940s outing this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now i had to struggle to stay awake with one exception the acting is horrible such expressionless boring actors hopeless br br there are some good things about this carradine despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls there's also one of the worst looking knockouts in cinema history still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid
<START> i grew up on this classic western series and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday evenings to watch it bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs br br the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright family who live on a ranch near virginia city nevada around the civil war era their ranch called the ponderosa is run and defended by the widowed father ben and his unmarried three sons adam hoss and little joe these three brothers have different mothers all of whom have passed away years earlier br br the cartwrights are a hard working prosperous and honourable family highly respected in those parts the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding also trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth needless to say few of these excursions pass uneventfully although hospitable much of the cartwrights' energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation the cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary they are involved in various town affairs even the political life of the nevada territory br br one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present despite occasional disagreements between ben and his three sons and despite frequent disagreements between the three brothers now one brother might beat up another every now and then but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long the characters are all very well drawn ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity the oldest son adam the most rational and suave of the brothers left midway through the series the middle brother hoss is a gentle giant of a teddy bear who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies the youngest little joe is a hot headed handsome charmer who by contrast has quite a way with women this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible for whatever reason br br the actors are all stellar in their roles including pernell roberts adam dan blocker hoss michael landon little joe and of course lorne greene as the principled family patriarch ben i also love the ranch cook hop sing played by victor sen yung br br this is a wonderful action packed western with great values the cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous if only there were more programs like this vintage western on tv these days
<START> darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment i e bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this film's only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out
<START> i was having just about the worst day of my life then i stumbled on this cute film watched it and now i'm ready to go out kiss a streetlamp br br i have to admit i only watched it for 2 reasons vera ellen's legs but it's really so much more the plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven it's almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings and of course there's also vera ellen's legs br br the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased the 100 family classics collection by mill creek entertainment doesn't have the best video quality and i've heard the same about the alpha release the brightness and contrast are a bit too high so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress but i suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your tv set to compensate i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in '51 the stage sets costumes colours are otherwise dazzling delightfully creepy sort of in a cabinet of dr caligari vein br br as far as the romance goes this is just perfect not sappy not contrived not melodramatic just 100 ahhhhhh too bad you poor schmucks your miserable lives will never be as charming as this har har har wait what am i laughing at my life sucks just as bad as yours oh hell time to watch this movie again
