<START> low budget brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before several scenes are a bit hysterical and o'connor's voice sounds a lot like mini mouse she disappeared from sight soon after making this movie so life can imitated art a must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though
<START> this movie to me is about family jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself but for his family i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city chiefs she'd think it was the coolest thing like morris' son did living dreams with the family is what this one is about i think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what jimmy morris did
<START> once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing i just recently reviewed baby face nelson now i've seen dillinger and i've had it br br this movie is garbage i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde this movie is far from a classic someone called it brilliant that's an insane thing to say this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger first of all he looks nothing like him second of all by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31 when oates made this he was 45 you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him not only was he too old but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis br br they show baby face nelson die then homer van meter and finally john dillinger john dillinger was killed before both of them the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson not only do the writers not know when they died but they also don't know how they died baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns homer van meter was cornered by the police in st paul and gunned down with machine guns another member of dillinger's gang harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie pierpont wasn't shot harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here let me also add that richard dreyfuss' portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming leave me alone baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought maybe dillinger didn't agree with nelson's bank robbing methods but they never fought nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten they keep calling him lester baby face nelson he was never in his life known by that name nelson's real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood john milius doesn't know anything where the hell did john milius get his information i could probably make a better movie than him br br finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette by the way billie frechette wasn't even there that night but a girl named polly hamilton was melvin purvis yells 'johnny ' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away they didn't even have to shoot him they were so close that powder burns were found on his face it was murder they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger's death i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger but i'll stop here if you would like to know more check it out here br br see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie
<START> i saw this movie once as a kid on the late late show and fell in love with it br br it took 30 years but i recently did find it on dvd it wasn't cheap either in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the play br br the catalog is around here someplace if you're sincere in finding it fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info cartwrightbride yahoo com
<START> this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years i will sadly miss it although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit br br the last ever episode of sg1 on television anyway was beautifully done robert wrote something that felt close to reality as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs but over the years they've turned into a family i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms br br sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement the wonderful characters stories directors writers from episode one i was hooked the blend of action science drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more br br there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible br br i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to die br br stargate sg1 1997 2007
<START> this movie is not as horrible as most sci fi channel movies i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation however i had thought that i had seen all the possible lows that the sci fi channel could hit then i saw this movie br br imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup those are the main alien vampires in this movie you can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims and the vampire who is on the vampire hunter's team can talk to these rubber sock puppets in transylvanian how did alien vampires learn transylvanian and isn't transylvania in romania so shouldn't they be talking romanian why would some little town have their own language if you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the aliens' heads then you have to deal with the other alien vampires there are the leatherfaces who like to wear the faces of their victims then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack br br finally if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves why does almost every sci fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying abrasive crude or just totally unsympathetic i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win
<START> not to be confused with the madonna film the next best thing the last big thing is a silly campy off the wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called the next big thing which reviews a variety of up and coming artists this low budget indie makes chuck and buck look like a masterpiece fraught with lousy acting poor sets and costuming etc thing has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award pass on this one
<START> this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another f13th take off the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on br br this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers
<START> i know that some films i mean european films that are very bad films are being regarded as great cinema by certain critics only because they're non american i saw the 8 1 imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals don't let this fool you unless you're one of those people that likes mind numbing films like this and call it great art afterwards skip it the film contains one hilarious scene after another a similar italian film popped into my mind the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare i prefer the sound of the sea the problem with these films is that they're not only boring like some other strangely praised films but that they almost play like camp i mean let's face it the acting is horrible i mean soap opera level the story has not one surprise this has been done endless times before connecting several storylines short cuts magnolia playing by heart only much better not one realistic character in it some true freak seeing along the way notice the hilarious zombie like daughter and so on and so on br br as if that's not enough the film is 135 min count it long and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence well this is an insult to cinema and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in another language in this case spanish strange world we live in 3 10
<START> old people show i'm 15 and have been watching the show since i was 12 recoding it onto my sky box everyday from hallmark and bbc 1 i really wish they hadn't cancelled it they didn't even get a proper farewell but what an adventure all those episodes i think i've seen them all and not one comes to mind that i didn't like and enjoy br br its a shame the bbc keep swapping between diagnoses murder and 'murder she wrote' never watched it and don't intend to anyways he characters in diagnoses murder are so in depth and the chemistry between the actors is amazing it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show
<START> this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson br br in japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share br br shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be
<START> if ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone disabled or not to persevere despite the odds and make it even when make it as an expression proper can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth my left foot is it it's a hard film to watch at times seeing the less placid aspects of christy brown's personality emerge in two key scenes one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him made him able to communicate effectively now has announced at a key moment the inauguration of brown's art she is about to marry another man is tough very very tough more so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how via screams shrieks and profanities aimed at hurting himself however this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account but that of a man overcoming his severe disability becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world daniel day lewis won an oscar for his powerful unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious christy brown and brenda fricker did so as well for her supporting role as brown's solid mother
<START> this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this the cheesy acting the poorly written script the good ol' boys the ridiculous yet somehow obvious clichÃ© and banal premise the riding in pickup trucks with your propped up wife corpse it has it all br br you will meet familiar characters gold digging hussy stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own friends who know better daddy who knows better but drives son away and the wife corpse propped up in a pick up br br wow and the title several things in our lives have been texas tragedies since watching this beauty everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal
<START> i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme basically three welsh guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding and a complete disregard masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety they have had puking eating pubes covered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping snoring stunts in a work place e g army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce the british one who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho mike locke who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
<START> prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes' what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape Â two of the greatest themes in horror cinema with such examples as the chair waldermar korzeniowsky 1988 the green mile frank darabont 1999 alien 3 david fincher 1992 and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised or at least that's what you'd have thought prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be br br the film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened however it's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death and boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes i won't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands br br besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it it's cast headlining we have lord of the rings peter jackson 2001 2003 star viggo mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his eastwood esquire character is both bad to the bone and likable a very delicate mix add him to a cast of 'hey wait a minute i know that guy' actors and you've got yourself one great set of stars the characters themselves however lack three dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical we've got a black oculist a hard as nails prison warden a human rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters but in all honesty this 'fault' actually aids the film instead of boring character development in an over long equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on there's not a single scene that's a filler Â it's balls to the wall plot unlike a certain shawshank redemption frank darabont 1994 sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol' slasher genre tradition prison punishes those who have been bad br br all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans don't be fooled into thinking it'll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in usa 1980s it's far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly done br br i give it 3 5 out of 5 luvs a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
<START> anyone familiar with my reviews on the internet movie database will know that i can be a grumpy bastard from time to time there are a lot of films i don't like which for some unfathomable reason i've felt the urge to review however if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film i've ever seen look no further than transylvania 6 5000 without question this takes the title of the all time no 1 awful film i can't believe that i actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish br br it is clearly meant to capture the flavour of mel brooks's young frankenstein but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material jeff goldblum and ed begley jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day transylvania perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud during their research they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites such as vampires werewolves and mummies br br anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom it marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way it results in awesomely dire entertainment
<START> there's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart having just said goodbye to my new fiancÃ©e of oh one day for an unknown period of time i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see br br i watched a few movies and tv shows but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen for that i have this movie to thank br br being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand i was sure i was going to like it anyway but i didn't just like it i loved it br br the technical mastery is astounding how did they do it how did they capture the animals in the way they did it's just wonderful br br the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous it's a happy sad one again it caught me a bit off guard as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left br br but for those few hours on the plane i was happy to see something new and original and that's life sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable around but the great outdoors holds many a mystery so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open i'm going to explore it observe it and embrace it that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie nature doc too 8 10 br br p s it's two months on from the plane journey we still don't know when we'll see each other again but we will
<START> once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur penn's film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film the 1967 version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better could it possibly be worse
<START> how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i can't get it it was awful very baldy played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i won't talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money
<START> this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best obviously he did this crap for the pay check dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man what he doesn't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie they expect to be entertained not bored to tears it's sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him i don't understand why talented people can't get a grip on the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies if you're going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny this wasn't shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum too full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy surely phil silvers is rolling over in his grave
