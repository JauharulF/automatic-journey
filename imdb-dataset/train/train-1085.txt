<START> 'soapdish' is one of the best yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's the film revolves around the various off camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic a list cast 'soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era br br the film is superbly led by sally field as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like gloria f cking swanson her supporting cast reads like a who's who of 90's movie greats whoopi goldberg robert downey jr teri hatcher kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly goldberg is predictably excellent whilst downey jr 's and hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve br br in terms of writing the film is outstanding there is a really modern edge to the script which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time in some ways the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'high anxiety' 1977 much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing but pretty accurate representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors for example the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher is both hilarious and honest br br 'soapdish' is for my money one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's it's excellent script and a class cast make it a must see it's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes
<START> jackie chan's police story is a landmark film for both the honk kong action genre and the career of jackie chan br br directed written by chan police story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre and like most of the the films of police storys' kind the script is nothing to be raved about but the plot of the film is jackie chan who plays a nice guy cop struggling to convict the local gang lord br br the direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that jackie chan has given us that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece miracles however the job that jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable the standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes br br the performances in this film also vary with jackie giving a very solid typical chan nice guy up against it role but this is by no means his best acting role that can been seen in the sammo hung directed film heart of the dragon the other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as jackie with bridgete lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well but neither does she display full acting potential the standout acting comes from maggie cheung as jackies' suffering girlfriend and bill tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief none of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film br br the action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised modern setting the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera to begin with there is a shootout in the slum where koo ganglord is making a drug deal whilst being no john woo style sequence this serves as a nice starter for the film this is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight this is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by bad boys 2 in the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as jackie tries to transport bridgete lin from her house to his this is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films this sequence is fantastically choreographed timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene however as tradition dictates the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film this sequence displays some of chans' best choreography stunts and camera editing work this sequence is now famous for two things the amount of people sent through high density glass which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people and the stunt at the end where jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof this has to be seen to be believed whilst the two for mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is chans' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography that for me has never been bettered i also believe that the action in police story is some of the best filmed and edited action of chans career helping to set the action apart from others br br overall police story despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding is one of the best action films of all time displaying chans best choreography best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone afterall we watch a chan movie for the action
<START> bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife the midget in this film is hilarious a lot of freaks plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion the story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you watch br br usually i'd score bore flicks like this one low but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points
<START> a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods this is simply not true prior to the construction of interstate 64 which bypasses the ocean view area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view once the interstate was completed ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg meanwhile in the past few years the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought after location for construction of high end housing br br it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film rollercoaster this is also untrue footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to death of ocean view park br br as to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for b grade movies of the time with the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors i don't believe this film was intended to be another citizen kane i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into apparently not a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise br br for the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film except for diana canova fans but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk the first harborfest and old dominion university even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome
<START> i have seen maslin beach a couple of times both on free to air tv in brisbane i won't go into whether it is good bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this br br i will say that it is so australian only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born and to view it on free commercial television br br i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country sex and the city and huff are just too examples br br despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie
<START> reportedy based on actual historical events this disturbingly violent bloody and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era ms bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences her witnessing of the hated local duke's casual rapist activity her forbidden love affair with a jew her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed anthony corlan there are some painfully realistic gory sequences human flaying in this film that are not for the squeamish but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest deserves to be seen if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world
<START> personally while i'm able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie cutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually shutting off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily and i'm usually not very good at this the actors were horrible i've seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all wrong br br this movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
<START> robert jannuci luca venantini venantino venantini alicia moro two stars are from city of the living dead i wonder what luca is doing these days probably a lawyer or something like bela lugosi jr or david hennessey there kid from dark shadows who wants to forget dark shadows existed anyway in the thorn emi video there's no music over the opening credits but the music is great once it comes in with the italian movies the films aren't as good as the music my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following loner alien through the desert alien says why are you following me tommy answers because i feel like it alien replies which way are you headed tommy says west then alien says well i'm going east so after a while of walking the theme playing in the background alien looks up and sees tommy sitting on a rock petting a pet hamster tommy looks up and says to alien what took you so long i love this movie it touches my heart the boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and alien is drafted in to being tommy's daddy in the desert oh yeah they need water too not the road warrior mad max 2 by any means but a silly western post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and alien and trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and crazy bull who looks like wez in the road warrior on sunday afternoons on channel 57 philadelphia pa after church i'd come home and find this on often too often love it 10 10
<START> i watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets that's a mullet every 5 minutes seriously though this film is living proof that formula works if it ain't broke it don't need fixin a streetwise yet vulnerable heroine a hardened ex cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'issues' pure magic

<START> superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit absurdness and serbian mentality movie is a great comedy enjoyable interesting unpredictable best point in a film characters then humor itself story and dialogs humor has 'inner development' rare in serbian movies so it is consequence of characterization is well motivated spontaneous and cogent also it is sharp intelligent and lucid most of the movies unfortunately had constructed humor devise a joke and put it into a characters's mouth or ordinary situation comedy burlesque farce some of the 'art immortality' are incorporated in this movie little masterpiece hardly reachable
<START> a famous orchestra conductor daniel dareus suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert suddenly we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before since he left so young and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona he has bought the old school building where he plans to stay the building needs a lot of work one would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode but no daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way br br the local pastor stig whose church has a small choir comes calling to see if he can interest daniel in helping but the conductor has no desire to go back to music daniel begins to explore his new universe the town's people leave him alone he makes an impression on lena who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies little by little he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir lena will ultimately fall in love with daniel br br at first the relationship between daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected as they get to know him better they come around to accept him and make him one of them his new position doesn't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge the members of the choir are a motley crew but they realize the change daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs the new piece composed for gabriella a battered wife makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers br br daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with stig's own the vicar suddenly begins seeing daniel in a new light he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife siv his ideas clash with the dogma as siv points to him stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of daniel by firing him as the head of the choir br br the choir which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to austria daniel who by now has fallen totally for lena has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship daniel who is late for his own concert gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them br br kay pollak the director of this enormously appealing film shows he was the man to direct it the story involves the viewer from the start great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together william nykvist who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film frida hallgren niklas falk ylva loof do excellent work for mr pollak br br stefan nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears harald gunnar paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty
<START> this movie was a horrible excuse for a movie first of all the casting could have been better katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom br br also the plot was pathedic it was extremely clichÃ© and predictable the ending was very disappointing and cheesy but thats all i'll say about that br br the nail in the bag though was a scene when katelyn jordan hinson was supposed to be crying but the girl couldn't cry on command there were no tears streaming down her face just a few unbelievable sobs she is not a dynamic actress at all she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire sp thats when the movie went from not so good to just plain bad it really looked like she was acting br br in a nutshell this movie was really bad it was kind of a mix of every clichÃ© kid movie from the 1990's that everyone's sick of only worse br br i give it an 'f' because it was just so darn hard to sit through b t w i was babysitting when i saw it br br however you may like it if your 9 or under
<START> without question the worst elvis film ever made the movie portrays all indians as drunk stupid and lazy watch elvis's skin change color throughout the film
<START> it is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age this is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film i was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth iwill never forget it i thought it was the most horrible movie ever made i then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified br br i am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but i did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie i love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty rent some rus myer instead
<START> if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss first boy girlfriend or first puppy love fling this film is for you ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a dominican i loved it there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father the youngest son being babied and bathed with a cafe bustelo tin sooo dominican judy being harassed by the neighborhood men going to church and lighting a prayer candle the film's brilliance was in those small details granted it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture tip make new friends instead more of a bitter sweet faux cumentery this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously as in the tradition of y tu mama tambien this was simply one boy's coming of age tale i recommend it especialmente si eres dominicano o
<START> wow uhm well wow i guess i'll start with the plot a betrothed woman lucy arrives at the family home of her would be husband mathurin in france where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them to satisfy a will while waiting young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who roamed the grounds centuries before in bed that night she begins fantasizing about the beast and his rape turned consensual tryst with the former lady of the house that's where it gets interesting the plot is really pretty thin and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick but the filmmaker rewards those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale br br this movie isn't for everyone if you're looking for great cinema look elsewhere if you're looking for a far out movie about bestiality that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject this movie is for you if you have a weak stomach don't be afraid of this one outside of some horse on horse action at the beginning the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish imo
<START> the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as inexplicably footage from another uli lommel suzanna love film brainwaves it is framed with some more current from the early 90's anyway footage that is boring poorly acted and cheaply shot not only is the film almost completely flashbacks they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film so you see the recycled footage over and over again as if you hadn't seen it already as if the originals weren't bad enough i've never seen a movie so padded someone was milking the last dollar out of these films total ripoff and talk about padding why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash if i can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines that should be enough
<START> this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek but is different in its less cartoony feel despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different animals you know the outcome but you can't help being drawn in br br the characters themselves are far more than their voices the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices unlike most disney movies they are well rounded and completely believable strangely the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think br br the animation is brilliant as you would expect and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie you will fall in love with the characters especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise especially the sloth toy only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related br br which strangely makes the movie all the more pure br br better than monsters inc or shrek
<START> i remember casper comic books but don't remember any cartoons maybe they weren't memorable i don't know but at my advanced age here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday afterward i was shocked to read the user comments here did people miss the ending br br i have to learn all over again that casper isn't like the other ghosts who like to go out each night and scare the c p out of everyone he sees no future in that according to the narrator here instead one night he goes out to the rural section of town inadvertently scares some animals and can't find any friends it brings him to tears until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him the two become buddies but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress br br other reviews have all mentioned what happens so i'll touch on that too the fox is killed by hunting dogs not shown and casper is in tears for losing the only friend i ever had but nobody mentions the happy ending to this story ferdie the fox becomes a spirit figure like casper jumps on his lap licks his face and the narrator comments they lived happily ever after both characters look overjoyed br br what is so sad about that this is a nice story with a nice happy ending
