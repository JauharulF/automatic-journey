<START> the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume can somebody please pass the ketchup i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative it works better than an overdose of demarol
<START> five years after the original creepshow another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a romero and stephen king creepshow 2 this time there are only three stories instead of five none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either the first story is a horror staple formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners the effects are really neat in this story but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners the second story the raft is a stephen king story it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason however instead of being suspenseful the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey headed behavior preventing us from really caring about what happens next there is also some unintentional humor in this segment the third and final story is the hitch hiker which is actually a retread re adapted for creepshow 2 the original story by lucille fletcher was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens the hitch hiker works the best out of these three offerings but it's not without its problems either lois chiles plays a cheating spouse who ends up running over a hitch hiker or so she thinks however we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her as in many average stories of this type the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place tom savini appears as the creep in this installment the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> sure it had some of the makings of a good film the storyline is good if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn't understand why olivia d'abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the wardrobe i know as rule the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self respecting european but this was beyond that anna's colour combinations were positively ghastly and that potato sack like sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible how many school teachers walk around in prada but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste a word to the wise
<START> this is one of those movies that i've seen so many times that i can quote most of it some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose br br i don't know how many times i have seen this sequence but it's funny every time from the moment arthur gets to susan's dad's place to the bit with the moose you pretty much laugh the whole time i remember watching the out takes regarding the bit with the moose it went down just like i'd imagined it'd be like they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it br br the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this his demeanor his one liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious it's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little i laugh every time i listen to the i'm going to have a bath and the lines that follow
<START> the summer of 1979 when this flick was a staple on that new movie medium called hbo was gas line summer iranian hostage crisis summer a change of mood was about to end low budget loner on a mission car films although smokey the bandit kept need for speed flicks going as live action roadrunner cartoons for a few more years corvette summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like vanishing point or dirty mary crazy larry if lighter sexier than most just graduated high school automotive genius kenneth hamill hitchhikes to vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his shop class masterpiece a super custom right hand drive vette in the spiritual limbo of the i 15 desert see fear loathing in las vegas he gets into a custom van yes this was the tail end of the van craze too tricked out as a mobile bordello driven by sassy aspiring hooker vanessa potts on her way to sin city to make her well whatever it is ambitious hookers make vanessa get it shy innocent kenneth is in way over his head in vegas with only his all american resolve his new friend to help him although the hard edged young call girl is predictably less world wise than she first seems why in the i am woman age vanessa invested her talents money future in the world's oldest but least dignified profession over say college or even hairdressing can be explained by young men who'd like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path remember the target audience right hamill is a good choice for the whitebread kenneth the car doesn't even belong to him personally but to his school who won't be deterred from his goal by violence money or even love until he finds out why the car was really stolen potts acts with style energy but vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into the bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always fine brion james but there's not much action this isn't the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog plot twists or heavy themes you could always reach up turn the tv dial plug in your pong console the similar but meaner chris mitchum vehicle stingray which appeared at about the same time featured lamer acting but more skin speed mayhem the best features of each film might have produced a vette movie worth remembering thus the trans am was left to rule the box office muscle car showroom another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by speed channel's fine weekend series lost drive in
<START> jiÃ¸Ã­ trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia the elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment
<START> a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don't like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing and they weren't even part of the main movie br br first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn't really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame br br second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess br br if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
<START> shlock merchant leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy barely coherent horror br br a wimpy orlando bloom type called ilias from some society vaguely resembling ancient greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress wackiness ensues the sorceress is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself she sends various minions each weirder than the last after our heroes who win through in the end striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere this movie contains a steady stream of wtf elements and moments br br for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks either way it failed there is no atmosphere unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks the wolf man minions look like a poor man's wookie for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion six million dollar man style toward our heroes when they attack there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time the other minions of the topless sorceress other than the generic leather clad humans are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay hispanic lisping daleks the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful oh yeah the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used br br ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable he also looks a complete wuss especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair and is clearly a moron sure he's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero mace when he meets ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies traipsing the misty hills together mace promises to take ilias with him in return for bow related favours ilias asks where he is going wherever my legs take me is his reply good enough for ilias mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals he is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason not long after they meet he is testing out ilias' bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman minding his own business walking along and mace shoots him dead there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even ilias who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society doesn't even raise an eyebrow br br the films villainess is quite unusual for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head it's like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t a quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute she spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like ilias wow such symbolism later on in the movie she wimps out when she can't beat ilias and mace and promises to make herself the sex slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her hardly the world's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women's rights i think he sic's the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates mace in a situation where there is no no one else around but mace to fool was he really worthy trading your self respect for ocron br br there are quite a few other wtf moments most of them come toward the end of the movie ilias wusses out i forget why possibly his permed hairdo got mussed but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid mace in fighting the forces of evil all of a sudden for no reason his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy the bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured mace br br the climax is also rather nonsensical mace decimates ocron's remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability he then is able to shoot ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity she starts dying her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head she staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog mace smiles roll credits br br strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused any one who has seen wizards of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be
<START> if you a purist don't waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart granger deborah kerr version i've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison doody again i'm a huge indiana jones fan patrick swayze is good as quatermain and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed
<START> homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets br br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless that is goddard bolt's lesson br br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they're survivors bolt isn't he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight kill or be killed br br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money br br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others
<START> words can hardly describe it so i'll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled br br rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles br br as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old
<START> 1 2 out of while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts however this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children i rate it on a relative basis the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort and jostling back 'n forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons if i had children this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in as the snow fort wowed me when i was young and i think even children today would agree albeit with pixar and all the computer animation maybe i am out of date and just don't realize it in addition the movie's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that for children and adults alike
<START> first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a wrinkle in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all in fact meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series i would suggest skipping this movie
<START> direction must be the problem here i recently heard john cleese speaking of working a skit for fawlty towers he was supposed to attack his car with a branch the first branch was too flimsy and not funny the second branch was too stiff to be funny the third was just flimsy enough to be funny this sort of attention to detail is missing from corky romano no matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was it wasn't fixed and wasn't left on the cutting room floor the one value i can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired br br i've scanned dozens of other reviews here the number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles i can't fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4 max i mean come on 5 is average i can't imagine anyone even those making money off of this rating it even as much as average br br this makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time and hey i actually like the three stooges and can even tolerate ed wood
<START> these writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish br br i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks br br this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats almost every day and trust me it's not scary it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too br br the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish
<START> i rate this 10 out of 10 why br br it offers insight into something i barely understand the surfers surf because it's all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing it's a lifetime for these guys buried in the movie is a great history of surfing i have never surfed but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did the movie was very well edited it flowed well the interviews were outstanding it's interesting from start to finish br br in summary it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so 10 10
<START> with few exceptions most of george bernard shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days too arch too talky appears to be the general verdict this bbc version of one of shaw's funniest plays doesn't refute that verdict it is certainly arch and talky but it is also wonderful and because of the quality of british theater it is perfectly cast with actors whom with the exception of helena bonham carter most of us have probably never heard of carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional chocolate soldier pip torrens and later falls in love with him one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius patrick ryecart the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy's lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns however the role invites over acting and ryecart was obviously told to over act the other players are letter perfect carter as the self dramatizing bulgarian aristocrat and torrens as the swiss soldier of fortune are at the play's center of course and they are wonderful yes arms and the man comes across as a filmed play but you're unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn't betray its origin the plots are generally clever however shaw is all about the dialog the action is minimal even in st joan and the sets are immaterial enjoy this for what it is
<START> wow what a whirlwind the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine especially during the early talkies phase there were movies which are painfully static and dull like dracula with bella lugosi and there were those that just don't give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity lloyd bacon who also directed 42nd street must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it there mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking it's completely crazy i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think the characters seemed to just running to and fro places talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in 42nd street ruby keeler and 42nd street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it and you know what it happened the same thing with footlight parade the ending is absolutely incredible it has become hands down the most impressive musical i have ever seen the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth the numbers are flawless there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache
<START> ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn't really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy br br one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening br br okay the acting in the film isn't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker you've done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one
<START> tom is listening to one of those old time radio broadcasts something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv however they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment from comedies to music to scary stories from the radio br br tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the phantom he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying such as hair standing on end icy chills race down her spine her heart beats in her throat etc jerry meanwhile is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy cat antics br br we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure if the cat asks for trouble that's one thing but when he's minding own business and jerry is physically and in this case mentally abusing him i have a hard time rooting for the little guy br br these early t m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed sometimes that one minute makes a difference it did here as this actually dragged for awhile it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long that's usual for tom and jerry's usually they are much faster paced
