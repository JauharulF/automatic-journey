<START> the usual cat and mouse antics abound until jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink he gets the bright idea of torturing tom without him knowing the cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him 'see' jerry even if it's not fool proof of course jerry gets butch aka killer aka spike the dog into the act even if it's late in the short and his contribution is minimal indeed brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares tom so badly most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be this hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry br br my grade b
<START> i saw this movie once and i thought it was ok then my friends at work said watch it again it's better so i did and to my surprise it was worse on the second time there's a word limit so i'm going to get the ball rolling here br br the bombing scenes were all so stupid why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion none of the characters here are even remotely likable not on the first time not even the second br br oh and last time i checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire that huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher did the above 3 10 viewers actually watch the movie the camera is so shaky i can barely tell what is going on that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off put the rest of the movie was not much better br br the sniper scene the mcmanus brothers from the boondock saints would roll their eyes it was so stupid first off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot furthermore why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullets reloading aiming and not get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him sas types running instead of staying and fighting back huh are the soldiers gay i didn't mean to sound homophobic but honestly that scene was so ridiculous br br too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it bigelow seems to think that the more action the better looks like she is wrong the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot i know watchmen is longer at 163 minutes but at least that movie didn't drag this movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer br br the only good thing was renner who was satisfactory at best but do yourself a favour just skip this and don't give into the hype
<START> my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too br br i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa clause movies three and gulp still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disney's santa clause franchise save the occasionally crude humor and santa's little helper wearing a short skirt fred claus is a one joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes sure jolly ol' saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there br br it's a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical snob but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never aging santa paul giamatti who invites his good ol' brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an efficiency expert kevin spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down hah and guess who plays santa's mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is santa's helper charlene john michael higgins is one of the elves and rachel wiesz plays fred's girlfriend si don't know if i'd praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but they're given way too little to work with br br as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger clinton and frank stallone but the giggles begin and end there worse still the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can br br rating out of 5
<START> i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 4 5 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film br br all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory br br i won't give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95 of the hollywood crap especially children's films out there br br cheers br br p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks
<START> the plot character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak quite a waste of time the conclusion of saving grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles there was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible the drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life the plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time
<START> if you haven't seen the gong show tv series then you won't like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie br br i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems br br 1 it's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in the late 1970's and early 1980's 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show 3 it's interesting to see chuck the host when he isn't doing his on air tv personality 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show br br i won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them but here's a few of the most prominent br br 1 the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length 2 the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness br br it's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad but even then it's not so good either
<START> in one of her first movies romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18 learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony kitschy and campy though surprisingly faithful to the real events this romantic piece is irresistible seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm on that front one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen but then one remembers that in 1954 austria was still under occupation by allied troops including british ones maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film
<START> i saw shiner on dvd while i was watching it i thought this is a really bad porn flick without the porn i also thought whoever wrote this has some real issues then i watched the director writer carlson explain his process as a special feature yeah it was real special br br the emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off they are marginally attractive there is frontal and full nudity these factors probably account for the film being seen at all br br the most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants the two drunken losers not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view but the acting is horrendously bad br br then there's the boxer stalker theme this is really insane not just absurd this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma's boy who works at his gym's parking lot this is in la mind you the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker's house strips in front of him and gets excited in the process br br well all i can say is why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense and i'm afraid some psycho dynamics actually do make sense if you take the time to read about them however bad scripts seldom make sense at all br br the director writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community well he may be correct i suppose we may never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store the only two places they could possibly find this turkey thank goodness for that
<START> for the initial 20 minutes or so i was watching it on a ps2 so i've really no idea how long it took alienator sets up an interesting premise i don't think i've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before however interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the 'alien' is a huge body builder woman in a steel bikini yes alienator is patently ridiculous br br don't think i hold that against it in the world of shlock horror patently ridiculous can often be a good sign however the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it alienator is funny as hell but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set pieces by the time the movie's finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it br br add to this the fact that the 'alien' just kills people by vaporising them as opposed to doing any 'slashing' as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot you'll laugh at alienator but at it not with it if that's your thing then go ahead and check it out
<START> considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign i would have expected something to be worth the fuzz from the opening scene on in which the two brothers sensually caress each other laying naked in a bed it goes rapidly downwards nothing to get the attention not a mind catching thing in the whole plot baaad baad acting a few minor exceptions but artificiality is at its best incest and lesbianism are promising themes but the script analyses none of the two in depth mind that a possible excuse of the makers saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing the too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene at this point that could have saved some of the movie so you can imagine how bad it is many other things could be said but please watch the movie yourselves i am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1 2h of their lives like i did
<START> in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened br br one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co stars and does a semi decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can re create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future
<START> somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school who ever told him he knew how to make a movie can just anybody make movies these days in the past it always required talent before someone could make a movie after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lame all this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer other than the names of the victims and the killer that's it where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term btk because of the fame it has achieved absolutely pitiful the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame dahmer movie that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous whoever made that one needs to be shot
<START> i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one altman's touch with zooms in and out were there and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations unfortunately as far as i could see they sometimes were gratuitous sometimes witty often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection in particular two zoom outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed to be fair though a few zooms outs and ins to branagh heightened his character's increasing bewilderment a la pudgy mccabe's or philip marlow's on the whole the zooms were well inconsistent and sometimes even trite br br other almanesque devices such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge car windshields house windows and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently i felt harking back to the player and even the long goodbye a few catchy jump cuts especially to a suggestive tv commercial reminded me of such usage in short cuts to sardonic effect br br but finally the mismatch between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham genre momentum failed to excite me this director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways this time around the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre was he muzzled in by mammonist producers perhaps or am i missing something due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here br br nonetheless the casting was excellent all around tom berenger for his terrifying ferality branagh for his deflated hubris robert downey jr's pheromonal haze robert duvall's method of trash and davidtz's lurking femme fatality were near perfect choices all and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of brunette daryl hannah accents were convincingly southern br br suspense and mood were engrossing even if the story didn't quite rivet viewers the moodiness of a coastal pre hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely painstakingly rendered i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto br br torn in the end i judged it a 7 br br
<START> this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it i don't normally rent movies like these ie indie flicks however i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy whom i have loved since the scream trilogy the movie director took a risk and it is a risky risk in telling the lives of many and i mean many different people and having the intertwine at various intervals taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film br br the film has a few main characters dwight jamie kennedy a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument wallace gregory john carroll lynch an airplane loader technician who has a love for all living things except perhaps meter maids and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck cyr brian cox the owner of a chinese restaurant donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant cook sung alexis cruz under pressure to keep up with his phobia ernie christopher bauer is married to olive christina kirk who he is convinced is trying to stop him have fun look ridiculous go insane and not live a normal life they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie gordon grant heslov is a man whose life isn't going very well as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand mitchel jon huertas is convinced that gwen alexandra westcourt is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other though she is more skeptical he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts johnston michael hitchcock has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider he takes another job that he just isn't suited for his wife annelle arabella field is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasn't quite the loving husband she thought he was br br all in all i definitely suggest this movie br br erica
<START> any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story it's annoying those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first and the story simply tacked on for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion br br the story in comet over broadway doesn't just jump through hoops it's a three ring circus it's so ludicrous so ill conceived so disingenuous that if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through br br the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion so in the end there's no point to the story the theme becomes irrelevant and as is often the case with poor screenplays the acting doesn't save a thing
<START> this is not horror as the first part was this is campy light and humorous entertainment like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations but there's boobs so i don't complain and real boobs that is if i understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u s of a which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela bruce's sister springsteen br br this cannot be thought without the first movie so i compare this to it again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in again there is really strange characters this time even more visibly pathological ones especially the personnel of the camp it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp people are older most of the actors must be at least 25 but i think they're supposed to be 16 or something some methods used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way
<START> im watching it now on pink serbia tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this series br br this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the series br br some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifi br br the film was the bomb the series suck
<START> this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies eighties such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by blier br br however i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles
<START> i thought the movie especially the plot needs a lot of work the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie br br first when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history yet instead the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied which frustrated and put me in dismay br br second which really bothered me is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival which they did not explain or go in depth they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake the moon lady the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising but one day all ten suns rose up drying up the land with the rising intense heat so the divine archer hou yi shot nine of the ten suns leaving only one sun there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns because of his heroic contribution he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again but his wife chang o stole it after stealing it she fled to the moon where she met a hare she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth giving everyone immortality there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood i most of the time heard about this version i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese oriented br br the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terra cotta warriors the life like statues of the soldiers went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese the terra cotta warrors serves as a connection of china's past and it was very westernized where evil must be killed in anyway possible that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection it would be understandable if wendy considering she is chinese american and doesn't have full chinese knowledge had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts br br the whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight i mean it's rated tvpg due to violence which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence br br all in all all of or either of the producer writer or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information however i would give it credit 2 stars for removing one stereotype of asians and asian americans of being smart and quiet
<START> slow but beautifully mounted story of the american revolution griffith's story telling seems a lot less heavy handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action lionel barrymore is an utter swine neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is well carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama br br note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes however the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours br br far better in terms of story telling than sound versions such as the patriot while not quite in the league of griffith's best such as way down east and broken blossoms an excellent way to spend a couple of hours
