<START> first of all i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven't seen taking this into account i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for gigli my boss's daughter and any other piece of junk you've ever seen belyt must be out of his mind i've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there's any other way a person could figure this crap out br br for the love of g d stay away
<START> boring and appallingly acted summer pheonix she sounded more asian than jewish some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century what on earth fine actors like ian holm anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me
<START> many things become clear when watching this film 1 the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy crewson are so so but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish the other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i'm a babe but i'm really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat 2 the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing 3 robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing acted by tom hanks 4 the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice we are all special friends 5 the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and 5 this is a really bad movie expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed
<START> one richard pryor and jackie gleason two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid they've both sold themselves out in this one worse than pryor's character two horrible overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched three choice of a black actor as the toy the racial subtext of this is unbearable as its never addressed there's no message here pryor's part could have been played by any comedic actor four that kid i wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting that would mean movies like this one and kid co might not have been made and my childhood would have been free of their mind warping power so if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick go ahead if you want to see them in something good see pryor's old standup act and gleason in something better like the honeymooners
<START> there aren't enough gay themed movies and there aren't enough coming out' movies every one is a welcome addition to the genre although the production values are high the movie looks' good matthias freihof philipp looks real good in a pair of jeans this is a bad one it is a period piece gay life under an oppressive regime east berlin 1989 a life that seems 40 years behind the west in a way we're seeing our own history what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here it often reminded me of last exit to brooklyn the book not the film but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random yes it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes life behind the curtain' was hard for gay people a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming out movies and not one of the misses
<START> let's see i'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearer br br i know the performances were no that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hershey br br oh how 'bout the story nope that isn't gonna fly either as it was doze inducing what was the genre anyway it wasn't funny that rules out comedy it wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow i have to ask as i can't be sure let's just call it losers in like i'm sure those behind this film started with a vision i mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but i need help finding it br br even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story i couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy fluffy stupid hair speaking of hair are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hershey br br what am i doing i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie i cannot devote any more time to this loser
<START> people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i laughed br br only once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14 br br and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be br br taken seriously there were quite a few scenes that were meant br br to be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at br br them br br i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love br br and try to take it seriously i think you'll find that despite a few silly br br flaws it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen
<START> i loved this show from it's first airing and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week the plot characters writing special affects were outstanding then the sci fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining well written show i say bring it back i know all of the actors would come back i would suggest buying the dvd's i am i hope the sci fi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers i only watch one show on that channel now ghost hunters but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too
<START> i've been reading posts here concerning wonder woman's costume for this tv movie it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit the producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer's conception of ww for the early seventies br br as for the movie itself i have to agree with many of the other posters here snoozefest i was a kid when it appeared on abc in 1974 so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero yet i was so engrossed with the plot i stopped watching it three quarters into the movie br br of course i wasn't at the right age to appreciate cathy lee
<START> quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time the plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time br br to make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue maybe not a bad thing then and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board's promotional video br br oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done better lighting next time please
<START> the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs jewelry guns and money some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids honestly this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man what is the second part of their master plan once they have his stuff they'll sit around and get high again great plan even if you don't know the story there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters with party scenes and a montage of their loot is weak and insulting the story was better off with a more straight forward approach as it is this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers the bigger story in more ways than one is john holmes he is the center of this story anyway this movie should have been all about him his life he was the one in wonderland with the wonders about to fade away br br p s although it isn't official boogie nights is a better version of holmes life it isn't entirely factual but it's far more enjoyable
<START> this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters it's a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the u k if you've never seen tpb make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done there's a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes
<START> while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too Âcartoonish ' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams' music
<START> one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers an observation which mystifies me not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee it had many young actors who were to become major stars e g tobey maguire before spiderman skeet ulrich before jericho jonathan rhys meyers before tudors james caviezel simon baker mark ruffalo jeffrey wright tom wilkinson and jewel all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing br br when the biographies and accomplishments of the director even when he won an academy award and the actors are listed this film is usually omitted from their past performances i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films however it is seldom every seen on cable i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known
<START> this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the premise was o k but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film jason schwartzman was once again immensely irritating even more so than in rushmore the rest of the cast were quite non eventful scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off putting incredibly juvenile tries to be a road trip american pie but fails dismally on all levels a total waste of everyone's time
<START> possible spoilers br br someone once asked dr seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas he turned them down insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous chuck jones tv special from 1966 also in mind perhaps was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's the 5 000 fingers of dr t when the good dr died in 1991 his widow audrey geisel still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights but with the commonplace use of cgi effects becoming a reality mrs geisel had a change of heart universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of jim carrey as the title character supposedly she was satisfied with the final result well mrs geisel that makes one of us br br the film was given a 123 000 000 budget which is more than even heaven's gate cost including the adjustment for inflation which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup set design and special effects which are undermined br br somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography unfortunately it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what jeffrey price and peter s seaman scribes of who framed roger rabbit which made much better br br use of a high budget turned in whereas the tv special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the grinch it turns out that as a child he was the subject of ridicule including an especially humiliating experience one christmas at the age of eight so it turns out that everything that ails our poor mr grinch is directly because of the whos trouble is it seems like a rather long 105 minutes with too much dead wood clogging up the story that might not seem so bad if only the grinch were a little more well grinchy the character that dr seuss wrote and chuck jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change and exponential growth of heart carrey's grinch is a loud hyperactive oaf and at times a thug who when made the holiday cheermeister ' trashes the whoville town square in anger br br hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked this undermines the script's attempt to make the grinch more sympathetic with all the whos down in whoville so unsympathetic at least in this interpretation br br the whoville of dr seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of christmas the whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled selfish materialistic ninnies an obvious attempt to comment on american consumerism this is offensively br br hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from american consumerism and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising br br campaign br br the film also expands and redefines the character of cindy lou who a small but crucial character in the original the innocent two year old waif who walked in on this spurious santa is now older and wiser constantly questioning the false values of the whos and trying to understand the grinch's point of view her one major scene from the original is re enacted making it seem out of character she br br seems to be the only one who would ever know that christmas is more than just gifts and decorations thus making her a completely different and more annoying character br br those who celebrate christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their br br stockings on the morning of december 25 than a copy of this overlong overacted excruciatingly tedious ham handed crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film it proves once and for all that darkness vulgarity br br manipulation and heavy handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm wit sincerity and heart the folks at universal should get down on their collective knees and thank god that this truly bilious 123 million stink bomb grossed 260 million domestically or they'd not be here today furthermore it made mike myers' the cat in the hat possible
<START> if you rent a movie titled exterminators of the year 3000 the odds are good you know what you're getting yourself into i myself was sold by the promising descriptions of nuke mutants motor psychos and of course the exterminators themselves which according to the back of the movie store case are all cavorting around a post apocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sorts of mayhem let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue at least such were my hopes for this film br br now i like the occasional terrible movie and if you're reading the comments on exterminators of the year 3000 you probably do too that being said i rated this film a solid 1 awful not because i completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at movie making i have ever seen the dialogue the acting the cinematography the sound editing the editing in general the plot etc etc etc all are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous title br br so what is really good about this bad movie it does have several of what my circle affectionately terms quality kills a quality kill for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase isn't a hard and fast term but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome creative or ridiculous fashion br br exterminators of the year 3000 also has a fair supply of dialogue so bad it becomes funny provided in great part by crazy bull the aptly titled leader of the hapless motor psycho gang who incidentally also provide most of the quality kills if you're hoping for big things from the nuke mutants think again they play essentially zero part in the movie shucks crazy bull however is all you could ask for in a b movie motor psycho shakespearean paraphrase and oddly pg style insults are all he knows how to say and that's terrific br br despite its quality kills and bad dialogue however if you're looking for a truly entertaining bad movie exterminators of the year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects quality killing and bad dialogue there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car chases and long desert hiking sequences all in all a pretty good awful movie but hey it's no death race 2000
<START> though not a horror film in the traditional sense this creepy little film delivers the goods it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town draining its victims of their blood police inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas in one of his early roles is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok the only one who believes him is ruth bertin faye wray the inspector's girlfriend and lab assistant to dr otto von niemann lionel atwill who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory the townspeople suspect the weirdo herman gleib played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role the film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed one funny part has gussie schnappmann maude eburne ruth bertin's aunt thinking weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog maude eburne and dwight frye make a good comedy team br br this budget movie brings in elements from the cabinet of dr caligari with dr niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders from frankenstein by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory and dracula since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker thses elements are mixed well by director frank r strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure the concoction works the restored version i viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere so try to see the this version if possible
<START> i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting i watched it despite the fact that i don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with this author's work i admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it however i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production the 'explicit' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv several times so it was nothing very shocking i'm afraid full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content i'm afraid
<START> john carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication his excuse is that he only produced it jon bon jovi looks like a girl in fact bon jovi and the two vampire girls natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes in short it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp model sort of way bon jovi has the most charisma at least he looks happy when he is smiling the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss but stop amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires at one point arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening as far as gore is concerned a few heads are ripped off and the blood spurts profusely these scenes have so little suspense or build up that when they happen it is almost funny and there is no horror pay off from the scene all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of wow that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls i wonder who has to clean it up throughout the movie these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover the top vampire in the world keep reaching out to her at one point bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow and has done so on other occasions he says i am not trying to hurt you i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you huh of course the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device why can't we be friends the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie aside from all of the other silly moments there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion i guess blood type is not important anyhow all her vampire blood is removed bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also of course as the vampire blood is transfused into him none of his healthy blood is removed so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body and just like the first vampires this one also has the vampires bursting into flames special effect
