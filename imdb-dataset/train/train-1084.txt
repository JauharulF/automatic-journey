<START> i am at a distinct disadvantage here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on it's own it was pretty boring br br you never get a real good look at the maniac cop's robert z'dar face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the nc 17 director's cut i may be more impressed br br the ending with the car chase with z'dar caitlin dulany and robert davi was pretty intense best part of the movie
<START> with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of 20 dates i won't waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitz's hyper woody allen style narration was extremely annoying you either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it's potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i'll give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of i appreciate the boundaries intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna be filmmaker and therefore i question the film's sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith
<START> i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time
<START> this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation br br excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience
<START> the direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original however as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes br br another note is jay chow himself do not know kung fu it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can many people today can see the differences luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects br br i think that jay's acting is still a pain to watch especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity br br despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this orginal movie getting what it shouldn't have it has became one of the best budget films in china for this year
<START> william lustig's followup to maniac proves conclusively that without tom savini's spectacular effects and spinell's convincing performance maniac would never have become the cult hit that it did vigilante is badly directed with a simple minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn and also mediocre performances by all the actors judging from the sense of deja vu this film gave me lustig had watched death wish several times too many before making this 1 2
<START> my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory however of the 10 pages of reviews only a handful are negative i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future br br i admit i'm more inspired to write reviews when i don't like a movie than as to when i do so my handful of reviews are all negative still that doesn't mean i'm biased towards not enjoying a movie but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy br br paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i've seen in years by using an intelligent concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds it is art for arts sake but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment directors can't write writers can't direct i'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated but that is because he's an actor turn director which rarely works either br br what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don't make any sense are not completed in 5 minutes and in total spoil paris to me why call it paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f ck there are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by alfonso cuarÃ³n but everything else will fall into obscurity the coen brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar it's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it as we all love paris present company included we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks in fact i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes seriously seriously br br people natalie portman is not a good actress she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours and maggie gyllenhaal why are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies i'm looking at you natalie portman garden state closer elijah wood sin city and catalina sandino moreno maria full of grace br br one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable br br writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right i'm thinking of ernst hemingway raymond carver f scott fitzgerald and john cheever just to name a few it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this the same can be said about short films it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history br br if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all the directors either didn't care or were lazy in either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it
<START> when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wide ranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinema br br scorcese's story is primarily about hollywood's directors Â actors producers screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the director's vision and the distributor's profit motive between art and commercial viability he even opens with a clip from vincente minnelli's the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction this dictates the structure for the documentary scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichÃ©s have become challenged how mavericks have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different however scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he lavishes praise on cecil b de mille or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonetheless br br scorcese doesn't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of scorcese's biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of vincente minnelli probably the most often referenced director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america scorcese would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of us born filmmakers that was produced elsewhere Â such as that of stanley kubrick br br rather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with dw griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although scorcese is not keen on them he is even handed enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesn't simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then rewinds back to the 1940s to show how a low budget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elements br br a personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his iconoclasts chapter he looks at lolita and barry lindon for me his two most underrated films scorcese's respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he interrupts them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the 40s and 50s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema and after all i don't think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journey br br one word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
<START> god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i'm a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron
<START> in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass this film was probably quite revealing in its day however i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica's bag since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan he organises the inhabitants into community action and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me as these people have far more important things to think about like where the next pot noodle is going to come from anyway de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are it's all down to capitalism of course and in order to illustrate this he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land brilliant to his credit though by this time he has given up on making a serious film and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures all fur coats and cigars they want that land but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense by a bizarre stroke of luck his old deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove he uses it to shower gifts on his mates who prove just as greedy as the cigar men i reckon this film was a missed opportunity to address the theme of poverty as not many film makers had done until then and then get caught up in a fairy tale to me seems a bit daft how come 'great' directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks de sica however is proclaimed as a genius for this surely the fact that these people are so poor that their faith is unswerving and that miracles never happen to them is enough for any story teller to work on br br
<START> this movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didn't care for his character i don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame what so ever had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boring br br gina gershon's character was unnecessarily british she could've just as easily been an uptight out of towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie br br the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy nominations for bothÂ stat plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama clichÃ© moments what a mess of a movie
<START> i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide i definitely liked it this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen my first impression i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex to be confusing br br the movie is set in the future a man james cole bruce willis is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past 1996 to be specific a virus killed 5 billion people he is sent from the future to get some information about it also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end br br one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post apocalyptic movies the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life you want to see the ocean be with her is especially a poignant line in this movie it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters br br the performances are quite good bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully i have to check out his other movies the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch ever since i saw this movie i have become so obsessed with her she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him br br the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary br br good thriller 10 10
<START> this was not a well done western you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldn't bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film
<START> this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie br br do yourself a favour and don't watch it 1 10
<START> this is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that 'it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end it just cant' you know 'worse than jaws 4' kind of bad br br i honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football br br gore indeed and lots of it well made gore no way br br the acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clichÃ©s same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex blood and violence like so many other gore movies br br if you're hoping for a mix between ichi the killer and august undergroundÂ keep looking you wont find it in live feed
<START> this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de havilland's far more nuanced mature rendering in the heiress 1949 the film's feminist leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel washington square whose author henry james savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels as a fan of old hollywood and great literature i found this movie very disappointing
<START> if you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the disney movie for you my sons loved every minute of this film and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right this should go down as one of the disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non stop excitement
<START> seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable it prompted me to exclaim oh my god more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly br br fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable near impossible human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist br br if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time br br that a film released in 2003 is already being shown on tv in july 2003 might give an indication of the film's quality
<START> i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit man this movie was rife with absurdities of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie the acting was deplorable and the story was even worse as a sane minded and rational individual i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie there was ineptness on the part of every main character there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events then the movie ended one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie it only makes a talkative train wreck
<START> when i first saw the cover of this movie a giant bug chasing a few nurses and the name blue monkey i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese ball flick who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles the fx are pretty corny there isn't too much of a plot and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey but come on people what did you expect it's not really as bad as it seems if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies this one is basically an updated version without the updates special fx
