<START> why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it pittsburgh pa why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there br br when this movie was originally to be released it was more of a romantic comedy and no robo anything that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either sheesh
<START> at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis a couple of times but no worries it's not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let's start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it's not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter's bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep br br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba
<START> well it was funny in spots this film is a 4 or maybe a 3 its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust rent this one after you seen everything else beats boredom but not by that much my wife like like this film better then i do maybe its not that bad
<START> i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made some days i'd see something spectacular and some days i'd be disappointed br br yet being the kind of fan i am i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was sorely disappointed br br while i love the richard donner movies i didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to superman's character and his powers br br singer however chose to take the worst elements of the donner movies and put them in his version br br while his lex luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a shyster a conman and a common criminal he's no more intelligent than when gene hackman played him kevin spacey does his best to play luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog br br his henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen most of them literally have no dialog in the movie br br spoilers ahead kitty kowalski is almost exactly the same character as ms tesmacher she seems to be as evil and cold as lex luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays luthor br br the biggest disappointment in the movie was frank langella as perry white i wasn't a huge fan of the over the top perry white in the donner movies but at least he had a soul he was after all said and done a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story langella's perry white is nothing but a corporate stooge he wants everyone to concentrate on the superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing he doesn't care about the real stories the real mysteries like the black out and what lex luthor is up to now that he's out of prison br br the worst thing about langella is that he's dull some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep frank langella is puddle br br brandon routh is not a bad actor he's ok but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie not the actor's fault his movements are clearly meant to look graceful like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies but it still looks choreographed and artificial br br lois lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by kate bosworth unfortunately again for a pulitzer prize winning journalist and writer she is about as eloquent as any teenage on dawson's creek br br james marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie mostly because he looks more like superman than even routh without any superpowers he manages to figure out lois lane's message flies a plane to the location gets on board luthor's yacht and rescues lois and her son br br the only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking you see them slowly going being immersed in the water you know superman's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them br br as i said before the plot is very haphazard unlike singer has said this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world as soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back even luthor is happy to have superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel br br superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe a big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum lex luthor is out of prison he now has knowledge about superman's powers and weaknesses and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know luthor would be using kryptonite against him br br according to the movie the only thing superman is good for is lifting really really heavy things the action sequences are all incredibly predictable
<START> i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie with all due respect its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills a bigger budget and more gore br br the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film it is not nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one it is a psychological thriller it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie reel com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change very rare these days is something bad and not worth it br br i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing we sympathize with this cold blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing br br i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale aka smart people since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare br br kudos to the acting as well for such a low budget film you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction writing and acting please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb this movie is worth it i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice
<START> whattt was with the sound it sounded like it was all dubbed br br otherwise bad plot bad accents bad even dougray and we live in scotland acting bad harp bad sex scenes bad cringeworthy br br still we watched it until the end in disbelief how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly will they ever get a decent job again br br bad bad bad by the way we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot etc br br and to the older reviewer i totally agree it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s how did it get made in 2004 br br ok ok there were some ok bits they had a nice house in bristol dougray had a nice boat jennifer looked nice in a little outfit but how come the sister got all the men
<START> i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don't watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic br br i didn't like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
<START> i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and to this day still do a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed sure it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone and indiana jones but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar i am surprised not too many people know about it it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86 i watched it back then on cable tv it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks cool flick
<START> nick and kelly are ready to be married but travis kelly's dog leads nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for kelly richard burgi and susan walters play nick and kelly and make a good couple nick loves to drink smoke and play pool with the fellas for fun but nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child we find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from earth to save their population it becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved a fine film
<START> the crater lake monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film i've ever seen ranking right up there with manos the hands of fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and kindergarten level production values in this movie a silly looking claymation stop motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in bumblebum ca and begins dining on the local hayseeds in the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with flippers drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would be lunch before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times it dies from boredom every character in this moovie is a complete moron one pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a 4 75 pint of ripple instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster unfortunate close ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam there's a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent to make him seem more legit two overly bumbling redneck boat renters some cheesy pre historic cave art done in crayon and annoying banjo pickin' background moosic in one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife girlfriend accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still even on constant fast forward this moovie hurts and hurts bad moocow says call the fumigators 'cause this cow pie really stinks 8p
<START> i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isn't one of those it was so bad it was funny this isn't one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasn't even one of those what the heck was that movies i can't recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no definable style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the time br br i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles and or story telling but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties the incubus has none br br i actually contemplated not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie
<START> besides all of the technical mistakes br br how about a female flight attendant who's able to kill all by herself 4 out of the 7 terrorists including ex marines 2 of whom without even using a gun then she lands the plane perfectly we're not talking about sigourney weaver or linda hamilton we're talking about a regular frightened yet very well composed flight attendant d how about the leader in charge of the assault rescue squad having a full proof according to the logic of the script plan of sleep gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists guns blazing not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not securing a position of advantage so that his whole team gets easily wiped out yeah that's using the old noggin only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway and it turns out useless for all intensive purposes br br bad as this movie was though i couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering what next d i can't help but imagine all the excellent unemployed script writers thinking to themselves it's not fair lol d
<START> i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world and black america is ready to see it has comedy drama the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film the characters were well developed and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors such as wood harris remember the titains paid in full brian j white trois 3 mr 3000 and the wonderful zoe saldana drumline pirates of the caribbean the movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace this is not only a story about life in the hospital however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are or who they are going to be
<START> or marlowe at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey quite talky too bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male i e alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo but he is only a fat alpha male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clichÃ©s are all here bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic about to reform as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him it doesn't so he can't be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a well meaning humanitarian i don't think so bacall does her non chalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not all too interesting so called sexual innuendo exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today's standards just purse your lips and whistle a load of crap she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland the cuteness of a myrna loy let alone the likability of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femme fatales in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers but my fast forward button was ready br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by e mail
<START> i saw this movie in 1979 i was 17 or 18 when it was released the theater was perhaps 1 4 full when the movie started ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back we decided to stay for the entire movie why endure such torture here's why we wanted to be true movie critics to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie a 10 they always come up with something better but it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made and this is it a 1 at best there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1 but i have yet to see them i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst i am a true movie critic he he
<START> a difficult film to categorize i was never giving it 110 concentration consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters what their roles were nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted out br br this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which i've better things to do too than be on here br br a high 4 10
<START> slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching dave devon sawa sam jason segel and jeff michael c maronna are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now during final exams these big men on campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura prepon though she's not in the movie very much the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels scary movie 1 2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4 3 10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping
<START> honestly i find this film almost too depressing for my own good it is very depressing until pretty much the very end there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i didn't like well except for the disgusting character played by fredrick forrest but it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing br br a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family they believe they've lost one son but it turns out they've lost 2 the key is if they just communicate and face their grief together they won't end up losing their second son permanently br br but they just can't something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased that andy character truly is a snake the only member of the family that isn't threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa wilford brimley grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold isn't saying much these days it is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock in denial or that his way of grieving may not be the same style or at the same speed as they would expect it's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is made of stone just because they don't grieve in a way we believe they ought br br the story is very quiet and naturalistic you're not going to get some spoon fed narration or some hollywood feel good resolution i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy andy's wife for something he should not blame himself for arnold may have accidentally killed his brother but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage which apparently was a lousy one anyway except for the two people in the marriage it's only dumb luck arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer br br robert duvall and glenn close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son to find out what arnold is going through jason presson whom i've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called explorers and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white did an incredible job as arnold a great performance from a child actor br br aside from being somewhat slow at times the stone boy is an excellent and very depressing movie
<START> we all create our own reality or do we that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m c escher this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of who are we and what is our place in the universe ' and turn it into a captivating and fun filled 100 minutes the film centers on bart a writer struggling with his screenplay the sea that thinks ' as he sits at his computer the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer writing the screenplay before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception ultimately de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses note after you've seen the movie check out the film's entertaining web site dutch with english subtitles eric moore
<START> while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious it's just a movie and it's not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i've shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much it's worth
