<START> some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined i disagree totally the shows quality did not go up or down and scrappy win my opinion as a very good chrecter i looked at a poll on jumpedtheshark com and 72 of people said scrappys second series was scoobys downfall ok so loads said yes but 28 still cant be wrong i do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people dog solving mystery in same formula scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show sure some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures doubled back to the show all the episodes and segments were very funny i was intriguded by the yabba shorts and but at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion there is certainly no fact involved but in my opinion this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and lease of life nuff said
<START> 'mojo' is a story of fifties london a world of budding rock stars violence and forced homosexuality 'mojo' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language it's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems in consequence a very distant country indeed and therefore stresses the particular rather than the universal in the story 'mojo' features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying ones from aiden gillan and ewan bremner the latter still struggling to build a post 'trainspotting' career but feels like a period piece a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom rather dull actually
<START> good grief i can't even begin to describe how poor this film is don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting much to begin with let's face it a pg 13 slasher flick is pre destined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and clichÃ© on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away br br we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here's a turnup for the books she never changes hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again br br on top of this we're handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i'm not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie br br finally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteen year old director what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time br br closets that's what br br lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching
<START> this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop tony costas and pat morita as a tokyo cop sent to detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named derrick jarryd unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype an angry derek jarryd tries to distance himself from phillip madras who led the men but madras played by chris sarandon has none of it and threatens jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership meanwhile in the same junk yard where the japanese man had been killed a friend of tony costas was also killed by the same men tony's friend had been watching the junk yard br br tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case while tony is investigating the crime he runs into the japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him eventually they end up working together on the case they make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as pat morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking madras in the head but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie at least in my opinion jay leno is no actor but he is likable in the role and pat morita is good as well still they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film if you liked buddy cop films cheesy 80's movies or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommend this movie
<START> well i'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the 'giallo' but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation in the sixties and seventies italian film makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released they've not done that here but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film 'the postman always rings twice' without giving the book's author james m cain so much as a credit anyway the plot focuses on gino costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a cafÃ© where a woman named giovanna bragana works he soon learns that she's married to giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom giovanna can't stand to have even touching her he wants the pair of them to run away together but she's not so keen on the idea however fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful br br despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics the story is as you would expect extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film but it's not a 'great' film the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads there's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m cain classic
<START> because it is that's why this is the same jealous daughter kills people flick we've seen a billion times rosanna arquette makes anything worth watching and mandy schaffer's brief nude scene after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile but not quite br br out of
<START> pre adolescent humor is present in large quantities the acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the worms are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience br br tom cavanagh and hallie kate eisenberg stole the spotlight but the young ty panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few years br br miss eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery br br the story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying friendship and fairness it creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some gross scene from the film
<START> don't really know where to start with one of the worst films i have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time from the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited london for even 1 day will agree was not london to the much unexplained way how snipe's character managed to escape the country back to the us without a single problem then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in america how on earth did grandma agree to that he's an assassin well that's the ending how about during the film well unfortunately that didn't fare much better we have british cops driving an amazing range of cars i'm sure it was an eighties vauxhall belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation but a modern subaru imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior so19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after snipe's along with the cia there were children walking around but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him does this happen in london no it doesn't i live there we also have the very implausible travel from central london to the airport let's say heathrow for arguments sake within 5 minutes of receiving a call we also have terrible american accents a young girl who's posher than the queen but lives in elephant castle what does it say for british police when helicopters and a number of officers at snipe's location can't find snipe's and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs the train station was obviously not even on uk soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible the plot was also extremely poor boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before but there were a few notable actors cast in this film what were they thinking and please don't let that sway you to watch this film this film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it if you want an all out action film which this is not then continuity and scenery can be put to the side
<START> unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton sleepwalks through his role and sophia loren's closed in this movie face doesn't display much passion either
<START> just kidding about the weight loss thing well you might lose weight you never know anyway what can i say i love this film it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic mystery and horror they perceive jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with watch it with friends watch it with loved ones build a fort wine optional
<START> this film was made in saskatchewan and manitoba parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the wild western canada is left when archie began to write his stories for the papers the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert absorb the first nation peoples br br the film puts forward and asks the question why would a well educated obviously talented englishman become an indian br br archie as an english boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless no mater what it is sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it br br in my opinion i saw archie become my living image of the cigar store indian a very wooden character and not real at all very well done acting on the part of mr brosnan he also portrayed the wild indian in the dance scene for the tourist the fullness and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife annie br br annie pushed archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the englishman's world stage not as himself but grey owl an canadian native of the wilderness frontier br br this is the closest archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype br br mr brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done i have watched documentaries on grey owl and i think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection br br spoiler i thought the final scenes with archie going to meet the grand council of chiefs was a great a great moment in the film br br very beautiful canadian lake scenery and real grey owl locations br br
<START> where to start this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on and what was i supposed to hear exactly probably one of the worst scripts ever made i can't believe people actually put up some green for this film it makes me think i could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them finance a movie for me br br dolph was a usual dolph nothing else needs to be said the villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker if you really want to know what not to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this
<START> even if one didn't realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmer's famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the anti oriental overtones of rohmer's concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well br br and then there's peter sellers he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary grimness thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities sellers' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny br br a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk cato in the pink panther films as one of manchu's minions and helen mirren's amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they won't learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu
<START> i've seen the original non dubbed german version and i was surprised how bad this movie actually is thinking i had seen my share of bad movies like ghoulies 2 rabid grannies zombie lake and such nothing could've prepared me for this it really was a pain to sit through this flick as there's no plot no good acting and even the special effects aren't convincing especially the so called zombies wearing nothing more than white make up and their old clothes so their good set wouldn't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains br br if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life then watch it for all the others don't do it because you will regret it
<START> tierney's an authentic tough guy but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner just count the times tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts the old clichÃ© about it only happening in the movies applies here in spades then there's the guy playing the watchman who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy ruining the menacing mood in the process the static one room sets don't help either and neither does director feist's obvious lack of feel for the material then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off and the results are pretty flat in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station attendants too bad that tieney's career never really gelled i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy best anyway this project might have worked as a radio play but as a movie with a promising noir title it's a disappointment
<START> this is about the worst movie i have ever seen this movie does match the quality of such movies as they cabin fever but even those had name actors where this one fell short the eye candy of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift just an example of the quality i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible ladies i have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at but not much either if you were planning on going to see this movie i would strongly recommend saving your money
<START> fragile carne just before his great period although it is sometimes hesitantly directed and marred by longueurs hotel du nord is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french films of the late 1930s as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director all of his great virtues are here the cramped interiors broken up by gliding complex delicious camera movements a melancholy deployment of light and shade remarkable wistful sets by alexander trauner which are so evocative that they as the title suggests take on a shaping personality of their own the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert a seemingly casual plot about romance tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time in this case louis jouvet and arletty br br in fact the film's biggest failing and i find myself astonished as someone who usually didactically minimises its importance to admit it is its script it has plenty of wit and poignancy but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacques prevert brought to their best films it cannot avoid slipping into cliche even if it is only cliche in hindsight br br ostensibly set in the boarding house the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love and emotional metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well annabella is very beautiful but not very good at doing tragic while aumont's callowness brilliantly appropriate though it may be by its nature obtrudes any real felt romance maybe it's just me but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple so young so attractive who after only a few months are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other their high flown lines are rather embarrassing too of course this affair is not meant to be plausible they are symbolic of youth hope and possibility being crushed in france or maybe france itself despairing resigned waiting for death for symbols to be truly powerful they must convince on a narrative level which i feel they don't quite here br br what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m edmond a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters although we only learn it gradually he is a killer in hiding living off the prostitute played by arletty having dobbed in his accomplices in his previous 'role' and the theatricality of his position is crucial he had one set of traits in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite living a rather aimless life he is profoundly shaken by the lovers' pact and becomes fatalistic realising the folly of trying to cheat death br br in this way the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to edmond is like a romantic prototype of melville's clinical killers with one exception he gives briefly into hope a delusion which only strenghtens if that's not too much of an unbearable irony his fatal resolve br br all this could have been trite if it wasn't for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet i had studied his theatrical work at college but this was my first taste of his screen talents and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats grant mastroianni clift mason mitchum cotten giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception he needless to say is allegorical too than an actual person edmond begins the film a minor supporting character but emerges as a tragic hero of some force like all those major actors jouvet's brilliance lies in what he conceals br br on a formal level what amazes is carne's grasping ten years before its flourishing of the techniques of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk ophuls ray and minnelli although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear eyed beauty of sierck's contemporary german melodramas check out the masterpieces zu neuen ufern and la habenera carne's style truly fits his theme that of entrapment paralysis resignation br br the film's principle motif is that of water the credits float and dissolve the hotel stands by a waterway but instead of renoir's open river of possibility we have a canal stagnant and manmade going nowhere the film begins as it ends and the setting never changes except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return characters can only escape through death their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy the walls and frames that hold them captive the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve any hope at the end therefore is profoundly if romantically compromised
<START> is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface so in that respect imdb's average voting score is spot on br br a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of falcon crest dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially br br the slugs involved are originals from asturias northern spain but as they were not allowed into the united states plastic ones had to be made however chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it the actors involved were also a rather tatty array just suitable for a low budget film which might be categorised as horrific horrifying horrible or just simple awful br br as a result the outcome is negligible on the surface undetected underground and about as attractive as chapter 17 000 of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad
<START> my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore i think the title especially put me off i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly i could have kept watching for hours another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since she is so perfect in this movie this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time
<START> though not seen in too many films prior you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since br br not one of grant's nor loy's best films they make an outstanding effort together after all with that much talent and very good supporting cast you know the laughs will be there br br the film is light has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through br br a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time br br definite saturday afternoon fare heavy on the popcorn
