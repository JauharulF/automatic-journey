<START> i am a huge michael madsen fan so needless to say i bought this movie without even renting it or anything this movie was so horrible i didn't even take it back to the store i wouldn't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison i just threw it in the trash never mind the money it was worth the price to be able to throw it away the acting wasn't that bad it wasn't good or anything the story was horrible and the ending was something i despise he was a broken man alcoholic his life was a bunch of junk i thought his horse peanuts was an awful device to show his childhood innocence a dog would have been much much better i also hate religion so this ending without a doubt angered me jesus heals all i hate that i know people just like this that are huge christians and catholics and time will show that god doesn't heal all or anything it was a horrible movie if u have the option to see it pass or better yet buy it or rent it and throw it in the garbage and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
<START> i watched it with my mom and we were like br br what the hell we didn't get it at all i may have this wrong but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie shakes cane at movie i'm never seeing it again and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies too they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books it's driving me crazy br br and whit was butt ugly and yet she loves him more than hugh who was a tiny bit nicer looking br br my rating 1 10
<START> who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community certainly not the makers of fido who take us to a never never land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class timmy robinson is the all american boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full time domestic a recently resurrected zombie whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido all of this has been made possible by zomcom a big brother type organization that has found a way to render the zombies who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space manageable and docile at least most of the time br br this twisted modern day spin on the tv series lassie it might easily have been entitled a boy and his zombie takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre '60s concerns as obsessive social conformity here keeping up with the joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door the sterility of suburban life the corporate control of civic affairs small town corruption and nuclear family values all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns the movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs instead this is a low keyed subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full bellied guffaws much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine despite some playfully graphic violence the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy low budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade br br k'sun ray carrie ann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wide eyed timmy and his cleaver esquire parents with slightly sinister undertones while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse br br this is what lassie might have been had timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies
<START> we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible
<START> this is a reunion a team and a great episode of justice from hesitation to resolution clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a superman who like green arrow sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ready to save the whole planet this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork loyalty and friendship this is also about deciding what's more important in life a lesson for clark i do not want the series to end but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any rewind pushes and put a good end here of smallville and a wonderful beginning of superman br br in this episode however we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team nine stars should give it enough credit
<START> one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story one loved it or hated it but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10 for me this movie rated a 4 there are some beautiful scenes and locations and ray milland turns in a fabulous job as oliver's father but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings at least not for me i may be a bit of a snob but i tend to avoid movies with ryan o'neal i still haven't seen barry lyndon because most of them but not all are ruined for me by his presence the lone exception is what's up doc in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for barbra streisand's goofball protagonist and not coincidentally he takes a shot at love story for good measure mcgraw and o'neal tend to mug their lines rather than act them br br this movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career it was tommy lee jones's first movie
<START> when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment imho thus for instance dogville even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention or other pet causes of kidman's br br here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job i don't how or who was able to restrain her but apparently it worked the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman and consequently what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable br br of course the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable it isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances br br also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture and while they are his adversaries they are never really his enemy in effect they teach him to be compete br br i really marveled at kidman's ability to physically appear russian it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing br br i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film despite my gratuitous digs at ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime
<START> being an otaku since the days of robotech i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality although the final episode is in black and white it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to macho man tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers the seiryuu for noriko incidentally also plays akane in ranma 1 2 noriko is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious homing laser and buster shield which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style technique i doubt that scene was meant to be funny but it cracked me up yet all in all i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time
<START> i had been looking forward to how to lose friends alienate people for months particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine how to lose friends alienate people hit the spot of course not perfect but very enjoyable and funny how to lose friends alienate people follows the life of sidney young a smalltime bumbling british celebrity journalist who is hired by an upscale magazine in new york city in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses peers and superstars after disrupting one black tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant sidney catches the attention of clayton harding editor of sharp and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city clayton warns sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can if he wants to succeed instead sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer alison olsen kirsten dunst he dares to target the star clients of power publicist eleanor johnson gillian anderson he also upsets his direct boss lawrence maddox danny huston sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone his saving grace a rising starlet sophie maes megan fox who develops an odd affection for him in time allison's friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his downward spiraling career the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given simon pegg is still hilarious as ever he makes sydney bumbling obnoxious and annoying as real as it gets but later in time making sydney not just likable but also a real character who you root for in the end kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes and jeff bridges is just jeff f cking bridges how can you not like him he makes clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy gillian anderson megan fox and danny huston were great as the supporting cast each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable but that's what just made the film work one thing i didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were i understand that most were the supporting cast but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it how to lose friends alienate people will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever or even top 10 comedies ever but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well how to lose friends alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year 8 10
<START> even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn't join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
<START> super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd bigscreen 5 1 channel sound system the imax camera puts you right in the race car where you cruise around various tracks at high speed reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix if only that would appear on dvd i enjoy watching it again and again br br the only minus and why i didn't give it a 10 is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief all you can hear in a real car is the engine you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges
<START> i read somewhere in a fairly panning review that this is something of a live action mecha anime and i think they're on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back i don't think this is to be taken too seriously it's just a bit of good old 80's almost a tv movie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isn't stressed too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic no clichÃ©s no predictable lines all in all just good fun maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me it's by no means perfect but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that let the nerds and comic store guys worry about technicalities who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision no one else's opinion matters
<START> i have been a fan of this movie for years and years because of teri hatchers move into the forefront i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous although i never have watching daytime soap operas this movie kills me every time i watch it the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already you will get to see elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher and carrie fisher to name a few all give splendid performances
<START> first of all this movie is 34 minutes long which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies second of all you need to do this this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky and pigs eating their own fried flesh that's only the beginning the scenes and images extraordinary on their own flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re watching furthermore the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary which given the extremely spare dialog only enhances the viewing the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup along the lines of well the artists were asking what we should do in this scene but i didn't know myself so its hard to say why it turned out as it did that's a bad paraphrase by the way also the sound throughout the film is very high quality very precise and very moody in all the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows br br first viewing watch the dvd without the commentary second viewing watch the dvd with the commentary third viewing rewatch without the commentary br br once you've watched it three times however you're not going to stop there
<START> eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle if you are not the sort of person who can't stand swearing then i wouldn't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5 10 seconds i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best
<START> the dazzling seventeen minute dance sequence of george gershwin's 1928 orchestral piece an american in paris is an indisputable masterwork choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly the vibrant combination of color music and dance is still eye poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece manet in the flower market utrillo in a paris street rousseau at the fair vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de l'opera piece and toulouse lautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit the 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting not by a long shot but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 oscar winning musical br br director vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan a former g i who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry the love triangle plot is focused on jerry's involvement with milo roberts a self proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub jerry unapologetically falls for lise a young woman who turns out to be the fiancÃ©e of henri a professional entertainer and friend of jerry's pal adam an out of work concert pianist romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed br br the best of these is the most imitated a swooningly romantic song and dance to our love is here to stay along a faux seine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love i got rhythm and s'wonderful spotlight kelly's nimble tap dancing and agreeable singing while embraceable you is danced impressively by caron in a five scene montage of henri's all over the map description of lise to adam designed to show off caron's dancing versatility the sequence is similar to the one in on the town where vera ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly's sailor character described his multi faceted vision of miss turnstiles br br as lise the nineteen year old caron in her first film dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years looking quite glamorous nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam performing an elegant i'll build a stairway to paradise george guÃ©tary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end this is not the best all around mgm musical but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile the 2000 dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras
<START> i would say for it's time this movie was awesome and yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually judge this movie you should see it there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken don't use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself god will bless you if that is why you are watching them
<START> who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie br br accidental killing of a security guard characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them and better br br a red toolbox of death please br br hypothermic weak thugs br br acting from hell br br stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy thriller voyeurism and female uhm rambo br br unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person do not watch walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine br br and on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence br br mrs montford shoot 'em up was fun and funny this is just pathetic and terrible good luck next time
<START> father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air think in the simple life i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters all the animals are very likable and funny and even sigfried and roy had their moments the music was good i liked many of the songs br br even if the show isn't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved what a shame
<START> sidney young pegg moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine sharpe's in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression br br based on toby young's book about survival in american business this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isn't br br this 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story we start off in the past then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how young made his mark at one of america's top magazines br br pegg hot fuzz is too likable for words whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for his antics with babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing but he pulls it off splendidly br br bridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest megan fox who stole transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star the fact that her character sophie myles is starring in a picture about mother teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool to emphasize the point there is a dog and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy with a great little twist br br though a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the american professionalism the inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star's gives this edge br br weide's first picture is not perfect there are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary the physical comedy can also be overdone as a side note the bloopers on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour long br br this comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching
