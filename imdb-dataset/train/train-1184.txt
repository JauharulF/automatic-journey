<START> a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle br br i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs unique camera angles i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars cheesy clarinet stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history but unfortunately these so bad they are good moments can't overcome the too bad they stink stretches br br jan in the pan annoyed me with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper the somewhat less than evil laughter and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and 2 dd batteries br br i couldn't even entertain myself with dr bill's horrid overacting and moral self righteousness usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion in this case i was bored with it br br the best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960's version of body shopping and i even found myself nodding off during that br br don't spend money on this one there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
<START> there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performances br br the story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars' table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br show people 11 11 28 king vidor marion davies william haines dell henderson
<START> it's really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow mounties and hockey players this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red violin far better than all but the best hollywood efforts br br gustad noble is anything but that he is a middle aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a fascinating and i would assume accurate portrayal of middle class urban life in india at the time br br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read rohinton mistry's book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the complexities of the book but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film read and see such a long journey
<START> i really wanted to like this movie it has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories bloodthirsty zombies a perfectly hideous 80s touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy it reminds me of some beloved italian horror flicks but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there it just goes on and on and on and then it logically has to end more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed
<START> joe don baker he was great in walking tall and had a good bit part in goldeneye but here in final justice all hope is gone the dark side has won br br as with most of humanity my main experience with this one was on mst3k and what an experience it was mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely it's obvious they were just beginning with mitchell on their anti joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme br br it makes for a funny experience though there are plenty of choice riffs my favorites john rhys davies for sale it's 'meatloaf texas ranger' none of them are sponge worthy why was she wearing her prom dress to bed and my favorite 'son of a ' what what was he the son of son of a preacher man br br by itself final justice is as joe don puts it in the movie a big fat nada but here it actually has some entertainment value you get a chance catch this version of final justice br br two stars for final justice ten for the mst3k version only br br oh and try not to visit malta when joe don's in town
<START> i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam jan '06 and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards many people reacted shocked and protesting he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is cruel like this and it's not funny people don't like it that itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble' nevertheless i think this a bad movie film technically it's a good one nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors the director pretends to make a psychological movie the psychology however is of poor quality describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty the director pretends to describe that but is not good in that br br the director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people mentioning for instance the teacher only this teacher wasn't selfish just someone in several roles caring for his pupils Ã¡nd worried about his script i think it's a simplification to call him selfish the atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes 'you terribly let me downÂ' but it doesn't become believable for me that there is caused sÃºch a lot of pain that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things in fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes Â and it needs far better descriptions the interesting thing would be how does it work describe that process for me please so that we understand br br with the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life it was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists promoting black white thinking the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right there are enough black white thinkers in the world causing lots of war and misery i hope this movie won't be successful
<START> i absolutely loved this soap it has been one of my favorite will highly recommend i just love brazilian soaps they deal with real life events i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere for those of you who have not seen it please see it i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love i can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it xica has been by far the best soap i have ever seen forget everything else go xica hope you all like it as well
<START> why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling br br you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows br br the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it's very believable and it doesn't stop there they have a final shock for you br br it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman's kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort
<START> carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car brian chris pine of star trek is driving and his girlfriend bobby piper perabo of coyote ugly has shotgun while brian's younger brother danny lou taylor pucci of fanboys and his friend not exactly girlfriend kate emily vancamp of the ring 2 occupy the backseat this quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare apparently a viral pandemic which co directors co scenarists alex pastor and david pastor tell us absolutely nothing about has devastated america naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies br br this lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band initially this foursome encounters a desperate father frank christopher meloni of runaway bride and his cute little daughter jodie kiernan shipka of land of the lost blocking the highway with their suv brian swerves around frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot reluctantly they hitch a ride with frank after they seal jodie up in the rear of the suv she wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it sadly somebody has lied to frank the hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some kool aid that will put them out of their misery the cure did not improve their condition everybody else in town is dead kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his suv and take off br br indeed carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves they reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump action shotguns incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse eventually they discover that one of them has become infected later as they are about to run out of gas brian blocks the highway like frank did at the outset danny tries to stop a pair of older christian women driving the car danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her br br no carriers is not a beer pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non existent by the end of this 84 minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight chris pine makes quite an impression as fun loving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well known actress piper perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role as bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price it is a testament to pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others essentially pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one eighty from happy go lucky guy to heartless guy br br the two directors are spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag since there is no relief in sight carriers sinks into predictability irrÃ©versible cinematographer benoÃ®t debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes debie makes it look like a dynamic film aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical the scene when the german shepherd attacks danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved unfortunately the pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense by fade out you really don't care what happens to anybody
<START> i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in ohio and yesterday i was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god awful film in class we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete disaster br br the problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren't good at memorizing lines so producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors sounds like a great idea right well the kind of acting one does on stage doesn't show up too well on film most of the actors in atlantic look and sound like they're acting in a play which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over acting another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones you couldn't move the mikes like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through there was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie in one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away it goes on like this for a couple more people the microphone is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor carousel br br those are only technical problems if you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse the story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the titanic the characters are unbelievable and pointless a story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie it is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place a lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times it is tiresome and you can't wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with i'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals they both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats they were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didn't so they were shot i was appalled br br i give this movie a 2 10 i would have given it a 1 10 the lowest rating possible but i gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and i tried to put it into context if you want to see a good early sound film check out alfred hitchcock's blackmail that also came out in the year 1929 you will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately
<START> i lost my father at a very young age so young in fact that i have no recollection of him over the years i have learned many things about him one of those things was that he loved westerns and watching bonanza every sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him i myself remember the tail end of the series' run having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973 watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father it has all the right elements to make a show successful laughter tears edge of your seat suspense and it even angered you at times my most vivid memory of the show's original run came shortly after the death of our beloved hoss cartwright dan blocker one particular episode and the end of the closing credits flashed a picture of blocker and faded to black and i can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of this i can remember this as though it were yesterday on behalf of my late father who is not here to say so himself we love bonanza long live the cartwrights
<START> without a doubt 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place br br bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen he is actually sane but the people of the future or present if you will distort this guy's head so bad through time travel no wonder he unravels he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance we get to see willis madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross referenced over the course of 6 years br br stowe is sensual and solid as the risk taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of seeing each other before in another place or time 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world br br the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is against all usual hollywood stereotype not to save the world he is gathering information the film plays tricks on the viewer as well placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard boiled movie making he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits and brazil the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big budget films if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy see 12 monkeys br br rating 9 of 10
<START> i was not expecting much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug centred trip to wales the humour was gentle and subtle as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen cleverly and carefully scripted with great attention to detail i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture i felt i was there with them very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs a delight on all fronts and difficult to criticise though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left wales but overall an unexpected treasure of a film
<START> holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film ug robert duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
<START> there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tasteless like the scene in the laundry room taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia contests because so few people saw it
<START> i don't know what it is about donald sutherland's acting style or vocal style but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex he's just i don't know thick somnambulistic on meds weird br br that said i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release and frankly i don't remember it ending anything like that a bad ending too because nothing gets tied off what about the dead husband the annoying child and was the kid dubbed the scotland yard and military pursuers i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all not just the big panoramic pull away br br and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband even if she was trying to allay needle's suspicions to protect her kid she could always have had a headache that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable
<START> this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and boring at one point there is a one minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run
<START> it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays it's like all you need is a camera a group of people to be your cast and crew a script and a little money and walla you have a movie problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds the video store shelves are filled with these so called films these aren't even guilty pleasures they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema but most of their films are b movie gold however some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some like 'nightmare weekend ' didn't deserve any form of release at all br br pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material some unintentional hilarity moves at a good pace should at 81 minutes br br cons awful writing which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes poorly lit especially the night scenes and the ending which you can't make out at all doesn't make a lick of sense badly scored cheap and very dated effects total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody this is supposed to be a horror film but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary nothing interesting or exciting happens loaded with unnecessary padding br br final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem but i never imagined it would be this bad i don't know if it's the worst film ever made but it's a definite contender troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you br br my rating 1 5
<START> i usually don't comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i have to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f 117 and other hi tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fiction br br it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br simply don't bother br br and one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site 3 7 points and i give this movie a try now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points
<START> okay but just plain dumb not bad for a horror comedy film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe never seen it the horror possibly comedy uncle sam i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21 the day before thanksgiving worth the four bucks l o l at this film br br 9 10
