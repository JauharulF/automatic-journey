<START> this is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film nicole kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out shadowed by nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well the final is moving and logical movie logics of course worth watching if you accept the rules of the game
<START> this film is a true and historical film it is very useful to those researching the lds church because it is 100 true it is an excellent film and i recommend it br br it is very factual exciting and motivational there are some who think it is not factual but it is br br it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and about the prophet joseph smith who restored it it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his courting emma smith emma his wife giving birth and so on but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church
<START> here be spoilers br br recap mia helin is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rÃ¤ttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday she is by far the youngest child and has two sisters eivor ernst and gunilla petrÃ©n eivor has a family and still lives in rÃ¤ttvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away mia is still single and is focused on her career there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle as the party goes on and alcohol consumed more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise br br comments to be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy dramas has been following for years there are really no new elements or ideas this movie draws upon three basic areas 1 embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves 2 sorrow and 3 anxiety this move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along no loss though since the humor that is there is not funny the performances from the cast are good i guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none to conclude there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this br br 3 10
<START> this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad nobody'll admit it it's a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what i'm writing right now i actually plagiarized their faces br br obviously lois is only aroused by power she won't even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn't stop jet liners it can't be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasn't priority number 1 obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kent br br and now it's official kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg person br br superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way he's human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems he's just doing a job when he's saving people br br there's something about clark that lois likes she's really internally in love with him but can't admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a kink in the on the rocks love without superman she would've fallen in love with clark at least that's what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois literally br br superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i would've hated it then too i think br br there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie it's sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex luther's got something fantastic up his sleeve br br superman three now there's a three way love story between superman and lana and clark only humanity wins and clark's inner nature beats superman's power because when his supermoral nature is gone and he's superhuman who does human things with his superpowers she sees it's not the power of superman that she's in love with it's not superpowerman but supermortalman that she loves and who's really super and when she tells clark she prefers him to superman he is elated he has made a human connection again he wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel this is the kind of stuff that's missing from superman returns br br clark super sneezes to help the kid get a strike humanity again plus it's an ineresting use of superpowers he's not just using straight brute strength br br he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving br br it seems there's nothing at stake in superman returns even in superman three we see the damages caused by the nemesis' world domination plot we see suffering we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it there's no damage esp emotional from lex's plot to sink the us we see a glob of crystal thrown into space superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him he couldn't just access his superpowers in the first one he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois' life this was thirty years ago in the second one he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than but combined with lex's genius and the villains' immoral tactics superman's overpowering wasn't enough he had to work one against the other and outsmart them in superman iii again his superpowers weren't enough to win he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw he couldn't use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression and he found that acid earlier when he couldn't simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superbrains he couldn't carry water so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire now in superman returns he simply lunges the island into outerspace like a night temp for ups he doesn't need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength and lex luther's brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk br br to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn't grey poupon he was looking at
<START> the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful specificity italians in brooklyn that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers i e mobsters never appear in acomplication it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs i miss these scenes it also beautifully involves older characters the movie takes it's own slight quiet path to a conclusion there isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax cage and cher do very nice work br br moonstruck invokes old school ethnic workaday new york much like 'marty' except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious
<START> just after i saw the movie the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the 'real' magic in a movie br br the combination of the right music speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body very special things i saw where the not knowing effects in the movie started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an old story telling fairytale with your grandparents br br the magic has returned in me i rate this movie 8 out of 10
<START> everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts oh i laughed a coupe of times but i laughed a couple of times during schindler's list also they really screwed up a good premise
<START> a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea an independent film sounds even better the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity br br but then why is this movie so bland ask the dust br br this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters no one is given a proper back story so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do br br explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this movie br br i told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was awful br br her question not even colin farrell could save it my response not even colin farrell's ass could save it
<START> things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee br br bleek gilliam denzell washington is a happenin' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog his problems include an incompetent manager a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he's playing musical mattress with the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music the band's manager giant has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man br br as bleek denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm he's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness he simply lacks the fire wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee's torpid dialogue as giant lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek's joe buck he adopts a limp and even the i'm walkin' here moment from midnight cowboy in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it br br lee's script is all tepid argument heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles completing this travesty is lee's pretentious visual style tracking shots zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes they just wander br br blues is lee's love letter to jazz made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets and it's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve jazz on film is better served by tavernier's round midnight and eastwood's bird which get below the surface reveal more sides of the form the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon this spike lee joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz it's some pretty bad homegrown
<START> take one look at the cover of this movie and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film this is cheese filmmaking in every respect but it does have its moments despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives the story is actually interesting at some points although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality free boyfriends the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention br br in the nutty professor a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer whereas in the invisible maniac a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible allowing him to spy on and kill for some reason his students boring fodder don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick
<START> this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br i have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story br br maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt br br if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert br br the action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie
<START> once you can get past the film's title pecker is a great film perhaps one of john waters' best a wonderful cast headed by strong performances by edward furlong and christina ricci make the story very funny and very real there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children but they are there for a purpose unfortunately this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it if the opportunity knocks then go see this film
<START> please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek brand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept satire br br this isn't even watered down 'ferris bueller' i'd rather watch a traffic light change br br only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend it's a surreal moment priceless even br br but for the rest of it i'd rather have a toothache at least i can apply some benzocaine tm to stop the pain
<START> after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with seedy characters dirt roads and of course sweaty characters it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men glisten and the ladies um glisten too why because it's hooooottttttttttt and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do sweaty women leave me clammy br br anyway there might be some spoilers in here br br this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be steady pacing though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow' clearly and broadly drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about moods and attitudes that's why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting look at bogart mitchum hurt and nicholson they and their characters were anything but real but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours br br after dark my sweet let's you do that and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and collie are intriguing never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick and patric and dern i love bruce dern by the way are pitch perfect dern especially see previous comment they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies br br the story itself is also interesting there're better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here mostly it's suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with jim thompson's writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you'll see right away from the title what it's all about when it comes to thompson it's not what it's about it's how it's about it to quote roger ebert so really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you don't like it well the jokes on you br br why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead she's not bad per se but she's not angelica huston or anette benning see the adaptation of jim thompson's the grifters if you don't know what i'm talking about besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir it's the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown she simply doesn't have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and patric have some chemistry i don't have it with her so there
<START> i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laserdiscs from ebay usually i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies br br if you are bored by today's special fx films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency there is nothing fake or pretentious about them take mr matuschek for example when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of stewart ok weired example br br yes the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable yet still i liked it a lot if you likes notting hill then you will like shop around the corner in fact hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart
<START> this movie is so bad it's good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn't stop watching it i was laughing so much it's like a parody of a romantic thriller except it's not a parody br br alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he's no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they're in a really awful film they're playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then luke's final words to emily i was howling with laughter br br evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso that's probably the highlight of the film
<START> in 1987 john hughes wrote and directed 'planes trains and automobiles' which was a hilarious and poignant comedy Â the best thing he's ever done ten years on he's reduced to again recycling the plot of 'home alone' in this second sequel which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic the four crooks Â that's right four and one of them is a girl congratulations hughes for introducing this revolutionary change to the series Â are electrocuted with metal chairs brained with barbells and blinded with paint ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha while the new kid is even less charming than culkin you'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'home alone 4'
<START> sleeping with the enemy is a predictable 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try i can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago br br the complete lack of originality from the ronald bass screenplay based upon the nancy price novel does not help nor does the stale direction of joseph ruben or the very average performance from julia roberts the supporting cast including patrick bergin and kevin anderson do little to help br br there really isn't a lot to say just give it a miss br br sunday april 14 1991 hoyts cinema centre melbourne
<START> it's funny i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are repellent and self indulgent messes like this film for me it ranges from great to crap without much in the middle i know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype from my point of view and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too self indulgent his gay or gender bending films like this one tend to be really bad sloppily done sometimes quite boring such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant and sometimes just gross like this film couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic then maybe i'd care about the films br br i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films the bad seems to be out weighing the good
<START> the first collaboration between schoedsack cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the bakhtiari tribe of persia twice a year more than 50 000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture you'll feel like a pampered weakling after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain paths
