<START> aim for the top gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it i totally loved this series and to this day it remains my favorite anime and while it was not gainax's first animated product it was their first ova series br br mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970's sports drama aim for the ace ace o nerae gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with it is because of her father's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters her friend kazumi amano even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot however noriko's coach koichiro ota has faith in her and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko's father was killed br br other characters include jung freud a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to smith toren a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together and kimiko higuchi noriko's childhood friend kimiko's involvement is also of interest as while noriko is off in space kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life and because of the acts of time dilation kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school by the end of the series noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid fifties br br all in all this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation if you like hideaki anno's other shows or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto's artwork then give this show a chance it will grow on you
<START> in new york the family man dentist alan johnson don cheadle meets his former roommate and friend charlie fineman adam sandler by chance on the street charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic september 11th while alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife alan reties his friendship with charlie and they become close to each other alan tries to fix charlie's life sending him to the psychologist angela oakhurst liv tyler but charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court br br reign over me is a good drama about loss friendship family and loneliness the september 11th is irrelevant to the plot it could be a car accident a fire or any other tragedy as well as the sexual harassment of donna remar played by the gorgeous saffron burrows to alan but the family drama works supported by the great performances of adam sandler and don cheadle liv tyler is quite impossible to be recognized i do not know whether she is using excessive make up to look older but her face is weird my vote is seven br br title brazil reine sobre mim reign over me
<START> i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen br br first of all the pace is incredibly slow so it seems much longer than it is and it's not short i'm sure when jane austen wrote the book she made it several pages long filled it with description and didn't intend for people to read in in one day or it might drag and lose it's appeal which emma most certainly did now sense and sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace but at least it had lively lines to make up for it as well as some good performances br br that brings me to flaw 2 which is of course the acting while i don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film i am sure they are capable of good work but i didn't see much of it in this movie it was like people were trying too hard to be witty too hard to be upper class too hard to be british well some of them so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people br br 3 the cast as i said seemed only like actors and not actually like the people they were playing maybe that's a good thing because the people they played really weren't all that nice why did everybody like emma for example sure she was nice to the rich handsome people in front of them but she was an awful gossip behind their backs if her friends were ugly then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs so why is this girl so great why do people have to tell stories just to make her laugh of course the snob couldn't even do that right i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow and her emma did not exactly change my opinion br br well it's easy to see that i did not care for this one i'm sure it's a lovely book and all but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen and emma is one of them
<START> i consider this film to be the best one about mike hammer with biff elliott's performance the definitive mike hammer harry essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements on mickey spillane's novel his direction is strong and imaginative and he makes fine use of light and shadow the camera work by john alton is top notch as is the score by franz waxman the cast includes many veteran players as well as peggie castle in her memorable performance as charlotte manning all in all this is one of the finest private eye films ever made biff elliott and haary essex should have received more opportunities i have always treasured this film
<START> yes a true classic this is what british drama is all about realism and the minimal use of special effects and over inflated budgets i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in 1994 it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot no big names but non the less great acting sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon i myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhs so now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama you should try and enjoy it too br br mark r horobin
<START> it isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like but this time i think i've found it it reminded me of two movies trainspotting small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland and the blair witch project because of the style of filming br br it's about the loyalty between two friends one of them is coming out of jail the other one hasn't been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol as they try to find some fuel they find a farm in the middle of nowhere the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them than it all goes wrong one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland the two friends literally have to run for their lives br br apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time ok that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place the scottish countryside but i still find that quite amazing especially because this isn't actually a bad movie it's perhaps not the greatest movie ever but they still can be proud of what they achieved i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie i give it a 7 10
<START> no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed i wish i could get my time back nice skull face broad really smiles bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script i was spoiler happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption overall i found most of it pointless though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity happy to witness the demise of cast in a way though wishing that journey never happened probably should've been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night ugh
<START> the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle at first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity themed morality comedies of cecil b de mille but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense br br as well as being a student of the german expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery this is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo and like eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound Â for example when a split second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring br br there is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the us in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards as much as possible is conveyed by imagery and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters' speech and it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with point of view shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices particularly double exposures many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in the lodger br br let's make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors first up the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist but that just goes to show how much i know as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting playing his rival is the competent ian hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian hall davis torn between two lovers she pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and it's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role br br the ring's climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent era hitchcock martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull as his watchword for these scenes was stay inside the ring the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with close ups and point of view shots hitchcock's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character's fear or paranoia br br the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger it's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features
<START> strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over appears to be an interesting take on beauty and the beast it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era br br corsets castles rutting horses rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods proof that no one had a brazilian in the 70's and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at what more could you possibly want br br it certainly brightened my sunday afternoon
<START> bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance br br visually stunning in some parts but that's about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel br br if you're really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper
<START> this murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and plausibility based on a stage play by broadway showman earl carroll and others it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage ambiance a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theatre where a musical revue is being staged br br the cast is impressive and varied tough goofy victor mclaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never fails to leer idiotically at whatever showgirl happens to be in sight jack oakie the prewar jack lemmon Â or was jack lemmon the postwar jack oakie as the harassed director who must coordinate the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes the ever homely jessie ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep dark secrets dorothy stickney who has a stunning close up monologue near the end as the tremulous maid madly in love with the male lead carl brisson the danish star as that very male lead warbling the classic cocktails for two not once but twice kitty carlisle operatically delivering where do they come from and where do they go and other johnston coslow songs the glorious gertrude michael who parted from us too soon as a mean spirited showgirl whose love for brisson is spurned the usually ridiculous toby wing who here at least is the center of a laugh getting running joke br br when the plot complications get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or fun and tuneful musical number to distract the viewer the film's most celebrated sequence is the marahuana number led by michaels but aside from its controversial history it's really one of the lesser musical offerings all of the songs here are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard proscenium theatre space as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setup of the busby berkeley style
<START> i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean pow camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and let's not forget enduring torture they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair with the exception of a suitably austere looking harry morgan as an army major the casting and acting are simply awful ronald regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles a mostly caucasian cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly russian officers acting as advisors to the koreans strut around wearing re badged nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots obvious costume department recycles from wwii flicks and speaking with accents like general burkhalter from hogan's heroes well that's just six kinds of silly don't waste your time on this one

<START> 'p' or club p should really be called <UNK> for lame every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much hyped logline thai lesbians fighting monsters rather this is the tale of a khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd but specific rules don't walk under a clothesline don't eat raw meat and don't accept money for your powers well guess what folks the girl moves to bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services br br while this film can't even be released in thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this ho hum horror pic a cross between showgirls and interview with the vampire as directed by walt disney br br if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for pre teens only there is literally broadcast tv adult fare although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a thai porn star in real life br br as for the 'lesbian' angle there's one brief smooch and a couple of i love you's to prove that the two main stars really are a couple on brother and the p bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ooh phallic imagery br br no nudity no real monster unless you count a five foot high thai spirit with yellow eyes and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd you've been warned
<START> at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 1957 dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid over the top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind the 1956 potboiler adapted from robert wilder's novel was a veritable three ring circus showcasing alcoholism greed impotence and nymphomania br br malone's performance as marylee hadley a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the lowest common denominator melodrama written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk an Ã©migrÃ© from pre world war 2 weimar germany who left his european theater heritage behind to pursue a career in hollywood br br an extremely erudite man sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as universal studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with ross hunter's productions of magnificent obsession all that heaven allows and imitation of life independent producer albert zugsmith offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult sensational product hence the sultry wind and its follow up 1957's tarnished angels both released under the universal international banner it's anyone's guess why sirk didn't pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities written on the wind could be considered sirk's epic soap opera indeed it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous perhaps more so robert stack not an actor typically known for over emoting nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak willed brother kyle hadley a mere shadow of his patriarchal father when he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride a beautifully leonine lauren bacall hadley goes off the deep end escalating an already serious drinking problem with a secret gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb both brother and sister as venal and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous and far more interesting than the 'good side of the family mainly bacall and the impossibly handsome rock hudson young hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and malone' s unattainable object of desire despite all the domestic co dependency on display it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed with a real panache for pictorial composition and editing director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened technicolor cinematography imaginable every single shot in this film is an eye filling canvas of saturated colors from the sight of a tank like pink cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury miami hotel a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity action and dramatic scenes feature sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles shadowy lighting and cross cut editing shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious drunken malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold what you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius
<START> lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii then he quipped the less said about that the better indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter it was a film to be taken seriously like other good original films filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front there is absolutely nothing scary about it it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning okay i'll cede ferdy mayne too lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things check out that ending with him and stirba lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania the story isn't really worth examining here and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise sybil danning is here and yes she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again one reviewer said 17 times i counted ten but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point i gave the film three stars but it really deserves a zero the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms danning's contributions yuck
<START> ok i admit i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie but beyond his good looks the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plot br br starting out we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie one a headmistress very concerned about her image and never married a police officer with child and a bad ex to go on about the third a power status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's br br they are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour characters set the movie continues br br mcdowell's character the headmistress arrives late at a funeral where a young organist filling in for the regular player doughty catches her eye what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief will they live happily ever after br br a tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type the end uplifting but maybe not what you'd expect all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror
<START> ben stiller doesn't so much act as react and he does it very well he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him in there's something about mary the stand up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face when he confronts mary's other two suitors he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious br br in along came polly the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few having said that hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile noticeably through stiller's reaction however everyone seems to be acting in a bubble there is very little reaction hoffman and stiller's characters could have played off each other much much more aniston again reprises her rachael role but stiller is no ross it is more of a joey with a crush on rachael scenario br br polly is a by the numbers rom com and that is its failing it lacks heart you don't root for the characters with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night but you'll regret forking out cash to see it
<START> on paper this movie would sound incredibly boring the idea of a 75 year old man traveling the country side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight story br br the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl she's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out alvin tells her a story about his own kids long ago he had them each take a stick and break it which they could easily do then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them that bundle he said is family so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger the straight story realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions br br alvin's journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly un hollywood character interactions each interaction is full of warmth and humor and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother lyle who has suffered a stroke and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey it's a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and ours it's a slow simple relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of america br br the straight story is the rare live action g rated movie that truly should not be missed grade a
