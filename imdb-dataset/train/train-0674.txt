<START> who knew they could be so funny christopher meloni and janel moloney are known more for their outstanding work in some of television's hottest dramas law order svu and the west wing put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughs br br the actors develop the story's ongoing relationship with impressive skill leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer meloni despite the fact he's a standup comic who also happens to be a mean spirited sexist jerk br br you'll be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases thea moloney halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart they have so little in common but when barry finally opens his heart you'll wonder why thea keeps running away br br the souler opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer well worth your time br br
<START> i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re sight all of the dialogue and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh i think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a children's film that is why i would still definitely give it 10 10
<START> i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious stammer overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie br br along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him br br he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie br br tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across br br there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don t know much about parrots br br kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially parrots are not disposable pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured br br so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist br br enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts
<START> one of scorsese's worst an average thriller the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho the finale is typically of this genre i e over the top with yet another almost invincible immune to pain villain i didn't like the 60s original and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake then again considering how bad his recent movies have been i'm referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl di caprio this isn't even that bad by comparison and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse
<START> after watching the next action star reality tv series i was pleased to see the winners' movie right away i was leery of such a showcase of new talent but i was pleasantly surprised and thrilled billy zane of course was his usual great self but corinne and sean held their own beside him it was also nice to see jared and jeanne also from the competition in their cameo roles sean's character not billy's is the hunted and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played corinne walks the tightrope well between her character liking sean's and only being in it for the money i loved how the game was played right to the last second and then beyond not a great movie but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate
<START> i usually try to construct reasonably well argued critiques of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best br br i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it started br br the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage
<START> in fact it never was i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy what a vacuous shambles none of these people come close to a cary grant spencer tracy katherine hepburn etc and anyway today's audience isn't as receptive to this facile muck writing is trivial the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious the chemistry between the leading characters is non existent it's interesting that julia roberts seems to think she's a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of hollywood whenever that may be it's an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride
<START> for die hard judy garland fans only there are two 2 numbers that are really good one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady you've all seen the pics and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout but it's worth the 2 50 to rent the movie just be prepared to fast forward it
<START> model chris mccormack margaux hemingway is brutally raped by a teacher chris sarandon of her sister kathy mariel hemingway he is brought to trial but goes totally free he then rapes kathy br br objectionable and sick rape film this movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama it purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face to be totally honest however hemingway's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had the trial scenes were boring and predictable and the movie just went too far when 15 year old mariel is raped thankfully that wasn't shown i do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when margaux grabs a gun and shoots sarandon dead but seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting br br acting doesn't help for instance margaux was no actress she was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model i believe but her acting left a lot to be desired it lessens the film mariel was just ok but this was one of her first films sarandon does what he can as the rapist he wasn't bad but the terrible script worked against him br br i do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people i found this boring simplistic and really sick a 1 all the way
<START> a young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration his overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes a young doctor uses reptilian dna he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm admittedly the special effects in severed ties are pretty good and grotesque but the rest of the film is awful the severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people big deal the acting is mediocre and the climax is silly 3 out of 10
<START> br br the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed i've seen it at least 10 times this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made the film begins with margaret karen kopins trying to find her sister her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing along comes jake speed wayne crawford telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her jake speed is a hero he doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure his partner dennis christopher follows him around and writes their adventures into novels this film is a great adventure it's hilarious it's action packed it's just great i guess it's a cult film with a very small cult following crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one liners that you'll never forget kopins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick respectively john hurt the guy who's stomach blew up in alien plays the devilish pervertish villian which just adds to the fun in many ways this film is similar to indiana jones in some ways it's similar to james bond films maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it's title is it's a very enjoyable film
<START> holy this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something i once witnessed a cow crap in a field i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows it might have moved or something well that was time better spent than watching this tripe the acting was non existent the plot was somewhere other than on this film i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs it's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal bah i can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack walk to your car start the engine then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself br br by the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it he dint come over she had too whats worse is that she had to watch this thing twice i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month i hope it was because of this film
<START> pet sematary succeeds on two major situations first it's a scary horror movie those that just aren't produced in these days second it's an emotional clever movie overall so if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting dialongs and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan br br probably the best adaptation to any of king's novels the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror drama accomplishment br br stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title pet sematary does not offers appiness a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere now it turns very dark the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life and pet sematary proves it dramatically br br the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot sadly enough the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much much worse what will happened with the lives of our all american family could pascow prevent this tragedy what is it with the surreal nightmares br br watch pet sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional horror movies of recent times you won't regret the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation but that's just my opinion denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts shivers overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperation br br something is for sure i don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
<START> at your video store you might find this gem br br the human condition in modern times la no exaggerated drama just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time br br helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life br br the direction and cutting are top class cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation and the cast br br excellent casting and excellent acting no one out of place or out of character br br and it's not really as much a downer as you would expect i gave it 7 of 10 br br if you havent seen it do
<START> titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes br br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 1912 at 11 39 an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2 18 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic br br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic's officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss' not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of 1912 the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money' such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking br br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter br br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film br br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you br br
<START> as someone else has already said here every scene in this film is gem most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect but director jewison hit a home run every time the cast got just the right take on the excellent script and in addition dick hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film the comedy is subtle mostly and the camera work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative cher is such a comedy natural vincent gardenia who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off broadway in the 80's deserved far greater stardom than he ever got and aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast has jewison ever written about this film br br would love to read it hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low
<START> anyone that has see tammuz's child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot telefilm anyone and that is was a case of second feature jitters the characters are one dimensional and over used the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully br br the cinematography is great shot almost entirely outside the images are crisp and beautiful you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves br br technically this movie is as sound as they come it just lacks a heart
