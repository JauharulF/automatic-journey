<START> if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out
<START> before i comment about this movie you should realize that when i saw this movie i expected the typical crap horror b movie and just wanted to have fun jack frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that i've seen in a long time scott mcdonald is great as jack frost in fact i think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements as soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people though you will find it hard not to laugh the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny the fact that the rest of the cast completely over acts just adds to stupidity of the film but it's stupidity is it's genius the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in b movie horror film fashion i truly hope there is a sequel and i'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it of course it's only fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology but i just like to see snowmen kill people i gave it a 7 out of 10 this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours
<START> this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie the story is wrong and a complete lie there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry the marxist leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts br br never ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen mccarthy read ann coulter's book treason for a better look at the truth about sen mccarthy br br it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http www thenewamerican com tna 1996 vo12no18 vo12no18 mccarthy htm
<START> charming in every way this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good if you love jazz music it is a must see if you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there's no tomorrow this film is for you if you are looking for an intense deep heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by darren aronofsky in other words reviewer djjohn lighten up don't you know a good time when you see one my only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short i guess i'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill
<START> this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600's obviously reincarnated god is an impersonal force animal life and plant life are all the same this is pantheism redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for 10 00 will show you how to start your own religion as one famous prophet has said use the force luke
<START> goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised it isn't completely faithful to the book but does it have to be no not at all john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol after inspector morse this is thaw's finest hour he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother the script and music made it worth the buy and you also see thaw playing the organ amazing the most moving scene was willie finding out about zak's death and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina buy this you'll love it 10 10 bethany cox
<START> i can't figure al pacino out i watch him in the godfather scarface carlito's way and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years then i see him in two for the money any given sunday and revolution and i wonder what the guy is thinking br br i stumbled on revolution a few nights ago and thought i would invest the next two hours on this here is a news flash want to get prisoners to talk force them to watch this over and over they'll confess to anything br br i won't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does while he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue together br br quite frankly if al smith starred in this movie instead of al pacino it would have ruined their career the script was horrible but pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse donald sutherland's role was laughable i really can't describe it natasha kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie in fact nobody speaks much in this movie br br one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield its like the entire northeast is a starbucks hey funny to see you here again on another battlefield 100 miles away see you in a few months br br i am required to give this one star by imdb since there is nothing here for a negative score
<START> okay i remember watching the first one and boy did it suck after watching it i just laughed it off and told myself oh boy just another low budget b movie i'll never see a part 2 to this one then about 1 1 2 years later there came part two it sucked even more but i just laughed it off again and said there's no way i'm ever gonna see a part 3 to this one then about 1 2 a year later part 3 came out i was stupid enough to rent it and boy i just snapped after watching it god i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days just save yourself 7 50 and don't rent the whole series trust me it's worth every penny
<START> i'm tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy it's a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history braveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicans all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
<START> a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw it's worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card made more piquant when we're not quite sure the card is not maxed
<START> this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 the way santa looks have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and 2 the evil rep of satan pitch's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh i can't believe this is a children's movie
<START> this was a favorite of my childhood i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during abu's fight with the giant spider my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider poppa just watch you'll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma br br i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief and not the grown up king in fact if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit the king is the thief's sidekick not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys br br it's definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless love struck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
<START> i loved this movie and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it or so it seems no this movie is not deep who cares these kinds of movies never are but strangely there is a message in it it's that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be br br parker posey is great in this movie i've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn so it's great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians hepburn's is the desk set all librarians especially those with a sense of humor should see party girl br br i gave this movie an 8 it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards although there are some nice shots in it but it is incredibly charming and entertaining
<START> difficult to call the grudge a horror movie at best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments br br if one forgets the failed frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie he is again disappointed the acting is ok but not great the story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning while one is trying to get what's happening but toward the end one understands there is not much to understand scary elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason br br so yawn see this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds
<START> it wasn't me it was er my twin brother rupert bobby says to dugan when confronted about being over at sally's place i have used this line dozens of times over the years no one has yet to believe it though br br this movie is one of the all time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan so much so that he was in 1978's malibu beach as the same character not nearly as much screen time though br br nobody calls dugan a turd is another line for the ages this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission
<START> on stage tv or in a book 'the woman in black' is an outstanding ghost story other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film but i thought i would add my belated little review too the made for tv movie has a deliberately slow first act which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s london i can understand why this might not appeal to all palates nevertheless for me i love this british style of storytelling similar to any of the bbc's ghost story for christmas adaptations of the great m r james' work in the second act the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client the third act relentlessly builds up to a spine tingling conclusion as a londoner i have seen the play i own the book dvd r and have the unabridged audio book on my ipod too what is sure for me 'the women in black' on any medium is a ghost story with few equals it is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 dvd release
<START> will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets let's give you 30 000 to make a movie and see what you come up with the guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free sure the acting is laughable at times yes the make up is not greatest you'll ever see but it's not the worst either if you want to see that go watch zombie nation with it's raccoon zombies br br this is pure good old fashioned guerilla film making todd is a consummate professional and an all around nice guy there are holes in the plot yes the plot does seem far fetched but what the hell i still love this movie i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to if anyone has ever tried to make a movie they know that just finishing it is an achievement in and of itself
<START> this is a film where the actors are all fine especially brigitte bako and erik palladino in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion in other words it feels like they are contrived movie scenes not like real life even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers it just doesn't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film also when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film it feels artificial the way they look at each other seconds after arguing again the actors are all good and moments of this film are nice but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling
<START> br br artisticly shot actors portray exactly their role you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times and can very well say that prix de beute' the beauty prize miss europe is a major favorite in my silent film collection the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line
<START> one of the worst films i have seen to date pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help the only good point is gary busey's parts but this does not lift the film very much it lives up to its b film ranking and passes the test with flying colours a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete refund br br really bad br br 1 10
