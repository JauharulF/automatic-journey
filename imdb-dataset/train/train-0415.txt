<START> john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film anna farris was par for the course not good but not horrible plus she's cute dianne keaton should have known better jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie even though it was poor judgement on his part as well br br all in all i would avoid this at all costs i'm just glad i didn't pay to see it br br john heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid ' unless he does some serious work on his acting chops
<START> from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically
<START> ok so there's nudity but hey there's free porn on the internet for whomever likes it and its just silly how they forced tits into every frame i mean i was embarrassed not from the nudity but from the far fetchessness of the producers writers of this piece of crap br br the movie is not funny at all its just extremely predictable all the time there is no plot no dramatic content at all this is way waay worse then the other pie films and they arnt that great either if you're really drunk or maybe a 13 year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable otherwise not br br may it forever roth align with crap of the same magnitude with regards erik the questmaster flash mc
<START> good times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the chicago projects whether or not you live in the inner cities ghettos suburbs or rural countryside this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family but they don't dwell on it they find humor and have strong family values and morals despite the story behind the scenes this show was worth keeping on the air except i didn't like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther rolle who fought hard to keep the family together but despite all the fights behind the scenes good times was a show about a family we all loved jj's dynamite and his antics we watched janet jackson's penny grow up a little this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs gangs and alcoholism without being to preachy the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto
<START> a half hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo playboy magazine subplot presley is surrounded by the same old coy winking clichÃ©s a woman picks e p up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life and he doesn't seem to care dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar but don porter and rudy vallee try hard as elvis' two bosses he's moonlighting you see some of the songs are quite good especially almost in love but if you want to see a looser hipper updated elvis sex comedy look elsewhere when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together there's actually a wooden board in between them get real from
<START> this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen i'm not exaggerating i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves the only thing interesting about this movie is the box on the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so i figured eh whatever if this was made recently i'm sure the directing at least won't be too bad but after i saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers br br anyway i think that they just liked the name zodiac killer and didn't bother to research any of the actual zodiac's crimes or his mo or even the years that he was active all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the stories about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac's crimes did they also compare the zodiac to vampire of dusseldorf fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz's son quite often the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks none of the haarman facts are correct either just a bunch of jumbled nonsense his son even says don't forget his name was fritz haarman with 2 t's his actual name just has one i think that the writer director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman ooh those sound like cool names let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research great idea br br perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm iv and getting cured of it i was also diagnosed with dsm iv and have since recovered etc for those of you who don't know dsm iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems haha br br anyway my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point but if you are interested in watching a totally non fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational i'd say check out this movie br br oh and i liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice nice touch
<START> before seeing this movie please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7 8 000 muslim men were bused out of srebrenica and shot by serbian paramilitaries the documentarian also belongs to various pro serbian american organizations please watch this movie critically and read reviews beforehand most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war a review in the nytimes by stephen holden states that it would be inaccurate to label this documentary pro serbian but one should question both the presentation of facts many of which are taken from reliable sources and the omission of those facts that inculpate serbian forces i do not advise against seeing this documentary but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye as one should do at all times anyway
<START> the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma films br br did you ever get bored of those hollywood style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of fed up with the married living single cop the divorced but family man the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ever wondered how the real police work is like br br well for germany this film shows you set in the north between west germany and east germany former ddr an laid off post office clerk starts her job fresh from policeschool she quickly finds her way around the usual customers and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman but this is not much fun br br other german crime films like derrick der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view even more if you know that part of germany a bit
<START> in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap no script no dialogues no acting and the brave colonel rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid proctor from the police academy so this was a complete waste of time fortunately not waste of money as i saw the film on tv and i really cannot understand 7 people who graded this sh t 10 they must've joked my advice if you see this title run from it
<START> as far as the movie goes it's an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said it's not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched br br as for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete bullsh t this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people androids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch br br i gave this a 3 because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all br br watchable for those who have not seen cube hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series
<START> while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip an abused suburban housewife basinger finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn br br suffering the indignity of a straight to dvd release here in the u k susan montford's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves this is a shame as the standard of the writing directing and acting is very good indeed and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick br br kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband craig sheffer while sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence it is in their brief scenes together that basinger connects showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths it's a truly great understated performance her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played br br lukas haas i initially thought was miscast as he along with the other three youths just did not seem much of a threat however had all four youths been more physically imposing the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all the fact that these are four average men albeit slightly unhinged is the key to why the film works as well as it does br br apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over some may be put off by the slow burn nature of the opening scenes or the abrupt ending others by the at times brutal violence i say give it a chance it's certainly more deserving of your time than saw v
<START> i just saw this film in santa barbara my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought i'd check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little strange but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left the theater thinking about the film it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique
<START> the famous international conductor daniel darÃ©us michael nyqvist has a heart attack with his stressed busy professional life and interrupts his successful career with an early retirement he decides to return to his hometown in the north of sweden from where his mother left when he was a seven year old sensitive boy bullied by conny and other school mates to live a low paced life he buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local shepherd stig niklas falk but the reluctant and shy daniel refuses in the principle however he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by lena frida hallgren a local woman with a past with the local doctor his music opens the hearts of the members of the choir affecting their daily life the slow tore andrÃ© sjÃ¶berg has the chance to participate in the choir inger ingela olsson the wife of stig releases her repressed sexuality gabriella helen sjÃ¶holm takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband the gossiper and frustrated siv ilva lÃ¶Ã¶f opens her heart against lena the fat holmfrid mikael rahm cries enough against the jokes of the businessman arne lennart jÃ¤hkel even daniel starts loving people and lena as the love of his life when they are invited to participate in an important contest in vienna daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true br br sÃ¥ som i himmelen is a touching and sensitive movie with a very beautiful story it is impressive how director kay pollak and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in 132 minutes running time the performances are top notch supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments when gabrielle sings her song in the concert and certainly the last concert in vienna with the audience jury and everybody participating in the melody and daniel making his dream come true like in teorema the stranger changes the lives not of only a family but of a conservative community further like many european movies the open conclusion indicates that daniel actually died at least in my interpretation reaching peace with the success of his music my eyes became wet in these two scenes my vote is nine br br title brazil a vida no paraÃ­so the life in the paradise
<START> maiden voyage is just that i'd like to say straight away that i watched 5mins of this before i just couldn't stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesn't fall into the whole so bad it's good thing it's just bad the acting is awful the sfx are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols br br don't even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed
<START> in hazzard county georgia cousins bo and luke duke scott knoxville and their cousin daisy duke jessica simpson run moonshine made by their uncle jesse willie nelson while avoiding the local authority boss hog burt reynolds their problems with the boss are only beginning as they learn he's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it br br i have never seen the tv show and after watching the movie i'm not going to start any time soon i like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through the second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity the film focused on bo and luke way too much the characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job br br the acting wasn't very good i wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny seann william scott and johnny knoxville both give below average performances the latter was pretty good as stifler but he tries way too hard here the latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else jessica simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing she's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things she is pretty but she's a weak actor it doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything willie nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special br br the screenplay was written by john o'brien and he made two films prior to the dukes of hazzard the first one was cradle to the grave which was okay the second one was starsky and hutch which was pretty funny he doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess he also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better the movie is also pretty long for a comedy okay 106 minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour i think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time the dukes of hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes the car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film in the end dukes of hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it rating 4 10
<START> the first was good and original i was a not bad horror comedy movie so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it br br what really makes this movie work is judd nelson's character and the sometimes clever script a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy look br br great made for tv movie it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson's stanley doing what he does best br br i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
<START> someone mentioned editing this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess for starters let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in and what exactly are they testing apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit the acting is pretty bad everyone is emoting everyone is keeping secrets they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money they'd hang it up there's a deranged minister who spouts scripture on and on but again the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors there are some really cheesy elements those little rooms and those chaise lounges the awful wallpaper was it wallpaper it was interesting but didn't seem to go anywhere
<START> my abiding love of italian actress lucianna paluzzi who helped jump start my puberty with her performance in 1965's thunderball has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british curiosity from 1959 carlton browne of the f o which features lucianna in one of her earlier roles she plays a princess in this one although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terry thomas and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this cute often very funny film we learn of the madeira like island nation of gaillardia which had been a british colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten forty three years later however it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there and her majesty sends the bumbling carlton browne of the foreign office to take charge terry thomas underplays this part nicely as does sellers in his role as prime minister amphibulos of the tiny country this was sellers' second film of 1959 concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world the other being the mouse that roared of course ian bannen almost steals the show here as gaillardia's suave king and my girl lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role the film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor although there are some belly laughs to be had the reception at the gaillardian airport for example and especially that may day style parade of gaillardian strength and sellers' seedy prime minister with his cracked english and seemingly perpetual sweat stains is yet another memorable character in this great actor's pantheon despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable stiff upper lip british gibberish i found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment and well presented on this crisp looking anchor bay dvd
<START> i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the story telling i am still a fan with some minor pains br br though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything sound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans especially the character called wufei i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera get a counselor will ya br br besides for the over exaggerated drama i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seed eeeewwww talk about mellow dramatic i'll chat about that one later
<START> of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film so many fine things to see one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist luzhini's turturro's ex mentor working his evil on the sidelines his chess opponent an italian dandy in three piece and cane turns out to be a real gent and a truly fine chess player to his credit the opponent nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously luzhin has taken a flyer out a window sad but so releasing to him by way of the unstable genius' widow emily watson in death then because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master luzhin's defence which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity is allowed to be played the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant talk about a dramatic end game
