<START> do you guys wanna know a secret this movie sucks well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies then perhaps you may find this movie astounding this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer the first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting a bunch of so called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are the only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters the second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no where near unprecedented killings the third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show as far as the story is concerned it can easily be explained in a few lines a bunch of teenagers go to florida on vacation while they are busy partying they slowly and i mean slowly begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret the only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school one thing that did however amaze me about this movie was how much betty im not sure about her name the blonde character looks like reese witherspoon another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times does that make it a work of art absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she boo'ed me when i was just about to go through the guest room door whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece br br do you wanna know a secret i'm not sure about you guys but i don't
<START> a family mother patricia clarkson father jake weber son erik per sullivan go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter they accidentally hit a deer while driving there this angers some of the locals especially otis john speredakos and things slowly very slowly go wrong br br i was expecting the worst when i started watching this the bulk of the reviews for this on this site are extremely negative well i disagree first off it's not a horror film the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in on that level it's pretty damn good br br first the bad stuff the pace is way too slow jake weber is a horrible actor way too many false dream sequence scares the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable br br the good stuff pretty good dramatic script clarkson is excellent as the mother some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot pretty good acting by sullivan only 10 at the time and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending br br i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film which it isn't so if you can ignore that i think you might like it i'm giving it a 7
<START> sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood now he wants to broaden his horizons and spoiler needs a family member in order to do it br br a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many wisecracks that's for sure the actors aren't interesting save robert englund as always and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto and there are simply far too many visual effects the finale is ok but doesn't provide as many sparks as i think one might hope br br in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story it provides englund the opportunity to do more non makeup scenes than ever before br br there are cameos worth noting a joint cameo by then couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shock rocker alice cooper and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become br br film debut of breckin meyer who plays spencer br br one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits br br 4 10
<START> it has been said a city on hill cannot hide itself and virginia city nevada perched on the side of mt davidson at 6200 ft west of tahoe is a prime example or in the context of the movie should be virginia city exploded in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver suspiciously the same year the civil war began it was the birthplace of the dean of american letters it was where a young reporter named samuel clemens began using the name mark twain and went on to become america's most famous writer it was also the birthplace of the great hearst fortune and the launching pad of john mackay who became the wealthiest man in america the third wealthiest man in the world hey they should have made the movie about him in the 1860's virginia city was the boomtown of all boomtowns the home of the big bonanza at one time the largest metropolitan area west of st louis and east of san francisco but virginia city the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash north south duello between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott flynn is capt kerry bradford a union officer who is a pow in a concentration camp run by a mean confederate commander named capt vance irby played by scott these two are always getting in each other's way bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of vc by who else other than irby hey what's he doing here horrible bogart plays a laughable mexican bandit who can't decide who's side he's on miriam hopkins plays a murky character named julia hayne obviously a historical lunge at the town's first lady julia bulette who in real life a celebrated prostitute she goes to washington and talks honest abe about saving bradford not irby from hanging and blah blah blah go figure they shoulda hung the writer in real life twain reports that on the last day of the war the setting sun caused the american flag atop mt davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire kind of like the movie three days later they discovered that on that day the south capitulated one interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks alan hale and guin williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot like they're fishing or trying to make the bullets go faster not a bad idea for the movie the same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie gosh how could they miss the gold madness profligate wealth gun battles in the silver mines mark twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown the crooked railroad the opera house fire artemis ward bulette's huge funeral the chinese tongs the black saloons the auction all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert the truth was unreal did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust well if you count this movie it wouldn't be the first debacle to come out of virginia city it's a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a city of illusions where it is said evil seeps out of the ground okay other than that it's a fun movie flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying if flynn would just play his rotten self i'd double my rating
<START> i have read the book and i must say that this movie stays true to form i think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho cristina raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and burgess meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next door neighbor i have seen this movie at least twice and i think that i am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection the suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming if you like movies like signs and the village the sentinel will be a classic prelude also what is interesting is the actors in the movie you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits the late jerry orbach is great as the commercial director and jeff goldblum is excellent as the photographer also there is beverly d'angelo who is underrated but great
<START> though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series bulldog drummond escapes this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of ray milland br br that said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying also john barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises br br anyway it's another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining
<START> watching this again recently i found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure by any objective measure this was a disaster but i found it easy to imagination how good a lord of the rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers unfortunately thanks to jackson that will not be possible for a long time br br watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all then this story simply couldn't be stuffed up fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film there were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that peter jackson did it although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution the way they tried to show the wraith world from frodo's point of view for example or the way that galadriel showed sam what was happening back home for another br br another thing i really appreciated in this version the silent moments there were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back drop compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the jackson films and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched jackson's films were full of their own importance this was quieter and a lot more modest br br jackson and co hit this with more than us 270 million dollars in production costs at least 90 million dollars more for marketing a massive tax break from the nz government and also gained massive savings from filming in nz not the usa however despite the marketing claims the intention to be faithful was never there this is well documented philippa boyens said as much in an interview when she said they deliberately didn't re read the books before writing the script jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film along the lines of the lord of the rings and that the one he really wanted to do was return of the king because it had a lot of battles but no character development br br in contrast this film tried to be more true of course a lot of things were wrong the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything and the pace was too fast naturally they cut a lot and adapted other scenes and for this they deserve credit while jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway there's actually a curious similarity between the structure of the jackson and bakshi films near the beginning in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way although of course some of this could be coincidence br br this was not a good film but the potential was there bakshi said in an interview to the onion av club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice his version didn't work but he might have been right
<START> but lets face it it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me br br the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups i get a new season and just power through them like i have 2 days to live i like the idea of wrapping it up but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following br br dr cox isn't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes only explanation i can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re shoot the beginning br br and that my friends is why the hell cox is bald br br anyways the show is awesome bring on the 7th season
<START> world's finest is an unique project it's a trailer for a superman batman crossover movie that doesn't exists and will also never exists at least not in this form with these characters actors and plot line anyway br br so the movie is one big tease even more than standards everyday real movie trailers the trailer will hype you all up for nothing in that regard i really didn't liked this short project when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad and perhaps you'll even feel cheated afterward when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place surely to show off sandy collora's skills but couldn't he had also done this with a real movie short like his earlier movie batman dead end br br but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is so from a movie technical point of view it's a really great one it's great looking and way more professional than you'll perhaps at first would expect although the people who've already seen batman dead end will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets cheap homemade costumes and third rate actors the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn't sky high but for most part it's very impressive and professional looking with nice costumes sets special effects cinematography and lighting br br the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey it works well for the trailer style it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones mainly the superman flying sequences it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car with a camera aimed at him from an angle below i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this br br michael o'hearn seemed like a pretty good superman clark kent although he obviously isn't the greatest talented actor around clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough br br it's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie in the movies batman begins and superman returns it's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one it's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey the actor who played lex luthor in superman returns br br it's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more even though you know that there won't be more whatever happened to the waner bros plans to create an actual full length superman batman movie by the way i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made batman begins and superman returns br br 7 10
<START> i love cinema so what i'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply i had given a thumbs down to che parts 1 and 2 without having seen the film terrible i know but i felt into a trap perpetrated by who i don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and no matter how smart i think i am i fell into it but thankfully i bumped into an argeninean film director martin donovan a man i love and admire when i told him i wasn't going to see it because i knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and donovan is a pacifist he took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why i went to see both parts straight away and che part 1 and 2 is the best film i've seen in 2008 it is of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past the regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore i don't know if we ever were riveting moving without concessions and benicio del toro is just extraordinary we can see his soul we can actually perceive it the humanity of the man is overwhelming so thank you martin donovan once again for educating me so honestly bravo del toro bravo soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film don't commit the mistake i was about to commit go see it now on the big screen
<START> i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born i was born in 1964 so i was 5 yrs old when seseme street was introduced to television the show taught me my numbers the count spelling the muppet and about life i liked all the old characters big bird oscar grover and cookie monster and don't quite understand why they had to change i understand that everything has to change in some way but to make cookie monster into a veggie monster to promote healthy eating the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it's inception why not make a separate veggie monster that talks discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with cookie monster but back to my point i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street my now 20 yr old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her and we discussed mr hooper dying although he had died prior to her being born as well as other topics on the show i saw the episode as a older child and still remember how well they portrayed the event much like real life and i'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events the show has talked about traditional families adoptive families and combined families it's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios i now have a 5 yr old daughter who really doesn't watch ss i've tried to watch the show a couple of times but it really is not what it used to be the elmo 1 2 hr with mr noodle is absolutely ridiculous like many people have said it doesn't teach anything it's geared for the less than 18 month old maybe and isn't even funny i always prided myself on watching ss as a child teen and adult with my own child now on my second go round i really have a hard time watching ss the topics that were discussed death marriage non traditional families new to neighborhoods moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2 99 year old to understand and relate to now there are no concepts taught minimal counting only the occasional mention of the alphabet it is not the same ss from an original watcher of the show please if any producers from the show read these comments return the show to its foundation new concepts have never been a problem with ss they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show
<START> with ralph bakshi most of his films appear to be like two edged swords you'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy the lord of the rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department br br fire and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view the rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it you still get some of the dull still cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over all the look has definitely gotten better since bakshi's last fantasy epic the animation has almost a realistic naturalistic style to it and unlike in lotr where this style was often at odds with the actual content here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere br br unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurred lorn and tigra are easy cases but even the main villain necron was difficult to follow not to mention that guy with furry face mask also known as just 'that guy' even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate there are some odd quirks in the audio department and tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming br br however i believe the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot line the scant clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously it's still a hella cool and really funny
<START> saw this as previous viewer by accident i have watched it twice now i thoroughly enjoyed it no silly thought provoking messages just plain good fun entertainment good songs good characters and a just a feel good film highly recommended to those of us that just like to enjoy films and not dissect them great fun for all the family here i didn't realise rosie alvarez is played by vanessa williams she is excellent and very sultry the songs like one boy and one last kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your feet to jason alexander is the complete contrast to his character in pretty woman ans is very good tyne daley still sticks in my mind from cagney and lacey and her voice and accent still had that remembrance in it overall i just loved it and will be looking to purchase it if it is available
<START> i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later category br br this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film howl's moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it br br the first third of the film reveals the post apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly veiled eco propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films br br overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an nth generation copy with poor colour which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused
<START> just another example of why stepehn king's books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better
<START> i watched this film alone in the dark and it was full moon outside i didn't do it in purpose it just happened in this way so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me well it didn't in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes but i thought come on give it a chance unfortunately i did the acting was awful the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong the plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before some scenes didn't make sense at all and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie the scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology yet some good movies were made back then i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent i couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got it is also my rating for it 3 out of 10
<START> hilarious laugh out loud moments and yet not a comedy i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the filthy bum who then shouts after them in anger you filthy bums i mean wow someone's online degree in literature is paying off the worst script imaginable with plot introductions in an instant ridiculous movement in the story zero character development even between the characters who meet it's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years dodgy voice over with added echo effects and plot holes oh god are there plot holes to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing but i certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of well use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence
<START> a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music this epitomizes the 80's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work personally i liked greensleeves and the other harsher characters they had some of the more amusing lines
<START> this is your standard musical comedy from the '30's with a big plus that it features some well known '30's actors in small fun cameo's br br there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and 'no worries' overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it appereantly it's a 'cinderella story' but i most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studios br br of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines it's like watching a movie and getting a laurel hardy short with it for free also laurel hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the short br br it's certainly true that all of the cameo's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character br br the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwise br br 7 10
<START> after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do
