<START> i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada and when it finally did i was very excited to see it i really enjoyed it of course in the beginning it is a very sad movie and it was new years day making it even sadder however it sticks with you the next day i was thinking about it again because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story how one person can be seen as the link to so many people but sometimes you can be blinded so many things and how diane keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there and how they save her in the process as well it was such an excellent movie and chris pine one of my favourite actors provides the perfect comic relief it is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues but will really stay with you for a long time
<START> i have seen some bad movies austin powers the spy who shagged me batman forever but this film is so awful so boring that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest a pity boasting talent such as kenneth branagh embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham what went wrong branagh is a big time lawyer who has a one night fling with davitz her father duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes somehow i couldn't figure out how robert downey jr daryl hannah famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary i wanted to like this and being a huge grisham fan have read all about this movie and i foolishly expected something interesting this is honestly the worst film i've seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded out of
<START> a family with dad louis dale midkiff mom rachel denise crosby 10 year old eileen blaze berdalh and about 3 year old gage miko hughes move to this beautiful house in maine seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so the neighbor across the way the wonderful fred gwynne makes them feel at home and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets but a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life but the dead come back in a nasty mood br br definite spoilers the novel by stephen king was good it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened this movie jettisons all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence animals are killed on camera i know it's faked but it's still repulsive a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral in a totally sick scene he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom i do wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her a ghostly jogger don't ask tries to help the family for no reason the movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face it just goes out of its way to shock you end spoilers br br acting is no help midkiff is just dreadful as the father he's handsome and buff but totally blank crosby isn't much better the two kids are just annoying only gwynne single handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting br br this picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things especially midkiff at the end this movie was inexplicably a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992 i saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what i saw a sick repulsive horror film a 1 all the way br br when you think it's all over and can't get worse the ramones sing a title song i don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery truly beyond belief
<START> the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title br br i honestly didn't like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i don't get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however it's visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises br br the movie's storyline is very simple most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts br br i will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit
<START> i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon com based on my other interests they hit the nail on the head with this one i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it ten years later it's like watching it all again for the first time lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together even though they are somewhat rivals almost representing good caleb and evil sherriff lucas buck i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be but let it suffice to say he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy he can make phones ring writing appear or even cause a person's emotions to change none the less there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all all in all this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of i e point pleasant threshold nowhere man and seaquest dsv just to name a few were cancelled way before their time the steven king's the dead zone sunday's usa network seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv so in the meantime i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch quality shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons what a bunch of crap that is
<START> working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi best known for writing the book wiseguy which he adapted into the movie goodfellas and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas who is regarded as a presidential prospect as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report his skepticism is agitated how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony franciosa the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge though there are never any misgivings that they are br br the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge one can't say it doesn't work the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off ramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center and the city's bid for the next democratic convention individual idiosyncrasies are also explored including aiello's emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammerstein br br much also is made of menschkeit a yiddish expression which pappas explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a handshake this connection doesn't mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law br br there are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy br br one scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he won't be wanted there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole pacino and his character both br br it gets an impressive reaction from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech br br pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man unbreakable and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that don't sway pacino is innate with his down to earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matter of fact realism cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness br br the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment
<START> at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any blokes who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i've seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can
<START> after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb i was extremely pleased with the film the film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon br br i had initially expected to see many special effects and like a lover's caress it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it brian i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects you will go a long way my friend i will definitely be the president of your fan club br br eric etebari the best actor award was the number one choice you made jr lopez look like a child compared to kasadya br br overall the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic i just wish it were longer i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations
<START> if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of it's the biopic always misleading filled with false information over dramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the aviator and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part i never doubted mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin up girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story director co writer marry harron and guinevere turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 9 10
<START> if this movie should be renamed it should be the jackasses of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 dodge charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the law br br i have been a fan of the dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key the overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer trash br br side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge charger named general lee the others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie br br the dukes have been another casualty of the 21 st century hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd br br my grade f
<START> this movie really i mean really sucks its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real i mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking wow someone actually made this movie then released it that takes guts whoever they are i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore br br when i hired this movie it wasn't in on dvd so i reluctantly took it out on video the first thing to appear was a lord of the rings trailer for the two towers this was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video it justifies me reluctantly giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars maybe the producers though the star attraction of dean cain i think thats how you spell it would draw in the crowds uh to the video store that is br br next they employed split screen technique like in hulk to i assume compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is on the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon does the dragon look exactly like the one in dragonheart or is it just me either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from gremlins 2 and has the cgi of a nintendo video game villain from the early 90's perhaps worse also not the dragons movement as it pursues its victims its the same f cking monotonous movement right leg left leg right leg left leg dom dom dom dom dom dom f king dooooom this just pisses me off maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of jaws why not then have a dragon pov shot either way that was just funny much like watching a weebl toon br br dean cain gives many puzzled looks during the film maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career don't expect superman here the first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a ps2 game br br as for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there oh and did i mention that i f king hate the people who made this incredibly stupid stupid crap atrocious film
<START> well how do you even rate a movie such as this one does it even have cinematic value really it's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really br br it's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking as well as sounding they are often just kicking into the floor rather than into the girl obviously also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame i mean if this was real surely she would had screamed it out there is more moaning than screaming in this one though br br the movie is obviously low budget and it's a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking with very limited resources don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released though it must had done something well since a total of six sequels got released after this one br br fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie br br 4 10
<START> enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adults br br glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella call me ella' de ville br br after three years in dr pavlov's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur Â even the puppy skin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits br br but it wouldn't be a Âdalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification and now she needs one extra puppy hence 102 dalmatians to complete her nefarious scheme this time round br br ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second chance' dog shelter though he was in titanic' and in last year's television version as pip of great expectations' i didn't recognize him well he was Âfifth officer lowe' in titanic' and i didn't see great expectations' so i am not terribly surprised br br gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier pawn of cruella he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen Â and does it well his 'wicked witch of the west' homage is hilarious br br tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella's not so evil henchman Â he was also Âalonzo ' cruella's butler in 101 dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the black adder' brit coms he plays his usual bumbling good hearted somewhat dim witted character to great effect br br oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing Â it is incredibly detailed note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic and worthy of such an over the top character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination br br animation holds a special place in my heart Â but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans it can't be done suffice it to say that 102 dalmatians' is even better than the film version of 101 dalmatians' that came out in 1996 there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting it is a good film for the whole family
<START> poor michael madsen he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick i really can't think of anything worse i have ever seen except amateur porn it's that bad and all here wooden acting bad script crappy moral ending you hate it and it is in this movie br br my question is who the hell put into this piece of doggy doo at least we could have seen michael's sister virginia nude in a scene but i don't think even that would save this stinker br br for a cool guy that has made some exception movies i want to know what wacky church sponsored this piece of crapola
<START> i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks but left feeling let down the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat that isn't to say it was all bad the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material but the director switched focus to the cliche'd save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot he would have come out with a much more memorable movie now to do the film justice i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster in fact the best kevin smith of clerks homage here was giving props to his hometown webster ny is to checkout what red bank nj is to clerks the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahou's trust me as far as things to do in rochester a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them
<START> im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul
<START> if you want to see women's breasts get a porno there is no plot but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny and yes boobs are boobs
<START> one thing that astonished me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded br br another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis' fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protest br br also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common br br overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact
<START> when it comes down to fairy tales cinderella was the one that made you cry the most poor cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave driving step mother and thanks to mr walt disney we got to witness cinderella in animation br br before the story begins cinderella and her father are lonely and rich beyond their needs to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters cinderella's dad marries a woman but then dies soon after the stepmother only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step daughter cinderella br br so for many days cinderella is a slave to her step mother and her step sisters she has hope however thanks to her friends the mice of the home sounds like cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck she has hope that one day she'll find her prince the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend br br 9 10
<START> quite typical for swedish movies of this type strange that the acting was soooo bad these actors usually give a good show the casting was poorly done it made you expect something i won't tell you what the lead character was awful i don't know where they find her anyway stay away from this and go see den tredje vÃ¥gen instead this is swedish action in is prime
