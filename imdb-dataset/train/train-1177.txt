<START> hurrah a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and high fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds br br the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the i'm right and you're all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote
<START> the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific according to this theory somehow related to the chaos theory i'm not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each others' lives the six degrees of separation theory can be applied as well each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely tuned and nuanced audrey tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement
<START> at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it in all honesty my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman when a new version of that just came out nice touch guys it was misleading enough to rope me in the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it the film looks like it was shot by a d grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes sometimes less is more buddy through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together well that makes it an exceptionally bad movie without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school but hey maybe i'm a bit biased i mean i did get to play an extra p s i don't even think this deserves a star not even a half none for you
<START> if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for you br br the concept of dark angel isn't anything new in fact there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish br br jessica alba is smoking and max' friends original cindy kendra are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it br br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you're looking for hard hitting award winning drama go watch the west wing or something
<START> in northeastern of brazil the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria fernanda carvalho sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization tadeu chico dias to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life however the girl is resold to the farmer lourenÃ§o otÃ¡vio augusto that deflowers her and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner the despicable saraiva antonio calloni when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life she is explored by the cÃ¡ften vera darlene glÃ³ria br br anjos do sol exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria last year i saw lilja 4 ever that tells an identical story in the former soviet union therefore this problem does exist in third world countries director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival most of the prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glÃ³ria so different she is after many plastic surgeries the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic my vote is ten br br title brazil anjos do sol angels of the sun
<START> no didn't think so well in that case all you have to do is stay far far away from do you wanna know a secret as it's just the umpteenth pointless post scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever the plot is extremely ridiculous the characters are insufferably dumb the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring as you can derive from the title already this film is mainly inspired by i still know what you did last summer as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like ikwydls is a complete mystery to me anyway at least that film could depend on the precious rack of jennifer love hewitt whereas the girls in this junk are apart from brainless also terribly unattractive one year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend beth morgan her new adulterous lover and four other simple minded college students go to florida to spend their spring break holiday in a fancy beach house the killer hasn't made a move all year but now he follows the posse to florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card you really don't need to be a horror expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing since the plot is so thin most of the film is purely irrelevant padding including the sub plots regarding the incompetent floridian police force and the 'mysterious' fbi inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle the murder inexplicably happen off screen don't you hate it when that happens there isn't even any gratuitous t a to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for good
<START> please do not let the cover of this movie fool you and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at this isn't it usually i will go for stupid if it's funny but this stupid was so stupid it almost or possibly did make me stupid br br the film quality is better than a handheld but not by much and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the samba 2 key on a casio keyboard these problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing weep cast and you have a real humdinger br br the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend he also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office on the way there they meet a female in distress who is then invited to come along by the other girls br br the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house br br from there you the audience and the morons um actors try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another overall i think i have made it sound better than it is the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped the plot contrived the acting bad and the motivations clueless once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas it is not br br the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie woah my nose just grew eight inches
<START> i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep
<START> in our household like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7 4 years old at the time and i 10 would watch this movie over and over again we all loved star wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song there are some slow moments the time spent with king koo koo in his court and we generally got bored after the knight's song the reason that i sound effect is because i loooooove you but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo koo floating there dominating the entire horizon laughing maniacally at the end i still to this day sing hooray for me babbette of gay paris around my friends i'm 33 now who just look at me as if i've lost my mind however when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars
<START> ronald colman plays a famous broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity after years of playing a wide range of parts he can't remember who he exactly is who are his roles and who is the self and much more serious he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life so since he's currently playing in othello he begins to act jealous and suspicious just like the title character ultimately it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder br br i saw this film years ago and liked it i just saw it again and loved it now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because i have always liked ronald colman and this is a great triumph for him and for which he earned the best actor oscar and looking at the competition that year gregory peck for gentleman's agreement john garfield for body and soul william powell for life with father and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra i think colman was a very good choice as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role br br now i noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated shakespeare and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him however this film isn't really about shakespeare and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike shakespeare i am no huge fan of shakespeare but marveled at the small portions of the play that colman re enacted though as i said this is not a really movie about shakespeare instead it's a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality it could have been any play though othello was an excellent choice because of the murder scene which gets acted out for real later in the film br br overall a very clever film due to a lovely script with some overtones of film noir fortunately the acting was terrific also as colman had excellent support from signe hasso shelly winters and edmond o'brien who was particularly good he played his part just right and considering the great george cukor was directing it's no wonder it's a wonderful film from start to finish
<START> it really is that bad of a movie my buddy rented it because he well is an idiot but then again i must be an idiot too because i watched the whole damn thing the actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places the only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at luby's all i could think of while i was watching this gem was how it actually got made i mean some screenwriter actually thought that this premise was fresh original and lucrative then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it actors were cast locations were scouted make up artists were hired computer animators fresh out of al collins graphic design school were brought in and this turd started to take form br br there obviously were a ton of things that i hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music every single minute of this flick was scored there was not a single break in music and at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything br br after it was over we decided to watch mystic river it was like driving a 1980 vw diesel rabbit then switching to a bmw 740il you couldn't get two more opposite movies in terms of quality
<START> a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over the cast is very good there's plenty of action and stewart gets the girl and his revenge with a twist in the end i've seen this film several times and always watch when it's on amc or cable highly recommended
<START> when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct br br i am a big fan of the wayans brothers i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks little man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale br br obviously the joke will revolve around marlon wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison he and his partner tracy morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington in order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond br br the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour all these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny br br the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok i mean it was not 100 believable but it was ok nothing great i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses br br wait for it on cable or television it really is not worth any amount of money
<START> this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke i personally don't care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her just as a movie this is something that wouldn't even get a passing grade in film school the script is a mess the acting is atrocious and the fact luke wilson co writer of bottle rocket did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking he did old school for crying out loud this doesn't even belong in the same state as my old school dvd please for whatever reason do not watch this i see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good but that frankly is too kind when will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to i hope ends soon the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors penelope ann miller rachel leigh cook luke wilson who are part of this dump as far as the plot well it is almost non existent and so poorly done and written yes i know it's another rehash i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this please whatever you do don't waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb jessica simpson you're pretty but stick to singing although i'm not much a fan of that either and whoever did this film i wouldn't put this on your resume 1 10 because you can't give a zero
<START> there's never a dull moment in this movie wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil mostly very funny sometimes even scary a true classic a movie everybody should see
<START> first nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child second the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes eva mendezes and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun br br however dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time
<START> if you want to see a mystery don't watch this though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of dynasty since the filmmaker focuses on character development i e long boring talks between stupid un involving characters some people can make fascinating movies without real action see exotica but not this one avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
<START> it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive i'm not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see
<START> what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days br br this was something with a budget but it just wasn't as much fun john astin of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic but he is supported by lame actors cheap special effects and unfunny gags br br the plot dr gangrene astin escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france the hero his french girlfriend and the gizmo like fuzzy tomato decide they are going to stop him br br forgettable direct to video nonsense
<START> what percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars answer too many this movie isn't like that it is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable br br downside br br not enough character development some plot lines left twisting in the wind br br upside br br forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives br br well acted by scott cohen judd hirsch susan floyd ato essandoh and elliot korte br br contains some good lighthearted humor
