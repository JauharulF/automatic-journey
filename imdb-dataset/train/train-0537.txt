<START> disney and the wonderful folks at pixar of course offer a nice humourous story combined with the best of computer animation i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs in 'antz' six but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists which i missed in 'antz' some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end so keep watching at the end it's worth it which were highly amusing and original the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer
<START> do you like stand up then stay away from this br br during the early rounds there are in fact good comics but unless they got some cute qualities they got a snowballs chance any controversial material and you are out and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians when i see who the crooked judges are letting in br br 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries half of the finalists have given me 0 laughs several of them have lifted their material elsewhere something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with br br it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been br br if the producers changed the name of the contest to last clown standing all my criticism would loose validity maybe an idea
<START> this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change as usual the lovers sally field as almost over the hill soap opera queen celeste talbert and kevin kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor jeffrey anderson are working at cross purposes seemingly unaware that they are madly in love etc owing a little to bette davis's margo channing in all about eve 1950 and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness kevin kline one of the more underrated leading men of recent years is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome vulnerable egotistical and lovable all at the same time br br the misadventures center around celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece aspiring actress cori craven elisabeth shue who turns out not to be her niece with ensuing plot complications cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to celeste and to jeffrey anderson as well but never mind br br as a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are robert downey jr soap opera director david barnes and cathy moriarty montana and nurse nan david barnes is oh so hot for her but she cares only about one thing getting rid of celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck celeste's career but through happenstance and or a perverse logic all his attempts go awry much to the delight of the viewer br br whoopie goldberg plays rose schwartz the show's chief writer and celeste's alter ego and confidant while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show br br i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen young doctors in love 1982 which burlesqued tv's general hospital and was pretty good soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by field kline and downy jr but see this for sally field who is outstanding
<START> a timeless classic wonderfully acted with perfect location settings conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie a simple story mingled with humor and suspense i wish that a video was available in britain i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with oh mr porter
<START> i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies especially as i'm such a cynic myself it's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the been there done that approach to every movie she sees i'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother daughter evening out far far better than going to see some brain dead chick flick which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy according to the demographics br br eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris a city i haven't visited in 20 years but i wish i had they are loosely linked by joining shots and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world some of the films work better than others but as other reviewers have said it never descends too far into kitsch some are funny some are sad some intriguing and some just plain puzzling i'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the flying tiger hidden dragon hairdressing salon some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning the vampire and the tourist for example possibly my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes paris look too good it can also be cold wet foggy indifferent and miserable or in summer baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction but i'm nit picking br br my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff absolutely perfect and very very funny without buscemi having to say a word i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch but it just stayed on the right side rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very very uncomfortable i thought both the bob hoskins fanny ardent piece and ben gazzara gena rowlands fell a bit flat but maggie gyllenhaal was good has she cornered the market in junkies i watched sherry baby last week br br but i felt the two social justice pieces for want of a better way of putting it worked very well by that i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town and then the film about the african migrant struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young new paramedic yet another murder statistic in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life every year i thought both pieces very well observed br br the final film 14th arrondissement in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris Â in very badly accented french Â to her night school french class moved me a perfect ending to a good intriguing if not quite great movie br br paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea but it works pretty well
<START> he now has a name an identity some memories and a a lost girlfriend all he wanted was to disappear but still they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built now he wants some explanation and to get ride of the people how made him what he is yeah jason bourne is back and this time he 's here with a vengeance br br ok this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society of course like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's the bourne suprematy is a super heroes story jason bourne is a captain america project like who's gone completely wrong in the first movie the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one he now fights against what he considers like evil after a person close to him has been killed his girlfriend in suprematy by them that's all a part of the super hero story including a character with realistic but still impressive he almost invincible super powers br br and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world there's no frontiers in the bourne's movies characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye is as in the best seasons of 24 an american enemy who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him funny how mad patriots are now the n 1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories br br beside all those interesting thematics the movie isn't flawless the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes but all that doesn't really matter for the bourne ultimatum is an action movie and the action scenes are rather impressive br br everyone here is talking about the waterloo scene and the tanger pursuit and everyone's right i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark visually inventive scenes lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics the bourne ultimatum is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick
<START> i'll be honest i finally checked this movie not because of the stars though they were reasonably watchable and compelling particularly the three leads or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service something i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show has yet to ever happen assuming that's true that's remarkable i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis well okay clark johnson one of my faves from homicide life on the street and a veteran mostly tv director i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average despite the possibilities br br veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison michael douglass has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez david rasche anyone remember sledgehammer his affair with the first lady kim basinger clearly one of the hotter first ladies we've ever had fictional or real is certainly not helping his standing he's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief kiefer sutherland almost still completely in 24 mode throw in some other pivotal service agents martin donovan and the foxy somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired if underwhelming results br br the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most myself included interested
<START> this is one strange hacked together film you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one i'm not surprised there's no credits on it who would want to be associated with this film the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over it all makes very little sense as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be and all the music was very ill fitting library music cheap i guess very very odd i might actually buy a dvd of it though if it could let me in on what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie
<START> i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago my sister told me i had to see it now my whole family has it memorized we quote it at least once a day i absolutly love this movie i still laugh after all this time sure it's about a really really drunk millionare that is irresponsible the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie and that he is willing to give it all up for love i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh a lot of laughs its hallarious sweet and if your a movie buff it will truely change your idea of funny watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head it will make you laugh for years to come br br it is really hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes but this movie i feel made us closer and i know it will do the same for you
<START> this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been on there the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it
<START> i really dislike both shrek films since their both pg and have words in them i would never say myself so i disliked them br br but when it comes to spirit stallion of the cimarron which i just barely watched for the first time last month i became a fan of animated films other than pixar spoilers ahead in spirit stallion of the cimarron a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard one night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sets off toward it this action eventually leads to his capture and several more things throughout the movie we hear a narration it's through the thoughts of spirit though the horses never talk this is what makes the movie so goo they the movie makers recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made none of those sounds were made by humans br br spirit meets rain a beautiful mare and little creek a native american who owns rain little creek later frees spirit and rain they go running home br br i have never been a big fan of brian adams but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future br br watch this film and you won't regret it my score 10 10
<START> i must say when i read the storyline on the back of the case it sounded really interesting but when i started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly
<START> hearing about how hilarious this movie is i finally rent it at br br the video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed 3 times this br br movie a collection of skits that make fun of television is an br br incoherrent mess the jokes fall flat the humor deals with br br issues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore and br br the jokes go on way too long almost like the new snl skits the br br past few years yeah chevy chase is in this but maybe of all br br about 1 or 2 minutes i liked the fact that this was very br br raunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny do br br yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a far br br superior film made in the
<START> i'll say it again this movie was totally lame kids will like it sure but adults doubtful the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original which is to be expected since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie but still did they have to completely rehash the entire movie i mean everything is re done from the little mermaid the worst part of it is morgana ursula's crazy sister who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody which is ridiculous since triton is there with his magic trident why didn't triton do anything about it because the plot required him to do nothing i could go on but i won't the whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid and was obviously thrown together without any thought because they knew it would sell overall it is a terrible waste of time
<START> this is a really strange film and that is not a bad thing it is a combination of a neo realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale i'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange but i loved it once again this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people not actors and gets a great ensemble type performance although not nearly as sad as umberto d both movies have a very similar point to make this one just does it in a very absurdist way ignore the cheesy special effects after all it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway or at least they shouldn't be in films instead just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride unless you are a total curmudgeon you'll have a ball br br by the way since i first reviewed this film i have seen another desica directed film that is an absolute must see and that is the children are watching us while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan a great film nevertheless
<START> wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believable br br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town she's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a big time actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigans as this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor and the actor dies as a result he's convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs aren't to be found so she's forced to take any job even burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kid but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10 000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can 10 000 get him out otherwise maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wow this is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not there's quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds br br this is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing' throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis' best efforts it's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot it's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not good br br by the way the child who plays francis' daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to be i think
<START> i really have no idea how to comment on this movie the special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box i don't think i can remember a movie being this bad in a long time and i'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera br br i was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an in house windshield repair but no interior bathroom the zombie movie genre isn't even a factor until the end even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie br br on to the vampires apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is ok by me i'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the why how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flick it all the way through the last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire do you think we did the right thing by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top br br the acting and special effects were at an all time low also you could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the general speaking of the general where did they find this kenny rogers look alike anyways no idea what he was the general of aside of generally confusing and misplaced br br all in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste 3 just my 0 02
<START> when my 14 year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k 911 the third installment in the highly successful k 9 franchise starring everybody's favorite tv dad jim belushi br br folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that it's starting to skip no joke but of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant br br of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesn't measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k 9 movies br br some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment direct to video at that may not seem like something worth watching you'd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie br br i won't give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet one that will have you howling with laughter it's a shame john belushi isn't alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world br br i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party don't forget the puppy chow
<START> be warned this movie is such a mess it's a catastrophe don't waste your time with this one i warned you br br the acting story dialogue music basically everything is so over the top it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous it made me want to throw up if the dialogue acting story wasn't doing it it's everyone being shot crooked you'll feel like you're watching a comedy the problem is the parts that are supposedly funny isn't even funny the acting story cinematography you can feel everything is just trying waaaay too hard but it never succeeds practically every shot is canted but so what this movie just feels like a student film no wonder they shot this in hd because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film br br if you're easily amused or like poor acting writing editing directing full of clichÃ©s everything that's forced in your face oh and did i mention poor acting well actually it's not all the actor's fault it's the director then i guess you'll like this movie br br i had to watch this for a class i would have turned it off right away if i could if you still can't tell by now i hated this movie it made me want to throw up and get my time back at least i didn't have to pay for this garbage br br jeff goldblum you know the guy from jurassic park independence day is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe
<START> a wonderful film version of the best selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of sadie and bessie delany two african american sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of american history ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performances as bessie and sadie respectively amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book etc many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present day ones are very powerful if not quite as inspirational as in the book that is the only real drawback combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly such as the inter racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern but other than that a very well done excellently performed powerful movie
