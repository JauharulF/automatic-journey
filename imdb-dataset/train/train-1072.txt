<START> this movie is horrible but you have to see it because of that i'm not here to discuss the entire film just the greatest chase scene ever when eddie dumbs milk on tim he gets chased down the hallway eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player buy the dvd and watch it slow the best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door but when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics mainly friction yet what lies behind the door is supreme the steepest stair case in any school ever which this jock proceeds to clear in the air in reality he probably would die of a broken neck not only does he defy all concepts of reality he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation go and buy this one trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks
<START> hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood
<START> okay i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get go i reasoned that hell i don't believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this br br however even with that accepted the movie is just not very good it's competently made and acted but it doesn't really capture you at all there are several jump moments and i just looked at them and thought yeah i didn't expect that without actually jumping in the slightest br br also the resolution doesn't make sense if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be then why the hell does it need to use a proxy plus the end caption was absurd they obviously put it there as part of the give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real thing but for that to work it really needs to be at the start but they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb
<START> an excellent example of cowboy noir as it's been called in which unemployed michael nicolas cage loses out on a job because he insists on being honest he's got a bum leg with really nothing else he can do he decides that for once he's going to lie when he walks into a bar and the owner wayne the late great j t walsh mistakes him for a hit man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne lara flynn boyle in fine form michael plays along and accepts waynes' money then he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions and accepts her money to get rid of wayne if that didn't complicate things enough the real hit man lyle from dallas dennis hopper in a perfect role for him shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before br br red rock west gets a lot out of the locations director john dahl who co wrote the script with his brother rick was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation it's an appreciably dark and twist laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt have at least been morally compromised like michael the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing even if the writing isn't particularly logical or credible the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in br br cage does a good job in the lead but his co stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed motivated characters hopper boyle and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies in one especially good twist walsh is also the local sheriff and there's an entertaining cameo role for country western star dwight yoakam who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune br br it's quite a good little film worth checking out it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boring br br 8 10
<START> i have watched this movie three times the last time i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ann's recall of distant events is rather faulty br br take the young ann grant claire danes here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family she must have had help to afford this very expensive education but never seems to have any family ties at all she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect br br ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris arden patrick wilson then when harris comforts lila after the tragic death of her brother buddy ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior i must have missed something significant here ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable ann abandons her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at lila's wedding despite ann's rejection of harris she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed br br it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her a scene showing their chance meeting years after lila's wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann br br the film showed a pattern for ann's romantic relationships she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them this pattern held with harris and two husbands in contrast lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died perhaps lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail br br then came the too convenient reappearance of lila ross at ann's bedside apparently ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from ann's last few lucid moments to identify and contact lila none of this communication appeared on the film br br i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days how did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters br br on another level i enjoyed the film's setting and music immensely the seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful claire danes was luminous as the young ann grant she is really quite a talented singer i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras if only those pesky cgi fireflies would go away i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote
<START> the movie was a long awaited release which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie modesty's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv
<START> the tighter the drama the better the film of sister rivalry this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden so i'm glad to find that wasn't the whole case funny bits on small town bickering are there to enjoy surely but the drama takes center stage as the story progresses and not just family drama it also raises poignant questions on respecting differences of peoples' lifestyle choices br br great character ensemble with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points and they're not just scattershot but hold everything in place it just makes me assume that if ingmar bergman had made this the drama would suit him the international attention probably would have been immediate br br 7 out of 10 from ozjeppe
<START> i claim no matter how hard i seek i'll never find a better movie version of othello if you love kenneth branagh's magnificent masterpieces much ado about nothing 1993 and hamlet 1996 as much as i do i'm dead certain you'll also find oliver parker's othello irresistible laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career he was quite terrific in boys n the hood 1991 i've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement that was of course way before i saw this br br he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant fantastic job irÃ¨ne jacob is absolutely charming desdemona and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked manipulate villain iago marvelous othello is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare's ingenious works it deals with his favorite topics crookedness envy deceitfulness and jealousy this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i've seen that's based on william shakespeare's plays
<START> well there you have it another disillusion on my account two actually first of all even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70's euro exploitation and its most prolific contributors i never heard about joseph w sarno before here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult laden exploitation movies and i haven't seen a single one how why what happened here secondly and even worse just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies that director's most famous and supposed masterpiece turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film admittedly lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality like josÃ© larraz' vampyres or harry kÃ¼mmel's daughters of darkness joseph sarno's film has nothing to offer except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly the events take place in a secluded old castle hidden deep in the german mountains where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty literally baroness her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs which are lit by penis shaped candlesÂauch and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now suddenly don't even ask how the castle is full of young and sexy female guests so even more erotic rites ensue sounds delicious and entertaining enough but the devil's plaything contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a gothic atmosphere or maybe he just didn't bother to and the actresses' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face please do yourself a favor no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian vampire movies of the 70's this one isn't worth a penny even the repertoires of jess franco and jean rollin are pure art compared to this dud
<START> if there was a scale below 1 it would get a 10 following in the footsteps of godspell the acting if there was such a thing was atrocious the plot in shambles and rene russo was sickeningly sweet in her role enough to make a person retch ten thumbs down for a dumb movie saving grace kudos for era costuming
<START> despite a tight narrative johnnie to's election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel election 2 harmony is a virtue but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call it's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander br br simon yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to's direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because tony leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful
<START> the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german post war movies it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet however the makers of this series stuffed it with clichÃ©s it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie which is a direct copy of the cover of 'pearl harbor' br br luise kielberg bettina zimmermann gets to hear that her husband who is a doctor ulrich noethen has died in russia and after the war she's struggling to survive she finds a job at the american base gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer heino ferch in town falls in love with 'm gets pregnant and all of a sudden her husband turns up again come on we've seen this once too often heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince for some reason it always seems she's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes it just didn't work for me br br the action scenes with the planes and the air lift we're sometimes exciting more often not nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot br br unless you're a big fan of wwii movies i suggest you spend your money on something else chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction br br 4 out 10
<START> i wouldn't say this is a bad movie in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the poverty row studios were releasing at the time filmed for monogram bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor scientist masquerading as a respected member of the community in this movie bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides and after their demise injecting bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film however the movie suffers from the ultra wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin coffin nice name for a guy in a horror flick is especially bad in this case i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same stiff wooden and utterly unconvincing miss walters is only slightly better but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable still the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end despite the poor acting by some the corpse vanishes is an enjoyable movie for all to see
<START> there's been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60's greg noll to our current laird hamilton from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws hell i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton one of this generation's great athletes so the rest is just gravy there's loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and unpretentious fashion of all the surfing movies i've seen this tells the big wave story the best and i think it's my favorite enjoy
<START> admirably odd though mean spirited comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome robert altman directed quasi comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight some of the cinematography is evocative shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort's vision of a mother bird imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her in the lead bud cort is once again after harold maude a true original not off putting like say michael j pollard cort manages to be geeky wacky and inoffensive a tough act to pull off unfortunately this is one of altman's misfires he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward from
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture br br justine priestley is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original slants on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amanda's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off br br
<START> was this based on a comic book a video game a drawing by a 3 year old br br there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action nothing we have high tech international terrorists criminals who bicker like pre school kids stallone's man of steel type resilience towards ice cold weather dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious and so on even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb tango tango a film that entertains through some suspense good action sequences and a nice snowy mountainous setting oh yes and the unintentional humour br br the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a swell time then comes a sweat inducing failed rescue part which should make anyone with fear of heights problems want to pull their hair out and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell br br stallone's melodramatic exchange with turner when they meet after a long time is so soapy so clichÃ©d so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self respecting viewer soon after this display of awful dialog writing we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane the entire action is one big absurdity but it's mindless fun at its best although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film after the landing our master criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker they send stallone to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they won't give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off do these gangsters want their money fetched or not very silly apparently they don't trust stallone but surely they know that they can always black mail him by using rooker as a hostage nevertheless our gangsters make stallone's climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are lest there be any doubts and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they overact brag and snicker in a truly evil manner everyone convinced good you'd better be otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal clear to everyone br br the old guy who flies the chopper how the hell did he fall for the trap firstly he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals and secondly he must have heard stallone's and rooker's voices on the walkie talkies a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines get off my back lithgow i haven't even started climbing on your back or lithgow to stallone we had a deal but now we only have each other and as for lithgow's gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately they are very creative about it they philosophize pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on br br stallone co wrote this thing i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i q
<START> this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me the representation of the court of chancery as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent the acting is marvellous from the sinister tulkinghorn to the dedlocks smallweed crooke miss flyte and the two young lovers but it is the spider's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together and the cinematography is superb what mistake did the bbc make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the uk on either video or dvd for many years i tried to find out from them but faced a stone wall in the end i got a dvd copy from canada
<START> this is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark guy kind of like in beauty and the beast it could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks but there are some pretty gross plants instead they make this one girl really itchy so she lets herself get eaten by the shark guy instead of scratching through the whole movie the scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to he even arranges for them to have private time for s e x but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark guy is an ugly icky monster and wants nothing to do with him she gave up on love just because he was a shark i thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he'd turn back to normal and they'd live happily ever after but it's not that kind of movie
<START> in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually smile and say life they shrug and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing definately a must see for everyone
