<START> 1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames attilla the hun wasn't a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english except for the inflections they do not use which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french br br 2 cultural differences can't be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like br br 3 historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part a small town theater group probably has better props br br 4 boring another lame canuck production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci fi show otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes
<START> emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here alan cumming who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and jeremy northam who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching
<START> you must be kidding let's entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress and not just some entry in the quirk of the month club of actors really unless this is meant to be a tongue in cheek satire on david mamet terse confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone think ben stein blandness or a flat out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato award or worse br br as if the stiff and uncomfortable posey weren't enough we've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum there's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory br br adding to this already bizarre casting are several other roles all populated by forgettable actors who look or sound like escapees from america's next top model don pardo or even the kid who pronounces the word been like bean which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's canadian or not i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of alarik jans music for mamet's the house of games if taken as a spoof the film is almost droll if taken seriously just a self conscious piece of drek
<START> in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel ian mcshane his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop meanwhile the deceased joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of london he cheats the reaper and appears to the american student of journalism sondra pransky scarlett johansson who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician sidney waterman woody allen in london and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter lyman hugh jackman sondra drags sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that peter is the killer however she falls in love with him and questions if joe strombel is right in his scoop br br scoop is another great woody allen's comedy outside manhattan actually again in london his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and i laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian however his present muse scarlett johansson of whom i am a big fan has over acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and i was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment my vote is eight br br title brazil scoop Â o grande furo scoop Â the big scoop
<START> a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes but it works the scares are very subtle not the jump cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films the way the scares are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in the uninvited aka 4 inyong shiktak directed by su leon lee but this isn't nearly to the same caliber the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological it's not perfect but it does what it's supposed to do i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance
<START> this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious but it was pretty bad the acting actually was pretty good jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things d bill forsythe well i'm not exactly sure why he was in this film he's way too good for this kinda stuff and his role wasn't exactly demanding i rented this on the strength of those two leads and i wasn't really disappointed i mean heck it's a movie about a half man half shark it ain't shakespeare folks other than the plot which is full of holes and the poor dialogue i would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired there were shots were they were trying to look cool but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line it was pretty bad but if you are a jeffrey combs fan this one is worth checking out he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character forsythe ain't bad either and either is the female lead heck if i can remember her name though bottom line i wouldn't otherwise waste your time
<START> i'll admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel br br i was let down sure the special effects were technically amazing but they weren't believable looking it looked more like a cartoon alright i admit to liking 80 of the chase scene but the fight with all the mr smiths it was too obviously animated br br i can accept all of that what i can't accept is that the non action parts were crap every time morpheus opened his mouth i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing br br i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie except about the existence of the matrix this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream br br ugh i want my 7 00 back
<START> bathebo you big dope br br this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible oooooo the toilet is flushing by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like 1952 i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the drivel br br scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made
<START> the over heated plot of bonjour tristesse is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan which became a best seller though god knows why for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step parent it may have a certain appeal don't be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step mother in prospect unfortunately too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg she's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager the problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger's st joan seberg's first film knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film this movie also by preminger fulfills the promise of the first it was her second movie she was now 20 what was preminger thinking that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg's lack of acting capacity not a chance seberg's character is at the center of the story and pretty though she is convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old she can't meet the emotional demands of the role i don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check in spite of niven and kerr this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons
<START> before nicholas cage was a big action star he was a great actor this lesser known movie is where cage gives one of his best performances red rock west was a low budget almost un known film but is one of my favorite movies of all time i discovered it walking down the video store aisle and wanted to see cage and hopper who also is great in the movie appear together go get this one and i'm sure you won't be disappointed
<START> about halfway through i realized i didn't care about these characters in the least however i watched a bit more anyway regrettably i came back the next day and finished it i shouldn't have bothered br br if you know anything about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it that was almost as bad as snakes on a plane another bad aviation catastrophe flick br br i realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today but even by those standards the acting was embarrassing these weren't characters they were stereotypes i suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by bette davis to help her husband's gary merrill career to no avail however i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did br br davis' playing the happy cripple i e a non glamorous role was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move it wasn't it was just boring she was a kind of tiny tim in the film making trask merrill's character see the truth about love and forgiveness although she was less winsome than tiny tim calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died br br the final scene where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile was so affected and over acted on both ends of the phone line i almost cringed i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film br br i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie if you found it uplifting that's great but frankly i just found it bad there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted
<START> in his directorial debut denzel washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from washington's acting efforts but now we see this touch as a director br br recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection this story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end br br we can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be understated br br if the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty this film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually doesn't transcend from a novel to the screen this of course is a tribute to the director br br this is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too
<START> this is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear i grew up when all my lovin' was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc's power to spellbind any crowd of any age this doco goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the roadies i saw this guy live in aussie 1975 and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago i have a huge 5 1 surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today singer songwriter lead rhythm bass guitar piano ukulele just pure genius there are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand if you want note perfect music buy a studio recorded cd if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd this dvd is for you
<START> rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly un hollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldn't find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me what can i say this may click with you it may not for me it's time i can't get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17 and rosario please you're a better actress pick better scripts
<START> me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so but they let us anyways and i love it i can't find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about i'm glad to see that i'm not the only one that loved this movie i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere i would love to watch this now just bc i loved it so much as a little kid and i'm 15 now i remember so much about it thats where i got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie i think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
<START> the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient box legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth century mexican demon named azar fbi agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters dominique and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon the legend of diablo is an absolute garbage the film lacks scares and gore the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed i'm a big fan of indie horror flicks for example i loved torched live feed bone sickness or neighborhood watch unfortunately the legend of diablo is a huge misfire definitely one to avoid
<START> a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable regardless of the favorable comments here this film is awful badly directed badly edited badly acted badly written you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad br br the muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets and hoodwinks computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identity br br as a side plot ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob newhart that go nowhere while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since nuns on the run a fish called wanda br br the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this even a cameo by cesar romero didn't help it one of the most unfunny poorly paced 'comedies' i've ever seen and certainly the worst caper don't waste your time if you love this you need to see better films
<START> nothing new is this tired serio comedy that wastes the talents of danny glover and whoopi goldberg considering that this was produced by the stars and spike lee it's pretty tame and tired stuff and how come the whoop never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers blah
<START> having never seen the original dirty harry i judged this movie on a clean slate and i must say i quite enjoyed it sure some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish but hey it was the 80's but even if you can't get past her and i almost couldn't or her revenge killings which seemed a little overdone p it's worth it just for dirty harry or at the very least the bull dog he affectionately names 'meathead' p br br 7 10
<START> i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing the darkness of the forest oh the darkness of the dark dark forest or something else so unthreatening the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble y microphone over some synthed up string section and fake drum beats it's horrible br br yes the male leads are awful so are the female ones this is one bad case of gender stereotyping it's so bad everything they say revolves around being a male or a female just playing up the stereotypes to the max makes me sick soooo boring br br the children were so echoey in their lines you couldn't understand them and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair pretty blue dresses and long hair and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair not scary stupid br br daddy's face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave nice beard and bangs pa did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salon br br stupid movie
