<START> 'the last wave' is far more than the sum of its parts it's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama writer director peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'picnic at hanging rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years later br br when lawyer david burton chamberlain is called to defend chris lee gulpilil over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds the everyday and the dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imagined br br no doubt the reason why 'picnic at hanging rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves in 'the last wave' we can piece everything together by the end of the film however even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities br br on the production side weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound the incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the ending br br put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on strongly recommended
<START> i sat through this film and i have to say it only just managed to keep my attention the film would have been a bit more bearable if i did not have to watch the awful cgi for future reference to the industry if your going to use cgi watch this so you know what to avoid br br apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all i saw was a bad movie which bears no resemblance to a graphic novel whatsoever br br all in all the story was not as bad as the cgi i was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but that's not surprising as like i said it only just kept my attention but in all honestly i wish i had given this one a miss
<START> toi le venin is robert hossein's masterpiece and one of the great thrillers of the fifties based on a frederic dard novel a writer the director often worked with see also le monte charge which hossein did not direct but in which he was the lead too the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the fieriest of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale and her sister then begins a cat and mouse play one of the sisters is in a wheelchair but is she really disabled which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night br br the two actresses marina vlady and the late odile versois were sisters br br turn off all the lights before watching highly suspenseful
<START> i don't know if the problem i had with this movie is that i was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but i believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film if you don't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk
<START> outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened br br the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 br br encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does br br davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty br br a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind br br to it to say the least but it was terrible really terrible badly br br acted a witless script cack handed direction watching this film was br br like watching a car crash you want to look away but you keep staring br br because you want to see how messy it's going to get well the car is br br wrecked and there are no survivors on the plus side the cinematography br br was nice made me want to go on holiday if only to cleanse myself from br br this unholy
<START> yes some plots are a bit hard to follow and the bill does have a tendency to get violent but it is actually an engrossing show that i try not to miss a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense and the acting is fairly good though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent i will admit i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8 00 still why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable it is true though that it is more melodramatic than it was but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously 8 10 bethany cox
<START> outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terrible br br nothing about lopez has ever been funny i have watched his stand up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh br br his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body br br i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them br br this guy has a grudge that won't end br br i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves br br the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent br br canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes br br might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay
<START> this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp this wimpy guy morgan jeremy northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies' plans instead morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by lucy liu and pretty much being double crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent how will morgan get himself out of this can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster played by lucy liu and more importantly can morgan make it out alive wow what a nifty movie i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man actively fighting for his life br br the ending wow the ending is incredible the twist is so much fun it left me gasping and cheering like crazy good performances from all around especially from jeremy natham lucy liu and nigel bennett br br i highly recommend this film
<START> what an absolute pile of pants having read chris brookmyre's books religiously since i came across quite ugly i was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned br br i obviously had too much faith br br nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show and even he doesn't quite fit how anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me br br entire characters are changed situations are dropped and to see parlablane's dramatic break in reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window it brought tears to my eyes br br i dread to think what's going to happen with country of the blind if this is the benchmark br br please just avoid it
<START> 24 is the best television show it's an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters and the first episode of all is my best evidence because it's only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns br br jack bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer he can't trust in anybody because people of the ctu may be involved and when this events occurred his daughter kimberly escapes from house to a party but br br at the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more br br it's only the first of the lot and it's excellent
<START> only minor spoilers except as noted br br i've enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro whose superb devil's backbone set in civil war spain was the finest horror film of the last decade it's no surprise then that this film is both well made well acted and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere but it's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see br br what actually is the purpose of all this we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence set more than a decade earlier we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control freakery Âif i can't have you nobody canÂ oddly enough that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree which appears completely different in both motivation and execution what happened to him in jail to cause this change we have no idea though we do later discover as an absurd sort of afterthought that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned br br in britain in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases the terrible question arises what about the wife did she know or suspect what was going on this is a question that this film could have asked and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters but banally the answer to the question is quite clearly no she didn't even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate the film still manages to bungle it all we actually get sketched perfunctorily out at the end is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place where christie's wife says you know what i meanÂ thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror br br major spoiler in this paragraph in the meantime we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again how exactly did he achieve this the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police but how this all works or why or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds remains a mystery br br i actually don't believe serial killers are like this the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff but Â lecter aside Â it gets its serial killers right they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people not the creepily charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie or indeed even man bites dog though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire br br this film has little suspense and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers either generally or in the specific cultural milieu of spain this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women and oddly what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory just one explicit shot properly timed would have been infinitely more shocking and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear very very creepy i'm sorry to be rude i love horror films and can tolerate even the most extreme to the extent even of worrying my partner but i think anyone who finds this film good or interesting even i'd find myself edging away from the purpose of a horror film is to scare you this is just lascivious br br it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed i have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made
<START> four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist who both living in the big apple develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site this in itself is not so unusual but what is is their method of communication foregoing the verbal they take to writing notes and later communicating through video br br the film is based upon the creator's arin crumley susan buice own relationship who besides writing and directing take to acting as the lead characters as well with elements of avant garde anti plot and docudrama the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self indulgence br br as the movie wears on a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality focusing solely on inner conflict or the woes of relationship the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor poignant this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict and a third act to which there is none just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere br br what is even more aggravating is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish this would have been all fine and dandy but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered br br on a side note the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack one of the more interesting aspects of the production br br but as always watch the film and decide for yourself
<START> from the decrepit ranks of the already over saturated 'hillybilly horror' sub genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre there is absolutely new here the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichÃ©s deformed hicks a peaceful family turned gun toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one 'freak' who's good at heart etcetera but does even that half heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time this is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead j d hart once starred in a movie called films that suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed br br my grade d
<START> this movie was hysterical i haven't laughed this hard in a long time i mean it's not good will hunting but was it supposed to be i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant amanda peet is hot and awesome the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did
<START> the animation was fab and the film funny the two circus bugs tuck roll were very funny if you waited till the credits at the end you saw a very funny sequence of film where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable
<START> we bought the dvd set of es war einmal das leben german once upon a time life english for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the es war einmal der mensch german once upon a time man english series us parents had seen it as kids and it has exceeded even high expectations the series is very well made does not show its age and our kids at various ages really like to watch it at the same time they learn things us parents didn't know until way way later the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs all senses blood infection antibodies and much more in animated 20 25 min episodes topics some people may find sensible such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful discreet and child friendly manner the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing while still as typical informative and fun br br children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment the format of the episodes switches between the outside world a family with 2 children and the inside of the body for example in the episode covering infections the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this similarly the episodes on the senses e g hearing seeing link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including briefly where the oxygen comes from plants br br this is one of the best ever children's programs i would say it's a must see for every family with kids
<START> just watched this movie on dvd and thought the acting was very good but the over all story left a lot to be desired this movie has the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle on the underbelly of society in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use crime violence sex and a total lack of self respect for anyone or anything including themselves br br val kilmore is outstanding in his role of burnt out former porn star john holmes the supporting cast is just as good however this is a bleak dark disturbing and depressing film the murder was brutal but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well unless you have an interest in these murders or were a fan of john holmes this really isn't a film to see if you want to see a docu drama on murder truman capote's 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better
<START> i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on zero special effects and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic however i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again
