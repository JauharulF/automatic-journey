<START> this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun which was supposed to be case in point br br 1 in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the ywca after her death the ywca calls her husband at work to give their condolences hello how did they get his work number br br 2 before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the john does this mean the toilet was never flushed br br 3 no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home since she did it behind her rich husbands back br br 4 towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly
<START> well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them br br 'just one of the girls' is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can't keep up the charade for too much longer br br i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn't even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who'd want to watch this if you're looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that haim's career tanked
<START> had this movie been made a few years later i would have given it a lower score however for 1909 this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today just don't try to compare this silent film to later silents the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don't look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond br br this movie is 11 minutes long about average for most films back then and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story the cask of amontillado while many are familiar with the story i won't elaborate further as i don't want to ruin the film just suffice to say that it's very creepy
<START> one of the greatest film i have seen this year last maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the film which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should it br br in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr goines assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus james keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film
<START> there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful the whole chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every filipino etc etc it just isn't believable br br the story is flat out hideous it talked about shin being from a monastery in china later identifying it from bejing however the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on mongolia i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like mongolia for its own granted but its a distinct nation and it even labels mongolia on the map did disney studios fail 5th grade geography br br the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best and yet she somehow feels connected to him her training is just cheesy as well and lets cut to the chase everything about this film is bad its bad enough to laugh at and cry over the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances br br the evil eyes thing was cheesy however the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it they should have left the evil eyes ending in it but instead somehow evil is defeated yey br br overall not worth the time of the dog in the film brenda song should get on with another studio f
<START> ok first of all let me say that i'm still amazed of how the plot sucks br br but than again its a movie that sequels a steven segal movie only with no steven segal omg br br just random low budget action scenes really no point i 'm still amazed i burned 90 min on this crap really br br just rent a jacky chan movie or go see wwf more fun and has no and presume not to have and plot plz plz plz avoid it btw the best actor playing there is bill goldberg and that says a lot br br and no he doesn't play very well like i said plz avoid it pfff i still cant believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this
<START> bo derek's beauty and john derek's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile br br bo looking more gorgeous than ever is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband anthony quinn he has a plan bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life can she find a fitting candidate how will she do him in so tony can do his thing br br with bo's attributes john's unique direction quinn's film presence and thanks to john a very pretty exotic look to the entire film this movie is pleasant viewing
<START> this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal it's about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost it is such a classic the soundtrack is a you've got living legends of metal in it and marc price was great in this film this is a must have for metal fans
<START> i saw this film recently in a film festival it's the romance of an ex alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle aged woman who works in an employment office inem i found the story very simple and full of clichÃ©s taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy the lead actor did a good job he definitely looks like an alcoholic man but ana belen is not believable as a working class woman she looks acts and talks very much like a 'high standing' woman what i mean is that ana belen plays herself she does it in all her movies anyway the whole mise en scene of the film was very poor the photography is ugly not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio the dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times the comic situations are typical from gomez pereira but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly in my opinion this film is not worth watching only if you really love pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit anyway i walked out of the theater because i felt i was wasting my time the film maker was by the door i wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films specially one that is made to please everybody
<START> chris rock apparently desperate for a cozy star vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences updates the hit 1978 comedy heaven can wait with an urban agenda he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body consequently his angels must find another body to place him in and can only come up with that of a white businessman rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as heaven can wait only shows that rock's eye was on the box office this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of hollywood players why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at the apollo terrific supporting cast including the usually reliable regina king the wonderful mark addy wanda sykes eugene levy and terrific frankie faison do what they can but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout 1 2 from
<START> for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance it is done with style and class showing modesty's early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world i think it is a very honest true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o'donnell intended alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool intelligent innocence and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role much more believeable to have a new face creating the part i'm looking forward to the next film
<START> when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it br br we were misled in spades br br on my part i felt billy crystal's character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space br br and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching br br ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that's entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character br br if you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you're looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it's none of the above
<START> thanks to kevin smith a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch and oh no muppets are involved that makes it bad everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it this movie is good fun it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions his aren't correct br br and that ewok song at the end ruled i bet you people don't even enjoy ewoks battle for endor i'm going to set you all on fire
<START> there are people out there who will greenlight anything that is the only explanation i can offer as to why the house of the dead movie exists and that's only scary part to the whole movie it's so bad you'll go off movies forever i seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the tv over to the paint drying channel but i was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing i don't know why i do these bad things to myself br br as if it matters here's the basic jist of the 'story' a group of twenty somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the pacific northwest canada actually because it's cheap for the 'rave of the century' which consists of about 8 people and un raving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry that's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough the fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead hang on i thought this was house of the dead and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda br br first faults here why would a tiny little rave of the century my foot be held on some remote island why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others br br once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 tents a small stage and a port a john has been smashed there's blood everywhere and no one is around what would any rationally thinking person do run for their lives of course but no these clueless obviously blind people decide to go look for them soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again the characters like the movie go nowhere br br jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue heinous acting mumbo jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once popular arcade game of the same name why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers i'll never know the clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further if that is at all possible br br it has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap throwaway line at the end it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory hell even the double dragon movie seems multi oscar worthy in comparison to this junk the only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is jurgen prochnow he could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character the rest of the cast suck i'm afraid the characters are idiots and deserve to die br br plus if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity i see no reason why this film cannot be shown on saturday morning tv it's not frightening in the slightest pirates of the caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film and where did all those bad guys come from anyway there were only a few people on the island to begin with i guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over i kid you not you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times br br who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid none other than director uwe boll his control over the movie is non existent you can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously the actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card it all feels very unnatural br br plus the film is shot like a two part mini series i have indeed seen better tv productions and don't get me started on the editing the film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans no real skill or talent was put into making this at all it truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and george a romero can't even get anyone to take his calls house of the dead makes some idiotic reference to romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post modern' but it only irritates that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie movie br br for what it's worth the 1 85 1 anamorphic picture looks great and the dolby 5 1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over used adr even more the dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself isn't this review warning enough stay away you are all doomed i tell you doomed doomed
<START> based on neil simons play of the same the odd couple tells the story of best friends felix unger jack lemmon and oscar madison walter matthau who end up sharing oscars massive bachelor pad after felix tries to kill himself br br he had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram she calls oscar and lets him know what happened felix turns up at oscar's during his weekly poker game with their friends vinnie john fielder murray the policeman herbert edelman roy david sheiner and speed larry haines after some side splitting hysterics it's agreed felix will stay with oscar br br the rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters as well as looking at if oscar can stand felix's truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if felix can stand oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys highs lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship with great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great monica evans and carole shelley as the british pigeon sisters who oscar invites over for a double date br br this one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and jack and walter are fantastic with a great chemistry also made into a successful and equally funny tv series with jack klugman as oscar and tony randall as felix
<START> i'll try to use words to describe this on br br i saw the original which was good in its own way but back then i should have feared a sequel br br and i was 'afraid' when i picked this one up but now that i've seen it i have to say it's even worse then i thought why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin br br let's start with the actors they aren't all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful but what can an actor do with a script like this one it's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before fails miserably in a futile attempt to get it up to date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big brother' theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad in conclusion if you have nothing and i mean nothing to do go watch it or play frisbee with the dvd by yourself it'll offer you the same amount of fun i promise
<START> i've seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago i must admit it was a really good western which features 2 of the big names on one side there's charlton heston playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade on the other the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the cost br br the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters most of the actors played it out really well especially james coburn who i find that he was really mean in this film but that how it was br br christopher mitchum who i've seen everywhere in other films playing hal brickman i felt his character was left out in the cold but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade to bring down provo's posse's br br all in all it was a great film very good to watch great score from the late jerry goldsmith br br wonderful piece of western persona 8 out of 10
<START> i've seen this movie about 6 times now and each time i view it i'm more impressed by the story and the acting its like watching a train wreck being set in motion its subtle in its approach but very effective in reaching its goal br br spoilers at the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy on the one hand we have deputy major eddy calhoun cusack unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new york's administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss zappati who's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary this situation nicely culminates in the end when zappati orders alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and calhoun ordering pappas to do the same politically speaking br br the movie also contains some really great one liners such as a personal weakness of mine you don't sum up a man's life in one moment the only thing new in this world is the history you don't know br br all in all a great movie that deserves a much higher rating
<START> this movie took my breath away at some points i simply loved it br br i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple short story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon there's nothing more to it br br the overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes it's all just magical br br they've put a lot of love in this movie character designs were great and funny a bit tim burton ish if you like i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story
<START> this movie's heart was in the right place no matter where its brain was br br attack is basically a spoof a la airplane two years before the fact nice going of what happens when vegetables or in this case fruits attack br br through all manner of film magic stop motion papier mache tomatoes on skateboards reverse filming people watching off screen tomatoes people throwing basketball sized tomatoes at the on screen actors the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp br br then it's up to mason dixon miller and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day of course there's a meddling reporter taylor who pops in at the worst times dancing and singing army soldiers japanese scientists with dubbed in voices some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword and oh yeah the san diego chicken before he made it big br br the gags here aren't all that great in fact you could probably make up better yourself after watching these some of the dialogue is inutterably bad please pass the ketchup not something to say in front of tomatoes and as far as puberty love goes well i can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it br br what's good about it well i liked the theme song and the beginning credits and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed that's about it br br three stars not a killer comedy but it tries br br rock on peace
