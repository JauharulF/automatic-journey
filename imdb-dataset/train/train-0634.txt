<START> if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a 1940s hollywood ization of his life making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the film's embellishments can be forgiven br br errol flynn plays gay nineties era boxer james gentleman jim corbett a man who became world boxing champ in 1892 the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on corbett's brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alive br br what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of doubles almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of him he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood br br now as for the real james corbett read on if you aren't afraid of finding out how the movie isn't accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened in reality sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat headed guy they portrayed in the film though it made for a lovely film
<START> i desperately want to give this movie a 10 i really do some movies especially horror movies are so budget that they are good a wise cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy ninja puberty stricken pre thirty year old student non cowboy drawing wise cracking son of a bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year all i can really say is 'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror br br what the hell were they smoking '
<START> don't get me wrong i love david suchet as poirot i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the nile everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i don't think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
<START> i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i fund the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is impressing
<START> budget decent actors who knew these things were important don't waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes br br the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats off br br if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from frogballs community theater
<START> as i watched one of orson welles' last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker i knew i was watching a great movie unfold though at times i did not know why the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film noir average joe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure it is an entertaining ride and it's filled to the brim with welles' unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or don't feel complete in what was welles' full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that br br welles co stars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth as mike o'hara an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people hayworth is mrs bannister married to mr bannister everett sloane who played mr bernstein in citizen kane who is accompanied by a friend mr grisby glenn anders who has great control in his eyes they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o'hara along for the ride and at first he's reluctant but agrees since he's falling for the married mrs as their journey unfolds o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with grisby who at first seems out of his gourd yet as the plot unfolds o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others br br whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty five years though he doesn't have the terrific greg tolland kane's dp at his side dependable charles lawton jr assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works a particular accomplishment is the fun house mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br the lady from shanghai is worth checking out especially for welles hayworth or film noir buffs fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well it may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for touch of evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in
<START> as long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then you'll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs
<START> the people who are praising this film are the real disappointments i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good out of this as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and he's over 70 now but this film is simply terrible at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of leonard's songs it is so bloody precious with its endless close ups of over emoting singers cohen's interview is all done in lo fi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body i couldn't care less about the comments of the performers especially those overblown ego boys edge and bono none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as leonard's own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all heed them this would be an acceptable pbs special maybe for a one time showing but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this when the film finally shows leonard semi performing tower of song it's ruined by bono taking a verse even the occasional good performances antony rufus' first number martha's the traitor are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla forget this one and go buy leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him
<START> i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7 40 i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches they exaggerated the way love works in reality all of the girls were stereo types the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars
<START> just saw the movie and the scary thing was the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors the movie had its moments but also lagged and was rather sick it was all meant to be a farce but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie you think to yourself people like this are all around us all attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another on the plus side there are some great and funny insults i think i would wait for video but it was a good laugh warning jerry takes his shirt off during the movie not a pretty sight
<START> sure i like short cartoons but i didn't like this one naturally kids would love it but then again i'm not a kid anymore although i still consider myself young br br i will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow that's really a shame i wish i lived in the 30's because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guess br br to conclude if you like music and frogs you'll have to see this cartoon otherwise don't spill your time on it
<START> well how was i suppose to know this was the dumb ass promotional lordi motion picture i mean i realized this when that dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming hard rock hallelujah to myself even though i hate that song dark floors is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the people in that particular elevator become momentarily trapped when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around the hospital is empty except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason they run through the hallways and stairwells encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock rock costumes nothing really memorable here except the lousy acting lack of gore nudity and the utterly shameless promotional edge reminding me very much of kiss meet the phantom of the park yeah remember that dud wish i didn't i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band
<START> never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the walt disney studios and great animation creations angela lansbury eglantine price played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world however eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch mr emerlius browne david tomlinson was the person who sold eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the nazi's from evading england great family entertainment and we need more films like this today
<START> cecil b demille's 1922 parlor to prison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a good at heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with her recklessness leads to imprisonment which in turn leads to her regeneration thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia joy but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released it is up to her to rescue him br br if the plot doesn't sound too bad you'll be floored by the woeful presentation the quality of demille's direction is very low and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him the photography is standard and flat and the editing is hardly more dynamic one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes evening gowns golfing costumes motoring costumes piles of furs that it's subtitle could be 'fashions of 1922' br br one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting which is mostly flat and wooden when it is not it is merely routine silent gesturing rolling eye balls twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films is here merely dull to watch the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally she is convincing and endearing in tearful close ups as long as you don't read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak like i said everybody else is droningly routine joy meighan even julia faye her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom br br the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it meighan's character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in it's moral stance and going right back to the decadence of rome insert absurd flashback this movie's moralizing has been described as victorian but it's further than that it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didn't take it any more seriously than modern viewers could br br this movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a 'typical' silent movie with it's archaic moral structure wooden acting and bad direction demille shows that he could be a terrible director with no sense of pacing camera placement or skill in handling either script or actors i can't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously boring slow and idiotic i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only
<START> i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smith's first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasn't but i gave it a go br br what a dead end film being true to life hardly serves you if you're merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that we're already familar with br br i'm sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didn't really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc what's going on hardly plays out as it would in the real world br br would an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on him br br a big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because he's stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one he's a dope he doesn't pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldn't make it past the interview br br i'm looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this is an important film stuff american job doesn't work
<START> i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as i didn't think it was going to be well done the kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so i caved i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought but was still a far cry from the book the movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices
<START> admittedly i didn't have high expectations of corky romano but then again who did however i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt i had no high hopes of joe dirt either another recent comedy starring an snl cast member and i ended up being pleasantly surprised but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor contrary to what you might think after watching this movie with great energy he's been in many hilarious snl skits and i think he's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now in this case he's given a lame pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging throughout each scene he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy not to mention he worked with much better writing kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes he doesn't even wait for the punchline he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack in one scene he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him he comes back to the job strung out on coke now how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on edge when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film br br as for the rest of the cast members vanessa shaw is really hot peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn peter falk is also wasted though he has a few funny lines that i'm pretty sure he improvised i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon that's too much talent too waste on a clunker like corky romano i didn't like falk's last movie made all that much either but at least he had a decent role br br i chuckled a few times but i could not get a single laugh each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery and it's made worse by kattan's hammy acting and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out for example when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one it's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust i can go on and on about what's wrong with this so called comedy but i'm not gonna waste my time like i said earlier if you predicted bad things from the trailers you predicted right br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> family is about two families who are after each other's blood br br viren sahay amitabh bachchan is an underworld don operates from bangkok he has a family in india once by mistake he kills shekhar akshay kumar like viren sahay he also has a family a brother wife and parents aryan aryaman shekhar's brother is out to take revenge of his brother's death he kidnaps viren sahay's family for the same reason br br the film has got one turning point amitabh bachchan second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs expression matters more akshay's minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh i didn't understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie br br there were a few loose points in the script like amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot free in the city kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague how can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover
<START> 52 pick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances ann margret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston who's character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark story that of shakespeare's macbeth and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern yarn br br kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and macbeth's scotland together under one roof the opposing worlds act to br br really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little indies i've seen for it's closure and originality
