<START> a bunch of american students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of ireland in order to study ancient religious practices despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path by the local creepy irish guy natch they do just that and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals the descendants of the infamous sawney bean clan who according to the film's silly plot upped sticks from scotland and settled on the emerald isle br br if you think that porn stars plus low budget horror automatically equals tons of nudity and terrible acting then think again evil breed is bristling with adult stars but in fact there's not nearly as much nudity as one might expect given the 'talent' involved and the acting although far from oscar worthy ain't all that bad with the exception of ginger lynn allen who we know can do marvellous 'french' but whose irish is lousy br br evil breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a couple of amorous campers after some brief under canvas sex the silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in half the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit it's a very gory start and bodes well for the rest of the film br br unfortunately after this promising beginning things start to go seriously downhill we are introduced to the main characters an annoying bunch of twenty somethings just begging to become cannibal chow and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local irish weirdo gary simon peacock and worst of all some sub scream post modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films how clever br br then just as it looks as though the film is never going to get any better director christian viel decides to get serious a guy gets a knife rammed through his head and there's a gratuitous sex in the shower scene featuring lovely blonde gillian leigh not a porn star but i'm sure there's a career there waiting if she wants it after that things improve rapidly as the cannibals kick into top flesh eating gear and the film is transformed into a veritable bloodbath gary has a machete rammed up his ass about time and is strangled with his intestines ginger lynn kick boxes a mutant jenna jameson is torn open eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed on by confused cannibal a guy gets decapitated by cheese wire and taylor hayes is seen bloody bruised and naked with a dead foetus between her legs apparantly she's been captured and used as breeding stock br br all of this is so outrageously gory that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worthwhile and earns evil breed a final rating of 7 10 br br nb a very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in christian viel eventually abandoning the project re shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a us release the good news is that although the film doesn't flow as well as it might have and is cursed with a terrible ending the uk dvd the version i watched seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned only 13s were cut from the film in total
<START> this movie is very underrated it's highly imaginative creative and clever it's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one but the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed bill ted's bogus journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular br br i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late in 1991 bill and ted already seemed so '80s even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap hip hop pearl jam nirvana grunge and the seattle sound bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne van halen and guns n' roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91 and i think that's one big reason the film bombed at the box office nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent and bogus in 1991 gremlins 2 which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s the transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 whereas right now 2002 and last year 2001 still looks looked like 1995 or 1996 br br if only excellent adventure which was made in 1988 was released that year instead of 1989 and bogus journey was made quickly and released in 1989 then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first
<START> i thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th chamber of shaolin but actually it's more of a light hearted sister to the original gordon liu still stars as a would be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky manchus but this time around it's lighter and more comedic the film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new manchurian bosses liu plays chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill but his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them br br the comedy really begins at the monastery where chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted this sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography continuing in the 36th chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and supremely hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons br br also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building chao is not accepted as a student at shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery on the dvd i bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director lau kar leung drew from it this is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in hong kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high rises though the west exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps as a result of his scaffolding work chao develops a special style of kung fu when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu which he first tests during a dust up with the monastery's abbot in the final confrontation with the manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties br br from a comedy perspective i think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre as a kung fu film in general it also stands out i recommend it to anyone
<START> florence chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer of course she swam the english channel both directions she swam from catalina island to the california coast marilyn bell's is a sweet story but the usual glorification of us canadians in the face of a superior world another sample of our inferiority complex our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies that's pretty good better than lebanon what should we do about hockey though and curling the notion of calling this a sport of its inclusion in the olympics ah but we digress
<START> a lot is dated in this episode just like most twilight zone episodes such as the woman's incredibly sexist military uniform and some things are so unbelievable like the easy availability of clean water still consider the year this was made and the time and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch it has a nice sense of hope something missing from a lot of twilight zones as well as an interesting female character despite the fact that she rarely speaks something else rare on the twilight zone two is a great example of how the twilight zone in just over 20 minutes could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today and it's great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers
<START> if you haven't seen zombie bloodbath you haven't a contest like 'make your own horror movie in one day' could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer's intelligence mr sheets forgot a story a plot proper dialog the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up it seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams and copied on even worse equipment make up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people's heads in order to simulate their skin melting this is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad one as well only fun to watch for the friends familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website i have home movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting a total waste of time money and energy the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish
<START> one must admit that dev has an eye for beauty and talent he gave a break to zeenat aman a successful model and also former winner of beauty pageant's title by casting her in a role which was tailor made for her debut her bespectacled stoned look and her swaying at the hypnotizing music made her an instant darling of the viewers this movie is a treat to the eyes with it's scenic locales ethnic people those buddha temples and chirpy naughty mumtaz who looks quite attractive in her ethnic wear and dancing skills dev is of course adorable and this is one of his commercially successful performance hare rama manages to keep the interest going with it's carefully written script editing and captivating music like des pardes his another movie anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction and the theory of them coming from disturbed families and troubled childhood is quite plausible a good entertainer this movie retains it's freshness till date
<START> buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when humanizing animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them br br based on a true story buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each other br br while not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children br br this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the difficulties br br a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions
<START> this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak looks wise in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated well in this film she looks perfect she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy br br i think this film is hilarious especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway one of the funniest scene's in my opinion is judy's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking lol br br one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love br br another point i didn't like was on opening night if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't it just doesn't make sense br br but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect
<START> this movie was extremely boring it should least not more than 15 minutes the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing br br usually i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title br br what more can i say i fall asleep during this movie 3 times it was about 4 hours after i had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period i think it is the point itself br br there is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end br br when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again
<START> what a dreadful movie for some reason scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby dirty mean spirited misanthropes living inside these folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a cgi dragon spoilers an extra nasty scientist whose main acting skill is leering and the sinister stare has cloned a dragon while the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing the other scientists are shocked because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down the rest of the story is like the thing or ten little indians where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and or defeat the dragon the cgi dragon creature is dark gray which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap cgi special effects it hardly looks better than a cartoon and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon all it looks like is a gray blob the acting is less than horrible these scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape hide etc dean cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie he seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast this movie is really really atrocious the acting is bad the story is dumb the cgi is very very cheap and amateurish there is nothing commendable about this movie it is not even a good time killer to glance at while doing chores or other work
<START> i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night after several awful american action adventure films ballistic daredevil cradle of life zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking the story is complete nonsense but i found the film's sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking in one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements in another a princess warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat seeking missile and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent reality br br the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believable br br most strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original good hearted vision of the director br br
<START> i didn't expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under rated movie br br as some have mentioned earlier seek out the two disc set and watch the wadd documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie br br some people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution if you don't want to see it it's easy to avoid it's clearly identified as lapd crime scene footage on the menu
<START> great acting on the part of gretchen mol this film is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in some time while it does cover the majority of bettie's young life it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack there is some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting this film is an excellent break from the dir of american psycho and i think this will show through as her best work to date oh and as a cinematography buff i give this film 100 in the cine dept it was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film stocks accolades to the d o p all around very enjoyable i recommend any interested to see it 8 10
<START> as serials go zorro's fighting legion is one of the best action serials of the 1930s made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast this one has wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters br br in 1824 the president of the newly formed republic of mexico benito juarez carleton young is trying to put his new country on a solid financial footing to that end he has arranged to have rich gold shipments forwarded to the capitol from the local san mendolita mine br br members of the local council plot to steal the shipments on behalf of don del oro a gold armored god who with the aid of the local yaqui tribe hopes to install himself as the ruler of mexico opposing him is don francisco guy d'ennery who forms a legion of locals to aid juarez when don franciso is murdered by don del oro's men a stranger the fopish don diego reed hadley arrives in town diego aka zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends ramon william corson and juan budd buster the token heroine of the piece is ramon's sister volita sheila d'arcy br br both diego and ramon hold seats on the local ruling counsil it soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the council are in league with don del oro first there is the chairman of the council leander de cordova the head of the militia manuel john merton chief justice pablo c montague shaw and gonzolez edmund cobb zorro suspects that one of these men is don del oro but which one br br what follows are several hair raising escapes by zorro and his confederates from the followers of don del oro we have the ever present collapsing rope bridge the deep chasm between two cliffs over which only zorro can jump to safety and the usual assortment of explosions fires and coaches and wagons crashing or going over the cliff hats off here to republic's fine team of stunt men lead by the legendary yakima canutt and the yrigoyens bill and joe canutt performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling beneath the coach which he repeated in other films including john ford's stagecoach the same year br br anyway zorro finally unmasks the false god don del oro and restores peace to the valley before riding off into the sunset in chapter 12 br br others in the cast include jim pierce curley dresden and charlie king as don del oro's hence men and if you look closely you may spot bits by future serial star and lone ranger clayton moore and stuntman canutt in bits big jim pierce by the way may be best remembered for playing tarzan in 1927's tarzan and the golden liom 1927 and for his marriage to joan burroughs the daughter of tarzan creator edgar rice burroughs br br thoroughly enjoyable
<START> demer daves is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and broken arrow remains in everybody's mind as far as melodrama is concerned he should leave that to knowing people like vincente minelli george cukor or the fabulous douglas sirk the screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie natalie wood 's character was inspired by fannie hurst's imitation of life see stahl and sirk but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway susan kohner was more credible in imitation of life and sinatra and curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them the poor officer and the wealthy good looking and mean sergeant guess whom will natalie fall in love with france is shown as a land of tolerance where interracial unions are warmly welcome at the time circa 1944 it was dubious it still is for narrow minded people you can find here there and everywhere
<START> the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10 of the movie's appeal the other 90 can be attributed to it's flagrant bad ness to say that sean young's performance as a so called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement with her bland suits and superfluous hair gel young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie watching young go from frigid to full frontal nudity does little to raise interest but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does watching her rant and rave about her self loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee but it's all downhill to and from there despite her urge to bring patrick bergin's character to justice her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this but i can't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess i'm guessing it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic
<START> in canadian director kari skogland's film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen burstyn is hagar shipley a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well meaning son marvin filmed in manitoba canada and set in the fictional town of manawaka the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century br br the title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on hagar's mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for hagar's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego driven self defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father her well meaning but alcoholic husband and both of her sons as she nears the end of her days she reflects that pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear i was alone never anything else and never free for i carried my chains within me and they spread out from me and shackled all i touched br br confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice over narration the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl chaperoned by her aunt dolly she meets her future husband the previously married bram shipley cole wings hauser a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the native american population the young hagar is played by christine horne who is exceptional in her first feature role despite hagar's pleading her relationship with bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka condemning the young couple to a life of poverty br br going through the motions of her marriage to bram hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes when she produces two sons marvin dylan baker and john kevin zegers she is unable to give them the love that they need every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning she reflects all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearancesÂwhen did i ever speak the heart's truth like the biblical hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride hagar leaves manawaka to live in ontario but eventually returns to the shipley farm br br as the scene shifts back to the present hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by marvin and his wife doris sheila mccarthy here she meets a young man named leo luke kirby who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story's outcome although the spirited performance by ellen page as john's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half
<START> the blob qualifies as a cult sci fi film not only because it launched 27 year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s interestingly nobody in the kay linaker theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous scarlet red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as the blob steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall the old west bounty hunter in wanted dead or alive after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures' release meanwhile mcqueen's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in the andy griffith show as sheriff taylor's school teacher girlfriend helen crump of course neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers director irvin s yeaworth jr made his directorial debut with the blob linaker simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres first the alien invasion second teenage delinquency third a murder mystery and fourth a horror chiller moreover while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes it remains largely anonymous in other words the eponymous jell o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy instead it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody the tone of the blob is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature br br as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of the blob the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing jane anita corsaut and steve steve mcqueen see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it meanwhile an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick when the old timer olin howland of the paleface gets a closer look at it the goop attaches itself to his hand the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr hallen in town br br hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation of course hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve's fast driving steve fools him into a reverse drive race but the local police chief dave earl rowe lets him off the hook steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor after they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr hallen's office during the interim the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer killed hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident dave is frankly incredulous while sergeant bert john benson believes that it is a prank bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car br br steve and jane take them to hallen's office but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody but dave admits that the office has been vandalized against sgt bert's advice dave turns the teens over to their respective parents no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again they drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket when they go to retrieve the mutt steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens they find nobody inside but they encounter the blob steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them later after they escape steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store about that time the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers suddenly a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off br br the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark producer james b harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo br br the blob proved to be a drive in hit and steve mcqueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum unless you are a juvenile this little horror movie isn't scary at all but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination so the blob isn't without a modicum of subtlety
<START> i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception it may have been a brilliant horror thriller movie br br beginning on halloween night 1968 6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again br br from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael the murderer is exactly the same throughout the movie thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow br br for the horror thriller enthusiast there is a severe lack of blood gore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age a happier medium could have been found br br from a half hour into the movie not one scene is unexpected the acting for a horror thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast br br a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere a second positive would be the character of michael's doctor who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead br br however it is clear that the star in jamie lee curtis is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim br br it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day but from other horror thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s it falls far short of a truly great horror thriller film br br i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s cheers
