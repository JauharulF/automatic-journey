<START> lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the writer directer was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless i understand that the plot was supposed to be non climactic and stale that was what the writer director was going for a very very very dry humor comedy with all that understanding i still think the movie sucked it seemed like the writer director was trying to recreate napolean dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character behaved similar to napolean but napolean dynamite was actually funny its script worked this movie is not it has no purpose well let me rephrase that its only purpose is to rip off napolean dynamite and try to capture that look and feel too bad it didn't work
<START> as an anti football person i on the surface grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii the trailers looked fun so i thought i'd give it a go br br it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen and that wasn't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium the acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy i've seen in a long time dare i say it better than east is east br br this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged though not a characteristically twisting and turning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect br br saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script fillers i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy endings you could be either delighted let down by the ending personally if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers br br as for the actors i would have to say that juliet stevenson paula put in the finest performance i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to kiera knightley jules but don't get me wrong even she offered a great performance it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera this time you're it br br tip don't leave before the credits once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldn't have watched this film after all my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice oh what am i saying it was absolutely brill and i can't recommend it enough i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos i'm a student i only splash out if it's really worth it
<START> first let me just comment on what i liked about the movie the special effects were fantastic and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game there that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing br br i have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where lois's 5 year old son turns out to be the super powered child of superman when the crying super child throws a piano at lex's henchman to save his mother i almost got up and left the theater singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super powered illegitimate child it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit br br my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman related projects ever again the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas that's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground br br my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god like jor el sent to earth to be a savior jor el wasn't all wise he was just a scientist and he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode i'll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ's primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i'm too brain dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman returns the passion of the christ br br and speaking of luthor my last major complaint has to do with singer's depiction of lex luthor lex luthor is a shrewd cold hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world the man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman returns as well as all the previous superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer's next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show zam whap pow br br to summarize i don't know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already don't see it don't buy it when it comes out on dvd don't rent it basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way this movie does not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that sees this movie bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars if you're a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time
<START> this movie was terrible i rented it not knowing what to expect i watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb the acting was bad and there was no plot the monster is soooooo fake it growls and its mouth doesnt move also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster just plain bad don't even waste your time 1 out of 10
<START> in celebration of earth day disney has released the film earth stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves br br the stars of the show are a herd of elephants a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed br br global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years we never see the bears catch any seals but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution br br the aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots i ever saw it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen br br one of the disappointments i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals their incredible speed the idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i think began with or at least it's the first i recall seeing the television show kung fu during the early seventies br br an interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed there are enough dramatic humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs perhaps because of some selective editing sparing us as it were from the grisly end of a prey predator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right and you can take your kids br br three stars
<START> watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work i had a really hard time accepting this not that i don't think tom can't act he can i've been following his career since mazes and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me maybe because i'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach the movie as a whole fails for me the additions jude law and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score but tom as the angel of death sullivan was completely flat
<START> the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy seen in that light it does deliver br br if you're looking for a serious movie look somewhere else this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of issues with no insight whatsoever br br making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable stereotypical ways br br busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable and michael rappaport turns in a good performance but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite it's hard to find anything redeeming
<START> this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like most movies show jesus as being effeminate lobotomized or tortured this jesus laughed played and was serious when it was necessary this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to not the usually hollywood version br br the movie took some liberties attempting to fill in the blanks but the fillers didn't seem impossible or even improbable one thing i might argue was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus' death not that the jewish authorities were against the idea br br it seemed that the movie was researched well one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called mark it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 51 i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible
<START> this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent full of clichÃ©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker br br if i could give this movie a zero i would too bad imdb doesn't allow that br br the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed take my word don't waste your 8 on this piece of trash the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name in all highly not recommended
<START> kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth watching br br i say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie br br first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weak willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later that said kevin kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass
<START> it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the czechs obsession with 'the professionals' but if not 'jedna ruka netlaska' is yet another great czech film it is funny dark and extremely enjoyable the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing br br for a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature from hrabal hasek and kundera to the films of menzel sverak and numerous others czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it this film is just that it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise good intent and optimism br br i highly recommend this and most other projects trojan and machacek are involved in enjoy it it's a film made for just that reason anyway it's as close as the czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending
<START> as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie i was immediately excited the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn't wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies however when i saw it i left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other movie goers at the theater with me while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them in the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more and much unfortunate preachy point of view to sum up the plot there wasn't much to it that wasn't expected the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it that's not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous unless you're a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply won't care it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity agent smith for as bad ass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy personally i don't need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it the movie was a serious waste of my time and i don't think i can watch the first one anymore the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off what movie ends with to be concluded how original is that folks i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one in conclusion the movie was bad and that's the end of it
<START> ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money the producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg 13 how many pg 13 slashers movies have turned out to be good thats like asking how many women have been on the moon the answer is none prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that br br my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him br br 1 the way he escapes he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent what the hell why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something 2 his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her so does he want to kill her love her or just plain rape her 3 the killer is too good how did he develop all of his skills he used to be a teacher so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't notice it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible silly stupid attempt at a horror movie
<START> this was one of those 50 cent deals of yore and far more complex than most realize and it was in color not only are the effects extraordinary vs crap like 'earth vs the flying saucers' the real 'killer' is the 'universality of plot' everything hinges on two principles the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous thinking father's desire for his daughter and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all citizen's desires become manifest br br needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead not many if any left and that became the fate of the 'forbidden' planet's populace rather modern actually unfortunately the 'gear' of 'the krell' wasted by ignorance remains and 'morpheus' the incestuous father knows how to access such tech and does so to prevent losing his daughter to another ancient plot beautifully rendered br br and considering its age it remains a stunning suspense action human emotion classic and visually very modern don't pass this one up it presages all modern sci fi and its pscychological content elevates it beyond any genre a timeless work br br and the soundtract you will see hear no pure 'synth' and perfectly syched moog background a 'not miss'
<START> i really enjoyed this movie britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you holly fulfills her dreams just like britney br br there are times in everyones' lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens br br i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams she will never know how much that means to me bravo britney you are the greatest
<START> there are often badly matched couples in the general sense of the term in huston's movies african queen heaven knows mister allison roots of heaven misfits the barbarian and the geisha check the title is another good example so to speak it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as sayonara the world of suzie wong and the teahouse of the august moon bear witness huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot with the exception of susie maybe john wayne perfectly fits in ford's world in huston's he's like a bull in a china shop his japanese partner is totally bland even the dramatic scenes cholera epidemic do not save the movie from absolute boredom br br only those utterly enamoured of huston's every work need to choose this among all his other great movies around
<START> this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx and i bet it will be my last i failed to see why he was funny although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera or for saying i am going to take a shower br br the plot is completely predictable the bad guy comes after the good guy the good guy has a woman so the bad guy uses her in between the officials screwing up the final scenes are utterly unbelievable you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle br br there's no great acting there isn't much of a plot or storyline and the shooting is done mtv style don't waste your money on this one br br
<START> gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india 'gandhi my father' is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into gandhi's personal life br br overall i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna and shefali shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers commendable job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings br br however what i didn't quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone over dramatized br br overall good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as must watch once 8 10
<START> lensman is a rather lesser known anime gem from toho and mk studios it's loosely based on the novel but it reminds me more of the game metroid br br if you want to see this see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain japanese the english dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death br br there is not much new despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature to combine cg graphics with hand drawn animation but it's fun to watch nevertheless
<START> i don't doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable charles laughton and franchot tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn't have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn't no split involved in his award br br the movie and the story by liam o'flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in he's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in wants enough for passage to america there's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip br br the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they're pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek he also picks up a hanger on played by j m kerrigan br br the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to br br john ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it anglicized was sean o'fiernan br br preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril br br the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court meek ain't in a position to say no the king's justice and writ does not run here it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the british are indeed losing their grip on the population br br of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing br br the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time
