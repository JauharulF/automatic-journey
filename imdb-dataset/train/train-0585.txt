<START> an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease it was hard to tell the man was even acting maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice narrator of city confidential winfield ends his career with a so so movie but as always winfield shines a treat to watch br br erika eliniak is well erika eliniak nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department though to be fair this is one of her better efforts br br bottom line a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul winfield fan a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven what an actor he will be missed
<START> my god what an incredible movie it is reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibson's movie we were soldiers when the company is not lost they're just cut off and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck if all americans are like you then god help the nation that goes to war with america br br put all 3 movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desert br br the story of the cut off battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it there were audible groans in the cinema during the above mentioned scene in pearl harbour no kidding either the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own Â br br americans think they are unbeatableÂinspired braveryÂ i actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster the movie that is br br the fighting scenes were well made 3 stars for that but if the script is manure then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons it is still manure the writer james carabatsos also wrote those other screamersÂhamburger hill no mercy heartbreak ridge someone please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage br br the director russell mulcahy is an australian too god the shame
<START> secret sunshine reminded me of the rapture 1991 with mimi rogers and david duchovny but this korean production is a better film it portrays super religious korean christians in a provincial korean city and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy shin ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of milyang 'secret sunshine' in chinese from seoul with her young son she has chosen milyang because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place she does not react well to the overtures of the local christian zealots one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings shin ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can in fact she brushes just about everyone in milyang off to begin with but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world and the consequences are often hilarious to say more would be to give the film away but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role jeon do yeon is stupendous having read that she won the best actress award at cannes in 2007 i expected her to a decent job but ms jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen the movie is a sort of harrowing evelyn waugh esquire piece of work showing how fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable
<START> spoilers br br first off nothing really happened in this movie other than a woman bleeding inexplicably second it wasn't scary third it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever let me elaborate the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead Â i'm not sure which so let's just go with beavis the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter forcing you to turn up the volume i watched this at home then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary shocking images forcing you to quickly lower the volume again this occurs many times until mercifully the movie ends i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep this one is a big mistake but then it's a big mistake anyway here's a thought Â if you're going to make a horror movie at least add a gratuitous beheading a 19 year old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil a la tv's lost in space these people didn't even try to scare me they just wanted to hurt my ears
<START> nada was the most inadequate follow up to les noces rouges which with hindsight appears now as the last good movie of chabrol's golden era 1967 1973 nada is chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie its previous work les noces rouges had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces nada includes terrorists ambassador hostage taking a lot of blood not really chabrol's field a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grÃ¢ce only duchaussoy who had already played with the director and maurice garrel are up to scratch viviane romance one of duvivier's actresses la belle equipe panique is wasted as a madam gabrielle italian actors fabio testi lou castel are awful br br with nada this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol it would be violette noziÃ¨res before he was again at the top of his game
<START> the alternate title of ecstasy is symphony of love a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film ecstasy is an early talkie and could have very well been a classic film if released during the silent film era this film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality which is presented in an artistic low key fashion the director's style is distinctly european the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in hollywood at that time consider the censorship code in the us during the 30's that pretty much sums it up hedy lamarr one of the great beauties of all time was a perfect choice for this 'symphony of love '
<START> from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst the music i noted that the film has two composers listed this must be the reason why every single frame has music of the absolute worst d movie style drivel they have never heard of the expression less is more it got so painful to listen to i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue not that the dialogue was that good you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers see it at your own risk
<START> in mexico city the former cia assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man john creasy denzel washington is hired by the industrialist samuel ramos marc anthony with the recommendation of his old friend rayburn christopher walken to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita dakota fanning and his wife lisa radha mitchell pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy making him live and smile again and he feels a great affection for her when the girl is kidnapped and creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction br br man on fire is almost a masterpiece and will become certainly a classic in the future the story is excellent never corny and although having 146 minutes running time the viewer does not feel time passing the cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses their performances are outstanding highlighting denzel washington dakota fanning and radha mitchell the cinematography has wonderful moments and the screenplay has stunning lines i personally loved when the character of christopher walken explains to manzano giancarlo giannini that creasey's specialty is death and he is preparing his masterpiece i agree with the user that commented that man on fire is one of the best if not the best film of the year in this genre my vote is ten br br title brazil chamas da vinganÃ§a flames of the revenge
<START> next to star wars and the wizard of oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made it's a true shame it's not as well known as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci fi settings and that it's british meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation br br like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film i'm currently 18 but one must appreciate classic films first i absolutely adore this film it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any john williams star wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won oscars and state of the art oscar winning special effects for the time and some are still stunning and of course june duprez's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta jones' she even looks like jones in a way br br in conclusion this is one of my all time favorite movie next to the adventures of robin hood and it truly deserves more attention it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout and along with robin hood it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed br br stars excellent
<START> this film is awful give me the dentist anytime can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting better plot more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid don't even watch it if you're drunk
<START> boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough karloff usually is the better man of the two the real exception is the black cat 1934 where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life but more usual is black friday where whatever his motive karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug in the raven lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough rarely are they both negative characters totally in the body snatcher karloff does kill lugosi but lugosi is trying to blackmail him br br the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned in it karloff's dr janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens walter kingsford and beulah bondi and has another scientist a frenchman named dr felix benet lugosi rukh's young wife diane frances drake and a friend and protÃ©gÃ©e of the stevenses named ronald drake frank lawton br br before they leave rukh is warned by his mother violet kemble cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy he tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due credit br br what he gets is a disaster he finds the substance but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity he finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die he's actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger but there are two things that are unbeatable here the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be replenished and the radioactivity has affected rukh's brain he is increasingly jealous of diane's friendship with ronald encouraged unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died the effects of the radioactivity are like that benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that radium x is giving to man soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his own br br the film certainly picked up on science to an extent madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging howard carter and lord carnaevon br br on the other hand benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england during the whitechapel murders sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes but the idea did not die jules verne used it in his novel the brothers kip in 1899 and here dr benet uses it as this is a science fiction story he finds the image of rukh on the the plate but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters br br the film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films the other performances are good as well in particular ms kemble cooper she is best remembered as basil rathbone's frightening sister jane murdstone in david copperfield here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target
<START> i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie in 'a guy thing' jason lee plays paul a straight laced seattle based fellow who is about to marry his fiancÃ©e karen selma blair and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle class domesticity we first meet paul at his bachelor party where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case he's a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife of course the next thing paul knows it's the morning after the night before he's in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother in law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over oh and the hula dancer is karen's cousin becky julia stiles br br from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful family oriented good guy who's super excited about his forthcoming nuptials his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun loving becky forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch
<START> in the year 1990 the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime shows like chip n dale rescue rangers ducktales and gummi bears was already popular and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon that cartoon is called talespin it's about old jungle book character baloo the bear as he gets a job in the plane business in the series he meets kit cloudkicker former air pirate and good cloud surfer business lady rebecca cunningham and her hyperactive daughter molly this series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection parents buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible nickelodeon cartoons if you liked talespin then check out darkwing duck and goof troop spin it
<START> sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next thus sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation harry's always on the job it seems clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action slow deliberate and without fear as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less bottom line brimming with intensity and action sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series
<START> after mob boss vic moretti late great anthony franciosa kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek their new chauffeur vietnam vet and blames it on the poor guy derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden vic's prisoner brother who runs the jail and oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady cia agent great genre mainstay and first time director john saxon to turn various prisoners into super human invincible zombies of course things get out of hand and it's up to derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over br br john saxon is a great talented actor as a director saxon is a great talented actor to say this movie john's sole directorial outing to date lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement however the film isn't totally without merit the dialog while idiotic is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes sadly this isn't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it's own which is fairly late in the movie as such the most i can recommend this film is to say that if you're a fan of saxon which i indeed am it's worth one watch just go in with low expectations and you should be fine br br eye candy dana lis mason and tane mcclure get topless br br my grade d
<START> this is a pretty strange movie it does comes across as an exploitation film with over the top violence and unrealistic situations but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other as opposed to an invading 'other' br br the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths kris kristofferson's last line is 'i ain't lost a war yet' as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction including the town's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene however kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth vincent is clearly the golden boy but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him br br the movie has b movie grade action though the presence of kristofferson vincent a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peters give it an a grade lineup br br i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post vietnam pre reagan introspection paranoia and confusion and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time br br seen on the this channel a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s regardless of political bent
<START> i watched written on the wind starring rock hudson lauren becall robert stack dorothy malone robert stack was terrible just bloody horrible he was supposed to be a charming jet setting millionaire instead he came off like a jerk from the word go the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 romantic leads had no chemistry somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress although her campy tramp character was boring think the older sister from splendour in the grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma director douglas sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on get smart
<START> though the plot elements to the eighth day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that jaco van dormal's first film had though not as good as toto the hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions daniel auteil from 2001's flavorless the closet downplays his part afraid to overact rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic however i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth br br don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from toto the hero because you will be disappointed however the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie
<START> this documentary has been aired on both rte and bbc in the last number of months having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making br br initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of venezuelan president hugo chavez the irish crew set off with those intentions what happens when they get to venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions particularly the oil concerns in venezuela of chavez and his government what we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens br br it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers br br
<START> this film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers the main point of the book the insights are hardly even touched upon leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives br br the character development is not good at all no background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them and so the action sequences fall flat br br the search for the manuscripts ends abruptly and with no real explanation not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for br br this is one of the worst adaptations of a book i have ever seen it is horrible and a waste of time if you have not read the book skip the movie and read it if you have read the book skip the movie and reread it br br it is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is it is a shame too because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors br br please don't waste your time read the book
