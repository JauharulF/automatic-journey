<START> first off the movie was not true to facts at all i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it in my opinion russell crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent individualist type therefore he really couldn't play one it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics similar to pi and not the over dramatized lovelife at this level abm was too hollywood ish and too superficial to be great personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we lesser mortals 5 10
<START> i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr br br what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed's we get insight into ed's personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making br br the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background br br fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story br br ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement br br even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood's legend br br in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling
<START> i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny if you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 if it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100 br br
<START> gabe ryan frankie thomas gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums his sister ann sheridan does her best to keep him out of trouble but it just seems to follow him aside from his associations with the termite gang gabe is followed by real life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance they need someone to blame for the arson and gabe is it it is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts br br the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good the boys wander on over to the new resident's furniture on the street and proceed to make it their own they talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together bernard punsley takes a nap in a chair the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy but after he proves himself a good fighter they ask him to join their club br br the initiation scene is rather good too filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first but is really rather clever and innocent br br later when billy halop studies to become the boy mayor he has a dream about schoolwork this is wonderfully staged with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him br br angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces and really tells what the kids are doing notorious for bad behavior on and off the set these boys make nice in this film but rather than seem disingenuous it makes for some great laughs this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the bowery boys series we even get a few garbled words from leo gorcey
<START> a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top and it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line 1 star don't even bother
<START> this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen however this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid if you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved they've all seen better days but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film i can't go on enough about this horrible movie its almost something that ed wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece br br to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen heard this thing has got to be five minutes long on top of that it is narrated as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read then we meet mr slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line soon we meet stephen dorff who i typically enjoy and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does then comes the ultimate insult tara reid playing an intelligent role oh help us tara reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the american pie type br br all in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video i know that i got a kick out of it i mean lets all be honest here sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others
<START> an excellent documentry i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties that time is gone forever this is a good pre homo thug movie when queens were really proud to be extroverts goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film
<START> this film is moving without being sentimental meaningful without being pretentious it tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the encroachments of technology and an advancing society make the family run business increasingly untenable br br the acting is wonderful though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors we should have long ago they play their characters with honesty and reverence these are flawed characters each with major weaknesses but with such utter humanity and kindness that it's impossible not to become engaged in the story br br we need more films like this we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this
<START> gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes br br i love 50 sci fi i even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mst3k kinda way br br virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of abott costello br br chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it can't in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature br br that said i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
<START> without a doubt private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen a japanese import poorly translated into english its a joy to watch not much of it makes sense but that doesn't matter it's the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny br br the film is rare and unavailable on video but i have caught it a couple of time late late at night on pay cable my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly person by person introduce this film gem to the world br br joanna pacula plays the tutor lover to ken our hero she apparently was just working for her check ken is played by goro inagaki of the japanese pop band smap who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie stacy edwards of in the company of men fame shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards br br it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house at least 50 or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie's finale br br the movie is predictable but highly quotable my friends and i reenact entire scenes yes it sounds like we're lame losers and we are but we're lame losers who have seen private lessons ii be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie you'll thank me for it
<START> i'd always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business and finally he did and he made me proud this movie lived up to what i had hoped for duchovney played his character very well managing to remain consistent with something new instead of playing the agent molder we are used to therefore i give him extra credit for his role also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character david was great but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton a brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie because he never fails to surprise you he has weaknesses and strengths making the story all the more believable i also very much enjoyed the narration it added to the story a good deal and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time this movie also had a wounderfull score i recomend this for anyone who likes drama and doesn't mind blood
<START> cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews as if it were a mediocre movie of some run of the mill dudes br br the movie is great funny crazy over the top violent though with minimum gore and all the way energetic to the core loved every single bit of it can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off and now the most important thing at least to me it is computer effects free when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high resolution and damn high budgeted action fuflo a russian word that means bull beep i understand that any beep child can do it you can adjust the wires to the body add some cute pc effects and stuff it into the action film here it is different i don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the chinese football play and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun not pretending to be star wars br br having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie it does not spoil the atmosphere to me br br can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play some of you suppose won't like it as to me it's amazing have a look at the dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth it's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces br br this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype br br total 10 out of 10 a legendary movie in its genre thank you for attention
<START> ouch this one was a bit painful to sit through it has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances alan bates and jennifer tilly among others played it way over the top i know that's the way the parts were written and it's hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock if you're going to have outrageous characters that's ok but you gotta have good material to make it work it didn't here run away screaming from this movie if at all possible
<START> in 2054 paris avalon a computer generated system controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped detective karas craig must go against avalon to find her br br renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many br br pixar are the animation masters their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though and like 2007's persepolis brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation br br in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making br br volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy and is finely directed also br br for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapi br br renaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot br br the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements there are many things wrong with the scripting not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages
<START> to make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism 1 we are never told why these people believe this 2 location is new years eve in toronto canada so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight why based on the costumes did it seem like september br br 3 the acting was in that neo au natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it br br 4 the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the film br br rating 1 2 out of 4 2 on imdb scale br br thank you i am as always br br jay harris aka sirbossman
<START> yes this production is long good news for bronte fans and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other versions br br timothy dalton is edward rochester it's that simple i don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome dalton is attractive certainly but no pretty boy in fact he possesses a craggy angular dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very masculine mr r and he takes on rochester's sad tortured persona so poignantly he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it but also displays rochester's tender passionate emotional side as well imo the newer a e production suffers in that ciaran hinds whom i normally adore seems to bluster and bully his way throughout i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast br br when i reread the novel i always see zelah clarke as jane ms clarke to me resembles jane as she describes herself and is described by others small childlike fairy though it's true the actress doesn't look 18 she portrays jane's attributes so well while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen who was the picture of demure submission although her true nature was dissimilar jane learned to master her temper and appear docile in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service' jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr rochester she would certainly not speak to him as an equal even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer nevertheless if you read the book to which this production stays amazingly close you can clearly see the small struggles zelah as jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even tempered br br the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right i think no it does not in the least resemble hollywood thank god it's not a hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal and for a woman like jane who never presumed to have any love come her way it is a minor miracle br br the rest of the casting is terrific and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here so too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general features more humor than other versions i've seen in particular the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful br br jane eyre was in many ways one of the first novelized feminists she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently and at last as rochester's true equal just beautiful
<START> i remember when i first saw this movie i was in sixth grade when it happened before i saw this i had listened to the original broadway recording of it and i really loved it but when i saw this i was like what the heck this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud who decided to do all of that br br i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful highlands of scotland and who the heck decided to cut all of meg's songs out of the movie br br i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie lerner and lowe were probably wondering who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece well they had a right to say that if they did they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie br br song and acting wise mr kelly you passed the audition with flying colors but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text br br so in short if you want a good movie based on a musical by frederick lowe and alan jay lerner this one isn't it br br 3 10
<START> not exactly my genre this straight to dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers i'm relatively open minded and quite a fan of eamonn walker so i sat back ready to enjoy myself br br blood and bone is the story of isiah bone an ex con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses blah blah blah br br what a tedious film i understand that films like this don't rely hugely on plot but do they have to stuff in such a silly predictable and entirely stupid storyline it may not be important but by golly gum does it annoy me better no plot and pure action than a clÃ­che ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards i should probably at this point mention what is of course the film's drawing point the fighting even in itself the fighting is rather poor bone manages to take out well established tough man street fighters in single punches a large oaf or two is the filmmakers' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy even this is repetitive and stupid arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again br br a run of the mill film by numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again and not even particularly well
<START> i suppose many people comment review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible i'm writing due to the latter br br i was excited for the sequel to wargames i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content i felt it was worth watching more than once this being 2008 i had high hopes for what they would do with this film computers gaming terror military over zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film and wargames the dead code had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick br br the movie failed on pretty much every level but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects the dead code was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms meanwhile will farmer is button mashing about 7 000 commands none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen until finally he wins by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20 000 virtual people nobody is near the gas because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes this tells ripley the real life war machine that he is a high level terror threat br br even though any 5 16 year old could complete this same task the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity they say things like he has expert knowledge of bio terror he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio terror so then a movie long chase scene with about 01 of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter sometimes they are mad they barely miss him but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him br br ugh i would write more but i already wasted 1 5 hours watching this i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic tac toe for 1 5 hours
<START> as someone else commented this is a feel good movie it's got glorious scenery and the wonder filled voice of luciano i've seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon i'd forgotten how much i miss pavarotti's singing of nessun dorma and i need to get out the cd it's a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie eddie albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top but all agents are just that anyway the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view if you need acting of olivier proportion this movie isn't for you if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music watch this film just enjoy
