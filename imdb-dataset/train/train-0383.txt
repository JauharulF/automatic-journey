<START> certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix river's sister inevitably as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbins the author of the novel which had retains its peculiar sweet loopy charms
<START> actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part and it's much worse than other mj movies like the wiz captain eo and ghosts but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years yeah that's half my life you guys i can't complain too much about it just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me but as a movie it's not good at all and i'm afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it but since no one but mike is the moonwalker it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me
<START> goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact it's just the old odd couple buddy formula aren't any new stories being written br br as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london's citizens file politely into air raid shelters even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br i found goodnight mister tom' cliched and obvious and john thaw's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin' accent br br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one br br
<START> saw in on tv late last night yeah i can hear what y'all say about this one it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo typical tv soap series in all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying well that's not what i expected but as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no there's nothing to congratulate rated r oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again
<START> i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class
<START> on second viewing of this movie i like it even more than the first time it is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences the meeting of a tow truck driver and client the jogger hearing a baby's cry from the bushes the dialogue acting casting and direction are superb no two by fours no grand revelations what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated kudos to all involved in this we need more grand canyons in our lives 9 out of 10
<START> although i've long been a fan of peter weir i hadn't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave and it was a pleasant unpredictable surprise br br richard chamberlain plays david a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine for david's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence but david believes there's a mystery underneath the murder linked to tribal rituals as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too br br to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting br br there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie chamberlain's acting for instance but also the performances by david gulpilil who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries and nandjiwarra amagula who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie br br but there's also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie david has dreams that warn him of the future australia is undergoing awful weather with storms hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution but it's also related to the case david is defending how it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression suggesting future horrors without really showing anything br br charles wain's score is fantastic especially the use of the didgeridoo the photography is also quite good russell boyd weir's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander depicts a dark creepy world full of mystery br br i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions like dances with wolves or the last samurai this movie is too clever to be that simplistic br br sometimes it can be frustrating and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity the last wave is a great movie to watch
<START> after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre pubescent teenagers today's well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it's own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywood's record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest br br the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i haven't read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprised this movie isn't even based on that story at all br br the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i won't point them out i won't spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimov's characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical i e unthinking who will state the movie doesn't have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and don't buy the rights to the works title it something else don't use the character's names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show br br i robot like much of hollywood's take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this
<START> this movie started out with some semblance of a plot then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward it was impossible to remain engaged with this film this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation this movie joins my very short worst movies of all time list
<START> creature comforts in america should have been released on a different network or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes unfortunately this was not the case given that american audiences seemingly have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes or has a preoccupation with scatological functions both sound and smells shows like this will be few and far between one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching which is sad but not unexpected i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface but thanks to political correctness such conversations take place only in my mind
<START> a family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order people die and so will you if you try to sit through this if you've ever had any desire to see bad actors many with ill fitting dentures act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance this is just awful its so bad i thought al adamson one of the worst directors ever directed it but i was wrong br br its so bad i don't want to say anything more about it not because it isn't polite but because once i start i may not be able to stop br br avoid
<START> i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't wait br br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together great show
<START> possibly very minor spoilers br br this movie is billed as the first russian horror movie unfortunately as far as i am concerned the witch its russian title will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible russian movies it is based on nikolai gogol's story viy which is a classic in russia based is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required instead the less you know about gogol the better br br it is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture the spate of american remakes of foreign films is a prime example but then again sturgess turned kurosawa's seven samurai into the magnificent seven with splendid results and kurosawa transferred shakespeare's macbeth into japan to make an incredibly powerful throne in blood while king lear became a riveting ran however with the witch we have russians transplanting a russian classical tale onto the american soil the movie was shot in estonia in english with the aim of dubbing it into english using american actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements br br as a natural consequence lost is the colorful ukrainian background for the story in comes a drab american small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual gone is the boozy seminarian khoma brutus instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win pullitzer prize and who at the same time writes about x files like events and frequents miss boobs contests i never thought pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing now i humbly stand corrected in a strange nod to russianness the journalist is named ivan berkhoff they should've named him john smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed clichÃ©d and generic than this movie br br berkhoff goes to a town named castleville gets stranded on a dirt road staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather un welcomed by an old crone all that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful and people better staying indoors and avoiding water need i mention that it's raining really hard after a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest he's mistaken for a priest and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights at this point the action supposedly starts those who have time to kill are welcome to it br br what is wrong with this film everything starting with the dialog and down to the prop department the dialog which i heard in russian was clearly originally written in english and it was compiled exclusively from clichÃ©s and platitudes picked from american films the actors just as clearly struggled with english because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural and the russian dubbing followed suit the acting is mostly atrocious and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions for the most part they're just blank or you wish they were the only exceptions being the sheriff played by lembit ulfsak a fine estonian actor and arnis lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of castleville oh and a rooster of course who's absolutely natural on camera i know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film br br there wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either mind you this comment's coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror the film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genre's inception at a critical moment the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp the lamp promptly goes out it must have seen a few horror movies too an example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera he's wearing something the looks like loincloth it doesn't get any more idiotic than this br br those in russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller i wasn't thrilled either it was run of the mill from start to finish i particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not therefore some of them acted zombie like just in case br br the makers of the film say it's about finding faith such a fine collections of idiotic actions stupidly contrived moments and yes clichÃ©s doesn't deserve to be about finding faith the movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum
<START> now please don't start calling me names like unpatriotic weirdo and more br br the very length of this movie 4 hours is its biggest mistake no editing at all seems like j p dutta fell in love with his project too much even lagaan was 4 hours long but it was entertaining and gave a message as well br br it's based on true incidents and real people kudos to it but were the repetitive war scenes really needed on top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all br br between the skirmishes there were songs about loneliness lovesickness and related stuff there were chummy conversations in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk br br why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near and when they were shot it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place br br music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie br br acting was the saving grace from seasoned veterans like sanjay dutt and ajay devgan to relative newbies like abhishek bachchan and akshaye khanna everyone acted like a pro manoj bajpai and ashutosh rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary br br dialogues ranged from brilliant from madhuri with love to illogical monotonous pakistan se zyada musalman hindusthan mein hain and the expletive spree consisting of all the mcs bcs cs and f words wasn't really required br br loc kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave indian soldiers but tries too hard and ultimately fails indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute
<START> just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection shot on 35mm and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k and projected with 2k projector at etc usc theater in hwd so much for tech stuff 18 directors including alexander payne wes cravens joel and ethan coen gus van sant walter salles and gerard depardieu among several good french international directors were each given 5 minutes to make a love story they come in all shapes and forms with known actors elijah wood natalie portman steve buscemi totally hilarious maggie glyllenhall nick nolte geena rowlands soo good and she actually wrote the piece she was in msr depardieu and many good international actors as well the stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex payne's touching study of a woman discovering herself to van sant and one of those things that happens anywhere maybe nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences with english subtitles and a small amount of actual english spoken though that will probably relegate it to art houses a la diva also only one piece that might be considered experimental but colorful and funny as well the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships all easy to follow unless the experimental one irritates your desire for a formulaic story several brought up some emotions for me i admit i am affected by love in cinema when it is presented in something other than sentimentality i even laughed at a mime piece like no other i have seen thank you for that the film hit its peak for me somewhere around a little more than half way through then the last two sequences picked up again some beautiful shots of paris at night lush romantic kind of music usually used to good effect not just schmaltz for emotions in sound generally good cinematography though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldn't have meant to have been main character in shot scene pacing of each film was good and overall structure though a bit long they left out two of what was to be 20 films but said all would be on the dvd seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance not sure when it comes out but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work and sometimes what doesn't work if it covers too much time emotionally for a short film should be in region one when released but they didn't know when
<START> completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphic depiction of the heroine's affair with the beast a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women that's pretty much what he does and the film's depiction of the beast is really really awful it's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge pvc tube for a hard on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid for fans of fake animal porn i guess maybe this is a real turn on i was amused however by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square
<START> when i saw the commercial for this i was all about seeing it now forgive me but it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went suffice it to say the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the movie they sold me on br br i was bored annoyed and incredibly disappointed by this movie and if it wasn't bad enough they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music not exactly mood setting music for a horror movie eh mon i guess if you never saw the commercial or trailer i suppose you may think this is some hot stuff for my money the commercial was way better
<START> firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it i find it the most annoying program on tv there is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience that way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is however i give credit to the acting talents of the young cast it sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was the show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the cbbc presenters why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me that is all
<START> this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells notably that he will marry king louis xv's daughter problem is la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan br br propelled by good sword fights cavalcades and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought look out for noel roquevert a traditional heavy in french films trying to steal la lollo making himself a nuisance and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo's hand and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust driven king louis xv that is not all so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952 the film may have come out that year but its verve cheek superb narration immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular do see it
<START> indian summer it was very nostalgic for me i found it funny heartwarming and absolutely loved it anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the good ole' days for a brief time really needs to see this one it starts out as 20 years later a group of old campers returns for a reunion i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself the actors were great and it contains an all star cast everyone in it played a terrific role you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives this is also a good family movie for the most part i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat highly recommended
