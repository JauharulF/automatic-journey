<START> after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler diva las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap styled number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad libbing until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to rose's turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from beaches it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must
<START> the story on the island texel photographer bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob gets entangled in a dangerous network will kathleen be able to win his trust br br review the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what motivates their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown up woman camera work is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a 7 10
<START> this movie was bad this movie was horrible the acting was bad the setting was unrealistic the story was absurd a comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night most of the world's population decided to watch this comet then the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation people's clothes are still intact there are plants which are still alive but the people were turned to dust no bones nothing thats ridiculous how can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact br br even better the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child the insane clown posse scare me more and they're supposed to look stupid br br then there were the survivors people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie dom and death how can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks br br equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television br br the stupidest part of the movie however are the characters it focuses on two valley girls and chakotay from star trek voyager these three characters were totally unrealistic who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie and most of them were dreams in between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes south park seem intelligent the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos don't see this movie ever
<START> my title ought to be enough br br it baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence dumas flaubert balzac maupassant would churn out such tosh as the nouvelle vague cinematic movement until the 20th century france had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy but the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like wooohooo look how weird i can be plot theme pshaw let's film an amusement park ride going round round at least this is not as bad as godard who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples' heads oh la la quel artiste no truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity but so does the security camera at a quickie mart the two are indistinguishable br br haha just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds i bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now but don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review br br anyway if you like french literature you will hate this people who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of jack kerouac or maybe hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy or maybe they have read the lyrics to the doors songs and they think that's profoundly moving whatever floats yer boat i find it ironic that this film injects some weak allusions to balzac one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived nice try truffles but you're nowhere near the ballpark br br avoid this film like an aids infected syringe br br if you're the type of person who likes to think then stick to jean cocteau orphee robert bresson pickpocket and the japanese masters kurosawa ikuru kobayashi kaidan and teshigahara suna no onna br br if you're an idiot enjoy your truffaut godard and andy worhol and for pete's sake push that vein back in your neck you look like a cabbage
<START> this is hands down the worst movie of all time a combination of whoopie goldberg the worst actress person in history and a talking dinosaur ala jar jar binks add up to a painfully bad movie that was an understatement this movie is unwatchable for the love of god do not watch this movie
<START> i happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hip hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up that's how it was billed on the box anyhow and i thought to myself what a great idea plus there's a welcome to oakland sign on the cover too how could i resist unfortunately the hip hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme neither hip hop music nor hip hop culture had much of a role in the movie having lived in oakland myself i know that there are many aspiring hip hop artists there so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick why the quiroz brothers didn't take advantage of this is beyond me br br once the film got rolling it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and latino you might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie but it didn't somehow the quiroz brothers vision of urban culture boils down to drive by shootings and dropping an f bomb in every line in the movie the rapid fire use of the word fuck is probably this movie's most distinguishing characteristics there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no line didn't contain it at least once i'm not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers also the quiroz brothers and the script was generally very poor br br the film was generally a disappointment it would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick but hood of the living dead doesn't deliver on that count the characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else there was no distinct flavor to the movie it's just another run of the mill low budget flick with bad acting lousy writing amateurish direction bland cinematography a cheap soundtrack and nothing at all to recommend it
<START> this was one scary movie br br brad pitt deserved an oscar for this br br a traveling novelist played by david duchovny of the x files fame and his girlfriend pick up two hitch hikers juliette lewis and brad pitt on their way to california br br on their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book duchovny's character is working on little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car
<START> i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough br br scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana in this version tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s early 1980s tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction br br many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years robert loggia as tony's patron frank lopez is wonderful his character is flawed by being too trusting and as tony quickly figures out soft lopez's right hand omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors f murray abraham amadeus suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank it is like he does not have a mind of his own tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin training day mel without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply it's your tree frank you're sitting in it ' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection br br tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children br br all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels depalma let it all fly right here
<START> james cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot 'soft' characters in his career this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in br br cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it he plays the role with a lot of confidence he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in br br the movie is directed by lloyd bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre his earliest '30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as 42nd street his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really '30's musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in '40's and later made musicals mainly from the mgm studios br br as usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch so do the characters and actors that are portraying them sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines br br the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though i'm not a too big fan of the genre itself once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty he often played little boys babies mice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical gold diggers of 1933 of one year earlier br br a recommendable early genre movie br br 8 10
<START> the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw 24 the speed things are happening is amazing and it's so surprising thrilling and even interesting it's almost as if you are reading a book once you start it it's very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu i was sitting 6 40 hours which means 10 episodes sounds funny and crazy but i'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't stop this series is one of the best of it's kind and it's build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way
<START> in her autobiography laureen bacall reveals that bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that at the time douglas sirk was labeled weepies for women actually he was restored to favor at least in europa after he stopped directing and when he filmed written on the wind sirk had only three movies to make tarnished angels a time to love and a time to die his masterpiece imho and finally imitation of life 1960 then there was silence actually bacall and hudson characters do not interest sirk they are too straight too virtuous dorothy malone who was some kind of substitute for his former german star zarah leander and her brother robert stack provide the main interest of the plot a plot constructed continuously most of the movie being a long flashback the instability of the brother and the sister from a family of rich texan oil owners is brought to the fore by garish clothes and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape malone's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning suit and chignon toying with a small derrick she's ready for life the rebel is tamed now alone because she's lost hudson but anyway he was not in love with her this end is a bit reactionary but melodrama is par excellence reactionary three years later in imitation of life sarah jane susan kohner will be blamed because she does not know her place
<START> for shame for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel the movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality the plot was there one seemed to go no where the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances i gave up about 3 4 of the way through and turned it off a 1 for awful only because there is nothing lower don't waste your time on this one you'll not miss anything
<START> first of all this movie is not a comedy unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh secondly the movie is slow and boring the acting is not bad but not special there is a lucky luke comic about two families one with big noses and one with big ears fighting each other in a small town you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule there is a similar subject comedy '' the home teachers'' this had some good moments my final comment is do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film
<START> i haven't seen the original but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far wicker man is the worst movie i've seen this year maybe even in two years i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it br br i'll give it two positive nods the sarcasm of cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful sorry that's it here come the jeers the movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give cage any straight answers and he puts up with this how this could go on for over an hour of my time much less days in the movie is beyond me br br not to mention that the plot is full of holes you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library how anyone could read this script and think yes people should pay 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like is beyond me br br do not go see this flick or even rent it on dvd
<START> much like the early horror film the boogens the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen although animal house's stephen furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest his performance is more comedy than horror br br the plot an extremely tired one has three sexy women bach lamm and lois young unable to find a hotel for the evening so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator exceptionally played by the deceased sydney lassick if you have ever seen any horror film you know that lovable il' sydney is a deranged psycho so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies br br the three women are all very attractive especially barbara bach but lois young a helen hunt clone is the only one to go nude as sydney watches her take a bath
<START> this was one of the most boring movies i've ever seenÂ i don't really know whyÂ just your run of the mill stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead story has been told a thousand times nothing new or innovative about it at all br br i don't really know what was wrong with this film most of the time when these kinds of actors actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before it's really entertaining there are usually little clever thing in them that aren't really in any other for some reason this one just doesn't hold your attention you can pick out some funny parts or clever ideas in it but for some reason they're just not funny nor clever in any wayÂ i wish i new how to explain it but i don'tÂ just don't waste your time on this oneÂ
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can't say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar i'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film regina lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this
<START> regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem la bÃªte of 1975 one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors la bÃªte is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy tale like atmosphere quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise the fact that beastiality of sorts is one of the film's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience br br pierre de l'esperance guy trÃ©jan the head of a french aristocratic family has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin pierre benedetti to marry lucy broadhurst lisbeth hummel the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family due to an old curse mathurin's uncle marcel daliÃ³ is strictly against the wedding when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda sirpa lane and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever dream without giving away too much i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film as bizarre as it is la bÃªte is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style settings and cinematography the fever dream like atmosphere is present within and out of dream sequences the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic elegant female nudity ravishing actresses to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting close ups on horses' genitalia while having intercourse in either case it is not likely to be forgotten the entire cast of la bÃªte is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters some of which are seriously demented the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast be it lisbeth hummel in the lead finnish actress sirpa lane who sadly died of aids in 1999 as the ancestor in the dream sequences or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard br br i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film the scenes with the eponymous 'beast' definitely being among them certainly not everybody's cup of tea but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema a true cult gem
<START> i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thin which doesn't inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it but i can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was he in what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please universal br br guess i will just have to content myself with peter carey's excellent secret history of the kelly gang 4 10
<START> its hard to make heads or tails of this film unless you're well oiled and in the mood to mock don't view santa claus it mixes santa satan merlin and moralizing in a most unappetizing way it certainly is not for fretful children
