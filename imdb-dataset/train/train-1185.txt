<START> in his 1966 film blow up antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of british youth protesters by setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements antonioni questioned intentionally or not the effectiveness of these organisations how can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie on the flip side the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of blow up they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had it was a very cautionary and mature little film br br with zabriskie point antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of blow up and goes full blown hippie the result is a film awash with bad metaphors stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling how could somebody who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence make something so silly br br the film opens with a nice series of close ups as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution suddenly one man mark gets up and leaves he hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution he recognises that though revolutionaries fight for freedom to bind oneself to such a militant cause is to effectively give your freedom away and so like jack nicholson in the passenger mark just wants to be free br br as such mark buys a gun and goes solo he takes orders from no one when police raid his university campus mark shoots a guy and runs away he then flees to a nearby airfield steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities with their billboards and hollow modern appliances he sees the desert as a sort of garden of eden br br in the desert mark meets daria and quickly falls in love antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand free from the constraints of modern life these tree huggers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun br br the film ends with mark dying and daria fantasising about blowing up the mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him it's antonioni's challenge to his audience pick up the guns pickets and explosives he says tear the walls down before they cage you in br br of course the film had no effect on its audience they recognised zabriskie point as being just another self centred commercial attempt at being radical a sort of commodified radicalism it felt untruthful and tame br br thematically the film is pretty stupid antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world and the fat cats who exploit you you should either flee to the desert mark or actively fight the system daria that's all well and good but though artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares they're all mostly unable to show us how to effectively administer change like the end of fight club nihilism and violence achieve nothing in the real world social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors spurred ahead by minor technological advancements i mean what liberated women more than contraceptives br br 3 10 a very bad film the problem is antonioni does not really believe in rebellion he is a quiet and contemplative man an introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to garner more adoration from the counterculture who embraced his earlier film blow up as such zabrinskie point comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film it's essentially a 50 year old man say look at me i'm a daring rebel br br there are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight the system but they all fall into one of four categories in the first category you have films like network cool hand luke cuckoo's nest and spartacus these all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure though in each case the spirit of revolution survives the message is that you can not effect change but by dying or failing the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope br br then you have films like fight club zabriskie point and falling down which simply encourage you to explode tear it all down blow it all up everything is a lie so you might as well go out guns blazing these films are borne out of angry reactionary feelings rather than any sort of common sense br br then you have the flight rather than fight category terrence malick and antonioni are the masters of this genre films like the passenger red desert and badlands show human beings running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves both directors are pessimists in that malick has his islands destroyed and antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution br br then you have the fourth category films like donnersmarck's the lives of others ashby's bound for glory and kubrick's a clockwork orange treat artists as a force of change and rebellion in these dystopian worlds in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist criminal who keeps the system in check by simply existing outside of the herd you create waves your comments actions and critical eye challenges the status quo as such donnersmarck's film has novelists and artists undermining nazi germany whilst kubrick has alex the artist criminal fighting nazi droogs painting the town in blood and sperm
<START> this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasn't expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if you're not sure just watch it anyway it's only an hour and a half of your life you're going to live for 80 years anyway
<START> with the current trend of gross out humor this film is the granddaddy of them all while some of the humor is dated every skit will either shock repulse or make you laugh out loud most memorable is the sex games commentary and of course the vd commercial it doesn't always work but pays off when it does i give this a 7
<START> a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non heroes plan to sell to the iranians low rent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half baked one liners
<START> the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former br br but consider this short again there is nothing 'objective' about it the film is full of action a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it restrict it limit it br br worse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen all seeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie
<START> very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee li is excellent as the low key librarian cop who saves all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable the villain the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits can some one help me out with that thanks enjoy hak hap or black mask in any language its good entertainment
<START> i saw brigadoon on tv last night 12 sept 2009 i am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen the accents were shameful the local children's club would have produced better sets the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film
<START> little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version big edie says to little edie if you're stuck it's only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea come home edie let me take care of you br br yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br great documentary br br 9 10
<START> this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lost and any cassettes i made are also long gone br br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin esp little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original br br even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon
<START> it's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but i know that humor is very subjective i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts br br in the year this was made 1930 stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly in addition this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan i would say this was an experiment that really did not work as someone else said it does not play to their strengths too much dialog and plot br br the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff br br if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto or brats from the same year br br they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts they made something like 108 films altogether very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some county hospital me and my pal the live ghost the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts quite a record in my book br br if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe
<START> coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers directors and actors the first film adaptation of w somerset maugham's of human bondage titillated countless moviegoers it has no shock value today just fine acting br br while the cast is excellent this is bette davis's first great role and one of leslie howard's best performances howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college one by the way that seems to have no female students at that time there would have been at least a few perhaps author physician maugham didn't care for distaff medicos br br having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress mildred rogers bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle's his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply i don't mind a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's plumbing the depths maugham's mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street walking something not clearly brought out here br br carey's besotted prostration serves rogers' avaricious need for support of the financial kind he is desperately in love with her she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument no sex here recognizing that he is getting nowhere he begins a chaste relationship with norah a woman who adores him re enter mildred replete with a baby and in her usual need of being taken care of exit heartbroken norah br br another separation from mildred and carey begins a long term friendship with sally abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring br br the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham's excellent novel howard's carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double barreled shotgun mildred is unrestrainedly wicked a user of the worst kind her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words and offers at one point she promises she'll do anything he wants a daring statement for the times and one i'm sure audiences fully understood br br pre code it may be but mildred's quick march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency the ending is conventional sin loses principled behavior triumphs br br director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars one well established the other established largely because of this film the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking br br available on dvd br br 9 10 for davis's and howard's performances
<START> a rousing adventure form director george stevens before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger inspired space opera star wars 1977 to the similarly plotted raiders of the lost arc 1981 br br the biggest reason for the picture's success however is the pitch perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy cary grant is the ultimate comic foil and douglas fairbanks jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength a huge hit in its day the film was reportedly the second biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind and it remains arguably the best film of its kind
<START> this movie is just horrible it's boring it's low quality the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious br br the main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but he's ugly overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's br br all the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends the married couple hasn't seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends the date of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick up at a bar now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie br br do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon i've made home movies scarier than this br br
<START> i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and i must say i was extremely disappointed and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role depending on what you think about danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her instead she is completely unlikeable the other great actresses do an ok job but certainly don't light up the screen out of all the great actresses in this movie i'd say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end br br horrible screenplay as well it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character
<START> with the advent of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two time academy award winner glenda jackson can find 'the return of the soldier' among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann margret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross referencing that goes on here so why isn't this movie out on dvd don't the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film and 'the return of the soldier' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people
<START> there's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead br br it's only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as likability is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker br br 1 after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off br br 2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault br br 3 don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him br br 4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her br br 5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one on one no point in being unfair right br br now i'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing this kills the enjoyability of the entire film br br in case you were wondering the scriptwriters didn't stop with dim witted characters since they themselves are surely dim witted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window br br 1 the stalker kills a cop inside a police station Â while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away br br 2 the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior br br 3 the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being br br 4 the suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever in fact some scenes were direct rip offs from american movies br br the only positive is the decapitation near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife it's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field br br truly the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves better yet they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
<START> this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood the performances were horrible even boman irani who always manages to shine goes completely ott as the villain the soundtrack is not memorable either and in spite trying hard the female leads don't manage to be sexy vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written clichÃ© roles it's high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat hope he never directs another eyesore like this future of hindi movies are in better hands now to sum it up stay far away from waste of celluloid
<START> 2 stars for kay francis she's wonderful and she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way br br the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband she's going to the movies the hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that kay's not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands face first in a pond lake and dies now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based br br 1 the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder whaaaaa i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever br br 2 the hubby's lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that it's all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that she's the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place br br i can't even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the pre code days you'd never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis br br steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens md and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage i'm sure there's other great kay flicks as well but i'm only mentioning the ones i've seen and can recommend
<START> i have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching supposedly a movie had been made in the past but i'd never been able to locate it well my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l'engle's excellent book to the screen br br as i watched the movie i had the highest of hopes as the film went on i became more and more despondent they had botched it badly never had i been so let down by a favorite book to film adaption i understand that films can't stick strictly to a book but they don't need to change things for the sake of it most if not all of departures from the book were totally unnecessary br br i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie well it wasn't just me nearly every single one felt the same way cheated out of the great story that madeline l'engle had so skillfully created br br why they wondered did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie why couldn't calvin's hair have been red why did mrs which not have the proper witch like outfit that was such a clever play on her name basically we all wondered why did nearly every single detail have to be changed br br i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make i am still waiting for that movie this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses i'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task
<START> somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and i'll start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wow br br spoilers for ang lee's hulk and the incredible hulk br br was it boring i almost didn't make it through ang lee's hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and that's no fun he's usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie ever br br but then something happened about 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare i say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good that's not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies and that's quite a feat br br of course the ending got really stupid with bruce banner's father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man's brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expected br br ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what it's boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here's the thing the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than ang lee's they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could br br worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee's failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesn't do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lee's version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk he's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br this is how i can definitively say ang lee's version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lee's version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely i'd just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience at least in ang lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of course br br it is absolutely mind boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lee's hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br it is to edward norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
