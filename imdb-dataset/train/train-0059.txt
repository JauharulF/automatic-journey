<START> though cher and cage are the focal points of this story gardenia and dukakis are good counterparts for them this is where loretta and ronny will be in 50 years still in love the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john mahoney it shows a real slice of life though i saw this long ago i am glad it finally catapulted cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments this is a very entertaining movie
<START> neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment br br lemmon is neatnik felix ungar bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite br br funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date the priceless interaction between lemmon matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters a pair of geese in disney's the aristocats and here their comic timing on top of lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time br br if you're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work this one is not to be missed matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and of course it's easy to see why it became a top rated tv show later on br br summing up top simon comedy not to be missed
<START> i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching
<START> the extraordinary rosemary forsyth is the main reason to see this flick why she never became a bigger store may never be known but she is exceptional and steals every scene she's in garson kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate with robert drivas and brenda vaccaro especially memorable a 9 out of 10
<START> br br as with the other episodes in this made for tv series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend horatio hornblower's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense br br as little wesley crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of horatio hornblower immeasurably superior hornblower's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command a perfect being makes for dull story telling so superior is our hero that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every move br br what is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time what is the point of watching such a story
<START> this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i've ever seen and that's saying something the chant of viva chiba viva chiba is heard at the title soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid stupid the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them of course that's our man sonny chiba the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard but what are her true intentions let me say at this point who cares soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills end of story oh yeah the woman was corrupt too congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever br br as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film that's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70's karate scene was at the time watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student bad editing punching him in the throat but everything is badly done in this film terrible unbelievable fights fake i mean fake blood bad acting dubbing wardrobe and let's not forget the story one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country i bet fight after fight is laughable this was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie let's see he kicks a gun in half kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene give me a break not to mention the fact that it's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it's filmed so poorly one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture ok as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood really fake blood too say it looked poorly made is and understatement the acting is totally non existent in this film i don't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good but it wasn't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent as expected from a 70's wardrobe you'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time don't try and hide it now the characters were stupid as well the pimp club owner's one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling it was very annoying br br overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making that doesn't mean that it's not entertaining with a film made so poorly it's hard not to laugh through most of this film if you can stomach it this was an old favorite watch with my best friend if it was purely bad i would give one star but the laughs it delivers bumps it up 4 out 10
<START> has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the waiter laughed at the end i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter albeit quickly
<START> i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting it was at least not like the teen slasher movies that pop out every now and then the search for the killer and the 'partner' relationship between the hero the so called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie also i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie i mean it's exciting maybe some time later i might watch the movie again
<START> this is what i call a pre sci fi sci fi movie it gets no better than lugosi karloff in this incredibly good mood type motion picture these two genuine artists are at their very best as is the story line br br karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity pride and scientific competition i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in br br this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role it might be possible to do it almost as good br br this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced as i said it gets no better no way
<START> when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society when a comedian actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves do i want to support that behavior in this case mr foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong good behavior from bad that loving kindness is better than hatefulness mr foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from saying sorry does not get him off the hook it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it no longer see anything they are part of we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them
<START> i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do this film was void of all the video whore clichÃ©s and it also skipped the gangsters rappers and foul language it examined several relationships among physicians african americans and african american male female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time i saw it at the boston film festival as well it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences black people and everyone else would love a movie like this if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there br br as an extra if your a doctor a resident a medical student a premedical student married to a doctor have a doctor sibling have a doctor in the family or know a great doctor period they would love this film as well it portrayed residency and the practice in a true to life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors residents and medical students who viewed the film dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine so he definitely applied his knowledge experience to the film and that is greatly apparent
<START> i bought this a year or more ago for 2 yep 2 left it on the shelf for ages now watching dvds while holed up with a cold br br this is a haunting movie brilliant performances by all involved especially the 6yo boy about the only smiles you get in this movie br br plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever grosse pointe blank but obviously that's lighthearted this is heavy hearted br br as a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed scary stuff brilliant work all round br br pete
<START> phantom lady 1944 dir robert siodmak br br production universal pictures br br scott henderson alan curtis following a nasty fight and split with his wife looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole there he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and looking for some companionship asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems she agrees but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves sure enough when scott gets home he finds the police there waiting to question him his wife's been murdered where were you at 8 o'clock this evening asks inspector burgess thomas gomez but scott has an alibi right only he doesn't know the woman's name and the bartender remembers scott but not the woman neither does the cab driver nor the drummer elisha cook jr at the club even the dancer at the club who scott clearly caught looking at the woman they were both wearing the same hat won't acknowledge there was someone with him something is going on but whatever it is scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife's murder on the flimsiest 'evidence' in hollywood judicial history it's left to his loyal secretary 'kansas' ella raines who's later joined by a sympathetic inspector burgess to find out the real killer before scott is executed br br phantom lady is built on themes that recur almost compulsively in woolrich's work for example the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in black angel and the leopard man additionally there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in rendezvous in black and the bride wore black it can leave a viewer feeling like he's treading on well worn ground but in the right hands the feverish plots sorry dialogue the narrative inconsistencies all are beside the point fortunately phantom lady was being guided by sound hands br br this is siodmak's first noir he would go on to distinguish himself as one of the if not the preeminent practitioners of the style the killers criss cross here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer woody bredell they would be reunited on christmas holiday and the killers there is some great storytelling done in the camera in one shot the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3 way mirror suggesting multiple personalities the same character who is an artist has van gogh's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment but what siodmak and bredell are really doing in phantom lady is practically creating the look for noir released very early in 1944 it's all here the wet pavement the bags of atmosphere and dread the sharply contrasting b w the wildly expressionistic versions of reality when kansas visits scott in prison the discordant shafts of light etc it is a terrific picture to look at br br franchot tone aside the cast as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director and presumably the budget suggests 'b' movie ambitions i thought tone was a little hammy alan curtis high sierra is not up to much and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes ella raines is mostly good and quite beautiful her 'sex scene' with elisha cook jr is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed another standout scene is when kansas goes after the bartender to question him it amounts to a chase scene as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets with a stop at a subway station some real good tension in there br br out of 4
<START> dolph lundgren is back detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years and that is following the delayed hidden agenda this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips agent red and stormcatcher however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda which was better in almost every respect what this film does have in it's favour from dolph's previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again br br the films story is ludicrous and prime b movie material an ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a detention class he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe br br where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse there are some good moments you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen br br as for the cast hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film this however has problems the actors are on the most part bad the bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters they all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability this movie is all about dolph though while this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst it also marks a turning point in his career he is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slow mo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one it is good to see dolph looking energised his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it br br overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm
<START> one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they the yuppies are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies
<START> ti s and as lots of boobies some great characters fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the amercan pie franchise this feels like really old school it feels a bit like porkys for the 2000's some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me br br whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one this movie i found really entertaining lets not get too excited you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is but for what it is it excels the characters are likable and funny the girls are hotter than hell the fun and games are hilarious with some stuff i've never seen before in comedies they make me cringe but laugh at the same time br br so ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think don't expect the classic american pie but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so
<START> i can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad it's like the tv station are desperate for anything anything at all they're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant where does all this fake light come from that and all that stupid bickering between the characters they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping but because it's such bad directing and acting you will not your florence nightingale fix with this flick sorry i'm joining the negative feedback and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever
<START> i don't remember when i first heard about this movie but i rented it about six years ago and it still remains one of my favorite comedies i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music but if you are a rap fan even a casual one you will love the inside jokes and references one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b and a h i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it one of the best performances comes from larry scott who played nerd lamar in revenge of the nerds' it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release
<START> this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs the characters are uni dimensional and have no other development in the story there's actually no story either than looking for each other and kissing it's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional resonance on top of that it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive clichÃ©s of the cinematic snobbery but anyway if someone can identify with its heavy banality i guess that's fine
<START> fine performances and art direction do not a good movie make this movie is so grim and depressing i could feel absolutely no joy at the happy ending involving the union strike the attempts at humor involving lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous and any movie involving a baldwin brother already has a strike against it on a positive note lang is still one of america's great underrated actors he alone almost makes this worth keeping in the vcr i give this a 4
