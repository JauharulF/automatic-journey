<START> from the view of a nascar maniac like i am the movie is interesting you can see many race cars from 1983 even tough the racing scenes are not that much realistic but i have to admit that i haven't seen any race before 1995 because before that time they didn't show any nascar races in germany br br from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80's burt behind the wheel of a fast car like in his bandit movies br br if you love nascar and burt reynolds this movie is a must see if you only love one of this 2 things i also recommend to watch it if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds you still should give it a chance but remember this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award br br it is the typical humor of the 80's if you like movies like the cannonball movies and police academy you will also like that one
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's extremely boring with lots of boring dialog and has some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature the only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got the plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale no blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds the acting is terrible richard cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying glen roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all mark siegel is extremely annoying and was also not funny bob hyman is decent but not much more then that richard garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with kacey cobb what so ever kacey cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with richard overall avoid this piece of garbage at all costs bomb out of 5
<START> i watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in paris it was my last evening in the french capital and the best good bye i could have chosen these twenty episodes made me relive the impressions i had collected in paris in a heart warming manner without drifting off into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz each episode is full of surprise strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good short story to me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently the stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly each episode was seen from a different ankle had a different topic a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonic orchestra of films the most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload just the other way round the melange of sadness melancholy pure joy despair wrath anxiety curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony and not to forget the all over topic of love love between the characters love between the characters and paris and also the love of the directors and actors actresses for this project i don't want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many but i must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project some played with their image some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before so intertextuality was given all through the movie all in all i can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on dvd
<START> what a pathetic movie br br i won't waste much time commenting about it i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it br br let me leave it simply with shaq has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both discplines it's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds br br much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is shaq
<START> the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty beauty is all around in actors' play andie is superb as always in well designed shots and in authors' red line idea the love br br i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be when he's gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires br br the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life prevails in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectly br br another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and fags and accents and andie again is doing superb job it is a shame that this movie got such low marks 10 out of ten
<START> this almost unknown gem was based on a french farce which shows and i mean that as a compliment br br caroline lee is being courted by a wealthy argentinian roland who asks her father for her hand in marriage but caroline is already married to anthony colman who has just arrived by plane and launches immediately into an audience directed reminiscence about the last time caroline decided she was in love with someone else a dilettante ish sculptor gardiner the film plays out the story of anthony's strategy in uncoupling caroline from her sculptor and how that experience aids him with her argentinian br br it is perfectly cast ronald colman is at his most sophisticated and charming reginald gardiner is at his most priggish gilbert roland is at his most exotic and anna lee is just deliciously whimsical the film is wonderfully directed by lewis milestone who also produced the whole production feels like a labor of love there are wonderful touches such as colman breaking frame and addressing the camera and exceptional use of a sliding bar cabinet door it is a sin that it hasn't been released on dvd this is the kind of film that can singlehandedly awaken interest in classic film
<START> i first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college accounting professor recommended it to me i was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime maggie smith is delightful and ustinov plays the retro hacker perfectly o nolo mio
<START> every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy br br where to begin my discussion of pain for starters there was a musical montage every five minutes there was no character development every character was a stereotype we had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry the concept for this movie sounded so funny how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors but trust me when i say this things went wrong very wrong
<START> don't let the premise fool you this was one funny movie the problem it wasn't supposed to be a comedy the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes even worse the set up is never explained you will leave the theater asking is that it i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with there are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie let this one come out on video before wasting your money
<START> you talking' to me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night his friend can't believe the change but he scores with faith ford and get's a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big br br this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump br br xx
<START> the plot is so manipulative counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision the children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as i say the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots and therefore in that case making more sense out of their actions and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore how did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the last place to be searched why would the 2 boys never be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched there is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this asking to believe it would then do to trial even the informal setting is too insulting to bare
<START> jean claude van damme plays twin brothers alex and chad both whom are martial arts expert who team up to take down the mobsters responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty headed martial arts actioner which doesn't have a plot that would make better use of the gimmick of having two jean claude van dammes some okay actionscenes but this is not one of van damme's best
<START> i won't add to the plot reviews it's not very good br br very improbable orphanage on bala br br cushing and lee at their height br br some nice scenery br br good for face spotting and i quote look at the mouth that is cassie from fools and horses br br otherwise a poor example of the british film industry br br fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best br br redeeming feature it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription i won't be subscribing on this effort
<START> okay the promos promised a comedy and people few went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing or for that matter of any year because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some more br br okay coming to jawani diwani br br review in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it's annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitley br br cringeworthy dialogues comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes br br direction is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it's touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible
<START> with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series like with any hit cinema event there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju giant monster genre many sought after success a few gained it one of the few that not only profited but garnered popularity was gamera a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion but unlike godzilla gamera was marketed as a friend to all children later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril and thus gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies unfortunately that's about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to while the new gamera movies directed by shusuke kaneko are marvelous revolutionary monster movies the original series including the original is nothing special br br the first gamera movie titled in japan as the giant monster gamera was clearly a godzilla want to be even though the movie was produced in the era of color films it was shot in black and white why to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s gamera also attacks tokyo because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie i don't know much about the japanese version for the version i am familiar with the americanized version where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film now whether this adds or takes away from the film i cannot say but gammera the invincible is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself br br gammera the invincible is a very routine orientated movie the characters are from a stock of science fiction standards the story is inane the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization the acting is laughable and so on and so forth the only thing that differentiates it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie but that's also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts gamera's rampage is completely phony and ridiculous now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie br br and although shusuke kaneko would later transform gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s in the original series gamera was not an attractive screen presence he was neither scary nor sympathetic he just waddles around like a toddler swaying with each step and knocks miniature sets over as usual everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid yoshio uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a 'central' role who thinks gamera is a nice turtle br br most movies in the genre that gammera the invincible is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure even in the company of many other godzilla imitators this gamera film is not a particularly good entry and as far as my cinema experience goes the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse like godzilla gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters and like godzilla he'd get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again br br it's peculiar usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes but in the case of gamera my verdict is just the opposite i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by shusuke kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested the new films are inventive well made exciting and above all fun the original series is a long stream of boredom
<START> william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents treads much of the same territory as tv's the sopranos in terms of the mid life crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since fargo donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macy's wife young david dorfman is excellent as macy's bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound ad libbed and are wonderful even neve campell who i usually find abhorrent is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macy's eye all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences
<START> i've seen this film because i had do my job includes seeing movies of all kinds i couldn't stop thinking who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival it wasn't only boring the actors were awful as well it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie having fond memories of the book as a child i decided to check this out this is a movie that you should really pass on br br it is just not worth seeing it is very boring and uninteresting i feel that it would even be that way to small children it has no magic that the book contains this movie is not horrible but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it br br there are moments that just come off as weird the witch character is not very good the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening i know this is a kids movie so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before br br the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix i really didn't care how it finished skip this film and read the book instead
<START> i've read every book to date in the left behind series and the movie hardly does any of them justice sure i've seen worse movies but this was incredibly disappointing this movie would have made a good mst3k episode the script was a horrible adaptation of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines instead of actually saying them the characters were stiff and unlikeable the effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake the ending was awful first of all it didn't even go all the way through the first book second it made no sense if you hadn't read the book you'd have no idea what was going on it had to have been the most cheesy film student like ending i've ever seen in a movie i'm upset that i actually paid money for this movie if by some miracle it does get wide release they ought to totally overhaul it and let hollywood take over those two wannabe film producers and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals
<START> neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers but then nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew especially one using the gangster con artist movie framework as might be expected from luc besson's name on the credits as producer there's a definite element of 'cinema de look' about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap it looks great has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life the universe and everything if anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences a bit of machiavelli a dash of godard a lot of the principles of chess motifs and techniques littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie rather than a commercial for kabbalism it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central somewhat metaphysical con br br the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger but it's got a lot going for it all the same not worth starting a new religion over but i'm surprised it didn't get a us distributor maybe they found ray liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary
