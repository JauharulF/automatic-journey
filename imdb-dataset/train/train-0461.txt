<START> welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare this horror tale finds a newly married husband john hudson and wife peggy weber haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane or is it the learning challenged gardener mickey alex nicol who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway by the way the lurking gardener nicol is the film's director you can catch this as part of amc's monsterfest
<START> my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long other then that it's pretty good paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage luise rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni they live with muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad when he finally gets some money to buy some more land a drought hits and nothing is growing everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it when a bunch of people start looting the town the military show up and start executing people paul muni does a good job and luise rainer won a second oscar for this movie
<START> in this 1943 film judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big time yet by the man who loves her van heflin this film was certainly a big change for mr heflin especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in johnny eager br br wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren br br the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired it was a gigi like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer
<START> creature unknown is the right word for this movie or maybe it should be called unknown movie this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning it has a really stupid plot really pathetic acting and so so special effects br br some thirty something year old post teens are trapped in the woods with a mad reptilian rubber suit creature lurking around endlessly what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action you have girls walking through the woods talking and then you have guys with heavy mascara on walking through the woods talking the whole thing is so boring br br the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a suit hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image br br this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to act in this truly stupefying movie skip this one for certain
<START> i never bothered to see this movie in theaters although i remember hearing the name over and over i finally watched it this week and what a delight for some reason i was expecting it to not be very good so i was completely surprised when i sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in i read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring but what was wonderful about diana is that she's a true fighter in life all she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there a very intelligent story and i'm amazed that this is the first time up for michelle rodriguez what an excellent job she did adrian and her coach were also quite good br br this film is a little rough around the edges but it doesn't matter in the slightest the story the will and the performances completely outweigh any flaws that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway a compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a k o for michelle rodriguez

<START> all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do the main actors and actresses i e jessica alba michael weatherly etc make you forget you are watching a fictional t v show they seem to make this show come alive all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
<START> usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what i'm talking about a certain running lenghth very showy performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc br br this one is different and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner lost weekend br br gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes i know about american in paris and singing in the rain this one is different he really gets into his character of a sea wolf thinking at first that picking up any girl while on leave is nothing more than a lark and if you had to make up a story to get her so be it until sort of like the music man when he gets his foot caught in the door the eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal sinatra 's attempt to make the story good in order to get the girl that he really and unexpectedly falls in love with you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean br br besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one it's a classic buddy story nostalgia to a time when wwii was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that i can't think of right now br br why not a 10 near the end at nearly 2 1 2 hours starts to feel a bit long there is a small ballet number that gene kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now but overall this ones a definite winner on every level
<START> that film is absolutely fantastic if you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted tomba unziker what a couple and that is probably the worse film in the world but you can enjoy it very much we watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening the best scenes are the first one when the criminals kill the friend of alex and he tries to act like a desperate and the result is a comic scene of first category and then when he shows to leva antevleva what a name the palassio di giusstissia and then the accident of leva that once is going on her car out of the road and a second later the car is completely empty what a magic
<START> with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i can't imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producer's garris's valarie under the stairs but we shall see
<START> horrible horrible horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr is it possible to write ten lines the acting was horrific it had absolutely no flow i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much better in comparison to this one i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile it appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights
<START> amazing that's what you'd say if you sat through this film simply incredibly amazing it's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing that my friends is what is truly scary about this film somebody thought it was a good idea to make it br br well here's another amazingly original story high school student occasionally seemed like collegeÂgo figure has whore for a mom lives in a trailer park and is an artist who is ridiculed for his being all different well of course this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and here's the original part his soul inhabits a scarecrow beneath which he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him awww br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br amazingly funny movieÂeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted br br this and the sequel on one disk in the wal mart 5 00 binÂso it's only a little overpriced br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br the violence and gore are kind of sub standard one person is stabbed with a corncob br br sounds like they put some effort into the musicÂbut it doesn't really fit the movieÂand isn't all that good br br the bad br br terrible terrible acting br br another slasher let down with sexy womenÂnone of them removing clothing when did that cease being a staple of low brow slashers br br ridiculous story br br the scarecrow vomits up one liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush br br standard underlying love story goes nowhere and is poorly done br br some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomÂyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed and you only assume that they must've had it coming br br the ugly br br extremely average slasher fare just with a murdering scarecrow instead ofÂ well all that other crap br br nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger jason voorhees pinhead chucky or even angela from the sleepaway camp seriesÂall of which are better than this atrocity br br the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life the script is laden with a level of retardedness that i never imagined could exist i'm serious hereÂit's a full step beyond terrible don't get me wrong though it's funny as hellÂbut i've never heard more asinine banterÂeven in slumber party massacre iii this film makes jason x look like shakespeare br br the man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow worst wig ever dialogue to match br br memorable scene br br the one where elementary school youths spew out their own witty dialogue hey let's go find small animals to torture huh huh br br acting 3 10 story 3 10 atmosphere 2 10 cinematography 1 10 character development 2 10 special effects make up 5 10 nudity sexuality 1 10 no nudity mom's a whore girls wear no bras violence gore 5 10 low quality mediocre amount dialogue 0 10 extremely ridiculous blatant over the top and painfully funnyÂso bad it's good my first rating for dialogue in any film music 5 10 direction 2 10 br br cheesiness 10 10 crappiness 9 10 br br overall 3 10 br br another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap or slasher film completists this is not a good movie at all laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring br br www residenthazard com
<START> the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn't what i was expecting at all it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can't say anything bad about this movie expcept i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time
<START> the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost all to and for love br br no weaknesses in this fine adaptation
<START> the daughter's words are poetry i can't go on another year i got to get to a hotel room i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves the marble faun is moving in he just gave us a washing machine that's the deal i'm pulverized by this latest thing raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time any little rat's nest mouse hole i'd like better and there is wisdom in the mother's words yes the pleasure is all mine this little book will keep me straight straight as a dye always one must do everything correctly where the hell did you come from bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music i'm your mother remember me the mother daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film this is a mother's day film
<START> going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea especially a romantic fantasy br br little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection br br claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character br br michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty br br robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax br br overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go
<START> this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy especially the end this movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the eels i mean c'mon and i swear i think they use sock puppets for the eels and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldn't finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst3k like comments throughout the movie br br summary only watch this if you're a movie basher make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets
<START> it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance however moronic this illogical 'logic' may be however within the story and theme of the film there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist is the ''villain of the story'' under no circumstances can what she did be justified sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality it is betrayal of the ultimate sort the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring to top it all the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic a woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse there are no other children so in essence his life has been wasted in some societies where justice still prevails such situations result in the execution of the unjust
<START> what can i say about a tale such as this this magical tale has followed me from my early childhood evoking warm memories in my heart the characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums br br the story line was wonderful i wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with mr brown and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war br br i am still a child inside and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other this movie is my definite favorite of all times i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and transported into another time
<START> this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers gershwin and a nice 'parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story well it's not really there or at least not very well worked out the acting is also not so smooth by caron but i liked some of the dialogues i liked the scene at the seine i liked the character played by levant the colors and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent br br a 7 5 8 seems on the dot to me
