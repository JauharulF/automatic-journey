<START> walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in willy's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi retired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and al's reaction priceless
<START> i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film when i watch it i wish that i could be 10 14 again i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent we all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom knowledge of adults wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends parents be young again to not have to worry about your job being a parent etc i know that i would like to jump into a de lorean and go back in time while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is meatballs with bill murray i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that
<START> larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum well the worst mistake evidently is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted obviously this is not a true horror movie at least not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying br br wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend it is obvious that kim the mother is a psychologist but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son this is also a story of alienation it's clear that the father george is a distant figure perhaps a workaholic who seems to be living in a different world br br miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country that part of new york state with its winter landscape barren trees play havoc on the little boy's imagination it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town it creates even more doubts in his young mind ultimately miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything even evoking the wendigo spirit br br the film is well paced and acted patricia clarkson is excellent no matter where movie she is in jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand erik per sullivan as miles conveys the inner turmoil within him i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him finally john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out br br instead of putting this movie down future viewers should approach it with a open mind
<START> so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to mmmÂ to tell the truth the film's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths anyhow by the end of 'while she was out' i was left feeling rather indifferent not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives but there's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced late night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park br br the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story along with the very variable performances the flimsy script was poorly thought out which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events as for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon terrorizing basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand don't ask me why knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotionÂ but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up basinger's performance is stout like but doesn't craft much empathy craig sheffer shows up as her hot headed husband strangely i couldn't keep my eyes off the screenÂ thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thugÂ her choices were quite disappointing watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead br br susan montford's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along i liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photography br br no great shakes doesn't ask much of your time but i wouldn't care to see it again however with the inclusion of a joy division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen
<START> warning possible spoilers below br br the film is more boring then anything else there seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns but none of it works br br mst3k did a fairly good job with it but on its own the movie is mostly tedious br br funny moments br br when the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband who is trying to drive the wife crazy says in a deadpan voice there is no skull there there's no skull br br when the real ghost skulls have the husband caught in a pickle as if trapped between first and second base
<START> the opening credits make for a brilliant atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip all the good guys are good all the bad guys are bad and the film is jam packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make up to hi lite their characteristics br br warren beatty as dick tracy is the ultimate tough guy straight man incorruptable calm usually always a better fighter than the other guy and rarely one to push the limit on legality al pacino as big boy caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best breathless mahoney a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going gleanne headly is tracy's tough talking fiercely independent long time girlfrined and then there's the kid a funny little street urchin tracy takes in who models himself after his surrogate father and saves tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up br br the supporting players are a who's who of character actors charles durning is the chief of police dick van dyke is the district attorney who's bribed by big boy's goons to keep him on the streets dustin hoffman has a humorous turn as mumbles the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say r g armstrong is pruneface one of the rival gangsters big boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city mandy patinkin is 88 keys the piano player for breathless's show paul sorvino plays lips manlis breathless's former benefactor until big boy gives him the bath james caan wears relatively little make up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with big boy's grand plan william forsythe and ed o'ross are big boy's enforcers flattop and itchy br br this movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip plus it is full of vibrant colors almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds all the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie and then some the matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two dimensional only acted in three dimensional sets the humor is plentiful al pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since big boy is kind of crazy and kind of self pitying he's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our founding fathers and likening himself to great political leaders the man with the plan always looking for the smartest way to do business
<START> sharp well made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads i have always liked this approach to film making communicate ideas about a larger more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home br br i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and globalism's effect on poorer nations however people feel about it rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox not that there's anything wrong with that other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads how they are manufactured by what people and under what conditions and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process including workers factory management american importers and finally the consumer at the end of the chain br br i felt a little sickened by this equally by the mardi gras revelers but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end made a particular impression but that was just my reaction i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently br br unlike other documentaries on this subject i don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume if you have ever bought a product made in the far east this should give you something to think about br br outstanding and highly recommended need to see more documentaries like this kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had if you can imagine that there is no decipherable plot or story the special effects are a joke and even the sound is terrible this film was directed by henry sala it was the only film that he ever directed and the reason is obvious
<START> i must admit the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story i mean the synopsis sounded really out there and now that i have just finished watching it i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance hyde and gackt both gave heart wrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie you get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end the element of vampirism which i love but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story i ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn't giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is after all i'm not much of a critic the fact that i'm bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it you can tell what side i'm on with moon child
<START> on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship they dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star this massive craft is populated by only three people presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors anyway to cut a long story short the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies br br the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying 'annoying' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic unhinged frightening dangerous maybe but not 'annoying' but he is the three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles this ship is practically the size of a city considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man made craft could exist never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task despite the vast size of the spaceship the crew all have appallingly kitted out tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs but there are a lot of corridors br br the film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci fi thriller but nothing great
<START> the movie is okay it has it's moments the music scenes are the best of all the soundtrack is a true classic it's a perfect album it starts out with let's go crazy appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up tempo take me with u a fun pop song the beautiful ones a cheerful ballad probably the closest thing to r b on this whole album computer blue a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia darling nikki one of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia when doves cry the climax to this masterpiece i would die 4 u baby i'm a star and of course purple rain a true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album the movie and the album are both very good i highly recommend them
<START> all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori i don't think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended
<START> 'how to lose friends and alienate people' is an entertaining if loose adaptation of toby young's memoir of the same name it's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised simon pegg despite playing an essentially irritating person is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with hollywood names there's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing easy watch kind of a male 'ugly betty' but funnier
<START> i remember being forced yes literally forced to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness it's designed to scare poor suckers into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real life br br check out the chapter on this film in sarah diamond's book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie
<START> i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made if you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever unfortunately joan rivers chose differently the movie is full of predictable gags some of these are racist and very unfunny jokes particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant as i write this i cannot believe this was actually a movie scene the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth rotflmao not the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is i knew i should have been on top ha ha ha ha ah ugh
<START> as anyone old enough knows south africa long suffered under the vile racist oppression of apartheid which completely subjugated the black population one of the most famous anti apartheid activists was steve biko who was murdered in jail following the murder reporter donald woods sought to get biko's message out to the world br br in cry freedom woods kevin kline befriends biko denzel washington before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges when woods attempts to spread biko's word he and his family begin living under threat of attack and they are finally forced to flee the country the last scene gut wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters br br as one of two movies along with a world apart that helped galvanize the anti apartheid movement cry freedom stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved
<START> i read in the papers that w snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like the contractor he is just the next action star to join a growing club the penniless action stars of the 90s van damme segal lundgren snipes here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in bulgaria we are supposed to believe that the location is london like only a complete moron would buy that the story is the one of 1000 other movies retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job after that government wants to get rid of him good guy gets away after killing bad guys was that a spoiler guess not the star of the movie the little girl eliza bennett outperforms everybody else of the cast one star is for her plus one star for eye candy lena headey makes 2 stars only for die hard snipes fans everybody else avoid
<START> someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film br br firstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993 the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80's my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world br br there is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loner's favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because he's an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even stupider br br the loner is the nostril picker i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that clears up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them that's more or less it br br the acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even typing this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded i'm not even going to describe it you'll know it when you hear it and you'll agree with me br br there are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute 'i've got the cash if you've got the gash' lovely i'm sure you'll agree br br utter nonsense
<START> its no surprise that busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity this film is also a poor decision but one i enjoyed fully the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film boring bad dialouge and then with a spiderman stance busey yells the best worst line in any film ever created your worst nightmare butthorn i coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard that line resonates so well it even tops clooney's infamous hi freeze i'm batman line other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex cia partner killed which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest all made possible by a super slow motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting there's an ashtray to the nads punches to the face and a that wasn't my fault and you know it well the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy so other scream out loud moments has to be his ex girl friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape a plan that defies all logic physics and absurdity and lastly when mcbain jumps out of the thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object i almost wet myself some of busey's best work by far rent or buy it today butthorn my vote is a perfect 10 on the poo meter that is
