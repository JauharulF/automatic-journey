<START> i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goings on the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie the dialogues are much better than those in the umrao jaan ada a supposedly dialogue based movie the background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie it somehow remind me of vv chopra's kareeb in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department looks or acting the supporting cast are too good i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badly br br it had no double entendres sivan category no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic the movie is only about prem poonam rest of the characters are incidental art immitating life the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair br br coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part the situation of tragedy was artificially created the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all that is why it lacks the emotional punch the very purpose of this turn of events but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre marital video to a 'feature film' but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard may be this will help the movie a tax free status but the plot could have been made more interesting and non linear than what it was br br there were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended 2 has the movie ended
<START> this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater although he is my favorite when i heard he was going to play a hit man i was a little stunned thinking can mr hanks pull this one off and he did in high fashion this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty redemption and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan being the family man and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue which he delivers a knockout performance br br on one night of one of his jobs michael's son michael jr played by newcomer tyler hoechlin witnesses the hit and michael sr 's partner in crime fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr except michael jr so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney son of paul newman's mr rooney br br the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right even though son is along for the ride while on this deadly journey someone has hired a hit for michael sr the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire played by a stain teethed jude law br br the movie will have you feeling the old days and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes so sit back and enjoy the wild ride
<START> well i'll start with the good points the movie was only 86 minutes long and some of it was so bad it was funny now for the low points my first warning sign came with an actual warning on the film when it started the following warning was displayed the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun pretty or romantic i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then the first words of the film were i'm at the glue factory it was some guy talking on his phone and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory i don't know why so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script that's what is looked like they were doing the script was horrible and the big twist was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes without any more painful details of the plot here were some horrible highlights of the movie they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an army of one because soldiers are really just murderers then they tried to make an attempt at satanic worship by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting the great computer hacker was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address i'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages com there was also a random allusion to 9 11 for no reason i also learned that no matter where you get shot blood will come out of your mouth within seconds br br so if you like really bad acting sub par scripts bad camera work and an obvious plot you'll love zodiac killer
<START> if you are already a fan of peter o'donnell's wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties you will really enjoy this movie if you have ever seen the 1966 modesty blaise film forget it that was camp this is the real modesty blaise the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love it's a long way from joe losey's 1966 travesty and it takes our modesty quite seriously alexandra staden is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt chuckle br br this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty her childhood and her days with lob br br since peter o'donnell was the creative consultant on the movie everything really rings true even the story o'donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it having read all the books i enjoyed the movie even more for that br br now that miramax has kept their option on the property by having quentin tarrentino make this film i do hope to see more of the modesty stories asap especially as the wonderful character of willie garvin makes modesty's character really come alive to that end i really hope the film does well in europe i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution i wonder how miramax decides where and how to distribute it's films br br in the story modesty is in her early 20's working at louche's casino in tangier the flashback sequences are artfully done and take modesty from about 9 years old through her teens up to her current age in the movie about 21 22 i'd guess i really don't think there's a perfect actress for modesty for many of us modesty fans she's much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already alexandra staden is credible she is very slim graceful and poised she has lots of closeups she has a great face one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over according to o' donnell's illustrator romero modesty has rather a fuller figure than staden but i'm willing to overlook that if staden continues in the role i think she will mature into it just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older staden already conveys modesty's humor and absolute assurance very well go ahead and rent this movie it's not like anything else you've seen and even though it was directed by scott spiegel it is full of tarrentino touches great camera moves lighting and well done action sequences
<START> way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasn't close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing as if you would've had to try what the hell was this writer director thinking here's one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent's house i think jacobson was actually trying to present or invent 'the soft side' of j dahmer
<START> in holland a gay writer gerard jeroen krabbe gives a lecture he stays overnight with a beautiful woman christine renee soutendijk and has sex with her by imagining she's a boy he plans to leave the next day but gets a look at a picture of christine's hunky boyfriend herman thom hoffman and decides to stay to have a try at him then things get strange br br a big x rated art house hit in the us in 1983 why was it x rated let's see there's strangulation full frontal male and female nudity castration mutilation simulated sex a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people a gay sex scene in a crypt and it's all a comedy paul verhoeven made this after spetters spetters was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash so verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it he was right critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them still it's a great film br br it's beautifully shot by jan de bont now a director himself and there's so much symbolism and obvious hidden layers in the dialogue that you're never bored all the acting is great krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but somehow has you rooting for him soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection the little smile she gives when gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with krabbe in the crypt br br this is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you like me this is for you a 10 all the way
<START> this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer stupid script bad casting endless boredom br br in the usual tradition of hollywood the government of the us is shown as always evil the communist sympathizer nitwits in hollywood most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain br br oh yeah and the us brought over all those evil nazis like werner vonbraun without whom we would have no space program he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country br br and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want and yet this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this
<START> this is what i wrote to some friends earlier br br holy crap the grudge is honest to god one of the scariest films i've ever seen i am either getting very soft in my old age or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a job can't wait for boogeyman br br i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone anyone sitting next to me except the protagonist in grudge i saw the movie by myself i swear there were many many jump scenes that were not expected i felt foolish but my nerves did not care i was on edge the entire movie from the opening credits and the music was fantastically scary i keep thinking of that sound though and i do not like it br br i actually gasped aloud a few times and cried oh at one scene oh yeah i even half covered my eyes a few times word to the wise though i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho but i don't remember the movie so can't compare br br i can't say i enjoyed this movie b c i was terrified but it was very very good and scary the ending scene too whoa for being a 32 year old mommy i think i may have nightmares from this movie especially because of that sound please get out of my head br br in summary this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with jason freddy this is a most of the time spooky movie perfect for halloween br br two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2

<START> now i don't hate cheap movies i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv tapes br br maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn't maybe i hate it because it's cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom savini can't save this br br seriously this one is a complete waste of time
<START> this film is one of michael keaton's best throughout the film he is 'on' with co stars like ms henner joe piscopo and danny devito you can't go wrong great laughs great fun for everyone
<START> this is a baffling film br br the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits br br greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini's film 8 1 2 but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema greenaway is not br br he has none of the maestro's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity br br he is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored br br as for the women only two can be described as lookers palmira played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal the rest ooze with ordinariness both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy br br greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction br br there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant br br the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child she in fact gets pregnant twice the first foetus being aborted and the second time she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book both men having sex with a woman who has no legs the half woman in the title the beastiality that exists between beryl played by amanda plummer with a pig named hortense father and son sharing women between them women enjoying being beaten sexually the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife br br mercifully none of these scenes are shown sexually only hinted at br br the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men br br greenaway's directorial style is pretentious it is a triumph of style over substance a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense br br greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships
<START> the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film balta street in budapest but it could really be in any place the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner the film is not about budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love reflected in most of the main characters br br alfred kralik and klara novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully hugo matuschek the owner of the shop is having trouble with his wife she only a voice at the end of the phone ferencz vadas has a secret affair ilona novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments mr pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children pepi katona 'plays santa claus' to a girl at christmas you even sense that quiet flora katchuck while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone br br the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama it moves effortlessly from scene to scene it is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again simple yet profound the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days br br all the acting is magnificent even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect james stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other perfectly he was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance margaret sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days some of her other films are worth catching as mr matuschek frank morgan is amazing his moment of truth is very moving gold stars all round to the performers br br it is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to the vague re make 'you've got mail' was dire but in this case it is true the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit charm and warm humanity
<START> i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again i wonder why i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the confessions films but about a third of the way through whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me lai the film asks us to start taking it seriously not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted in short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend richard o'sullivan maybe as such a central figure could have helped but i reckon this to be one of his worst performances just worth it for the ladies
<START> neil simon's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semi retired vaudevillians here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as al br br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie willie is pathological on the subject of al first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie can't remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial br br ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al's neck br br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the one liners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example chest pains i'm getting chest pains uncle willie every thursday i come here and get chest pains so come on fridays benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself but in actuality matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not senile he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement br br i call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the irascible willie admits that al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny man br br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly dale of the team smith and dale jack benny was benny probably would have done a good job but ill health forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan
<START> if it wasn't for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments one in particular is where the afghan police soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away still filming presumably to his plush hotel then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion br br i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has 5 8 10 i thought imdb users had more sense
<START> nothing happens br br then characters with no personality don't develop br br then the end never comes because there's no beginning and no middle br br there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be because this movie isn't even there there's no is in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point there's nothing br br there is a good point it has a good soundtrack but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time so if you're really interested i'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something you'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue headache and impatience br br polarisdib
<START> one star that's all this documentary deserves i haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time br br i'm a big fan of the walking with series including it's nigel marvin spin offs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other docs from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places br br well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lol br br though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects and overused mtv style camera effects br br speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man in suit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions br br the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesn't even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the ornithochirus sp that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it it's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding it br br the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the bbc version i saw and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which i did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with docs br br and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm
<START> well sorry for the mistake on the one line summary run people run this movie is an horror imagine gary busey in another low budget movie with an incredibly bad scenario isn't that a nightmare no well yes it is plato's run i give it out of
<START> a study in bad bad acting bad music bad screenplay bad editing bad direction and a bad idea pieces of schlock don't come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this thing by the end of the movie you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place poor malcolm mcdowell was he short of cash or something still thinking of seeing this spoilers ahoy if you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes by the time you'll see the cyborg populated town named cytown you will avoid this my movie loving friends avoid
