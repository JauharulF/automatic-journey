<START> if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the lakers t shirt do not dismiss this film as trash
<START> i love new york is another entry by vh 1 mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ebonics speaking craziest contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true it's not as bad as it's previous show flavor of love but it's just as bad br br it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show in living color where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on the love connection dating show and he picked robin givens for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in this show reminds me of that br br the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why bother br br it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you can't hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the wwf any way you slice it it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil br br no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately
<START> i've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on dvd without reading any reviews about it so after 15 minutes of watching i've noticed that something is wrong with this movie it's terrible i mean in the trailers it looked scary and serious br br i think that eli roth mr director thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funny so stupid it's funny wrong he should watch and learn from better horror comedies such as fright night the lost boys and the return of the living dead those are funny br br cabin fever is the reason why i registered to www imdb com so i can release my thoughts of discontent about it br br i've decided to watch the movie a second time aaargh and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is resident evil horror or dude where's my car comedy i can watch over and over again and still enjoy but this br br how bad can a script and a director be this bad here are the awful scenes in chronological order br br in the early scenes we see henry who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead glazed stare is dead br br the movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long haired kid who like to bite people br br and my answer to marcy's unanswered question what's wrong with the woods is nothing the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense br br then the smartest of the 5 pack bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire he meets now infected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the f word bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill bert don't make me shoot you he forgets to add with my bb gun br br bert heads back to the cabin but how about that he meets marcy and jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier a moment of clarity for a change bert doesn't mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his bb gun br br later as the five estupidos sit around their campfire another weirdo shows up with his dog maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about it's filled with weirdos and their dogs they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis their brains are completely intoxicated no wonder why they are all so dumb this is the last time we'll see this forgettable character alive br br henry shows up at their cabin note he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo he says he needs a doctor but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard seats and windows the fantastic five come out running armed with a bb gun a knife a baseball bat huh ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods a poker and a insecticide spray can ready to combat the single unarmed and terribly sick man clever script bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth what else am i supposed to do bert yells in his defense jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead henry walks up to the dumb girls who say he's coming towards us thanks for the info dumb broads i can see that but i don't think he wants to do you any harm marcy sprays in his eyes making henry yelp and our hero paul touches henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin where has all that wisdom gone i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll henry turns into the human torch and runs away screaming br br the following day bert and jeff head out for a mechanic and marcy decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as paul stays behind with karen doesn't that sound idiotic marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already going for help br br i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river how did she get a canoe does she even know where she's going anyway she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin saying hello is anyone there bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first and along comes jeff as well how did they get here did they swim across the river do you see how brainless the script is br br deputy winston meets paul at the cabin he somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck this happens around 35 minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out before i take my own eyes out now that's funny br br if you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch fright night the lost boys or the return of the living dead then you'll see they are more entertaining than this thing even the toxic avenger part 2 which is also a lousy film is way more funnier than cabin fever
<START> interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms in other words the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal dolph lundgren sam decker plays the soldier school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field however the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb try to enjoy it if you decided to view it
<START> when deathtrap was first released the poster reproduced on the cover of this dvd offered a graphic akin to a rubik's cube it is an appropriate image originally written for the stage by ira levin who authored such memorable works as rosemary's baby and the stepford wives the play was one of broadway's most famous twisters and under sidney lumet's direction it translates to the screen extremely well br br deathtrap is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous but the opening premise is extremely clever sidney bruhl michael caine is the famous author of mystery plays but these days he seems to have lost his touch after a particularly brutal opening night an old student named clifford anderson christopher reeve sends him a script for a play he has written it is called deathtrap and sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit just the sort of hit that would revive his career indeed a hit to die for and when clifford visits to discuss the play events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible br br like anthony shaffer's equally twisty sleuth deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers still under the expert guidance of director sidney lumet it makes a more than respectable showing on the screen much of this is due to the cast which is remarkably fine michael caine gives a truly brilliant performance dyan cannon is funny and endearing as sidney's relentlessly anxious wife and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career if you can't see it in a first rate theatrical production this will more than do until one comes along br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> if you go to this movie expecting something it isn't you will be disappointed as with any movie this movie contains what hemmingway described as the iceberg effect on the surface its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie if this would be written in a book it would be a short story because the action in the movie is very fast paced and unless you actually try to catch it the reasoning behind the plot along with some subtle foreshadowing can very well pass you by definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate experimental cinematography barely describes this movie the camera work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others something to be desired in american movies as of late although at some parts it may get a little raunchy gruesome and too heavy for some audiences the movie never becomes completely unrealistic the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as needs improvement is the soundtrack selection no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack and although the soundtrack is quite fitting the opening is a little too long and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate heavy grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip the flooding of imagery and dynamic color palettes adds another artistic aspect to it also combined with the events that happen throughout the film this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand however that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch and not one you'll quickly get bored of 8 5 10
<START> it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the 'exclusive' studies shown who are the 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' that gathered this data what's up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone layer br br i've seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really don't understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless you've been living under a rock this 'documentary' shouldn't be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points p s i'm not american so don't even try saying that i'm a bush fan p
<START> a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins
<START> the word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation the combination of neil simon walter matthau possibly the world's best living comic actor and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns' part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in matthau's apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter definitely one of my desert island films br br enter
<START> this movie was in a sci fi 50 pack a friend of mine got me for christmas it is very similar to the first gozilla movie and like that movie has scenes with american actors inserted for no real reason one interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a cold war tension portrayed between america and russia like in godzilla gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world paying close attention to tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless tokyo bites it all in all this is an okay movie some of the scenes involving gamera particularly the scenes in toly are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time if you like japanese giant monster movies you'll really get a kick out of this one i give it a 4 out of 10 had this been the unedited japanese version that i watched it probably would've gotten a 5
<START> probably minor spoilers br br i cant say i liked it but i cant say i didn't its very strange it has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst cgi you can imagine if i was the director i would cut that part for sure gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie for some people it will be boring cause it lacks action feels home made sometimes take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what nop not crying their telling horror stories to each other sighs just after crying for hes lost br br another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like hundreds of candles in the table in front of them the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains old rags covering the windows and sofas couches i thought it was dumb using candles but not thinking about the surroundings besides being in high sea alone br br the good some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of so this movie does it good maybe because its a low budget i don't know but it works fine for me you will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned above br br do not expect much of it but if you like anykind of movie watch this one be patient try to enjoy lol br br sorry about my raw english br br cheers
<START> this film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years it is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me shivers not even pasoliniÂ´s sÃ¡lo to which this film bears comparison affected me like that i saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like pasolini fassbinder and others i had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like i did i think the answer would be that i was watching a horror film but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the margins of civilized society abandoned houses deserted hotels castles churchyards morgues etc this handling of the subject in horror is i think a sort of defence mechanism a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer so from this perspective hundstage is not a horror film it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so doesnÂ´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film but what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its violation the stages of fright and torture it can be put through what seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression loneliness lack and violation of intimacy and integrity precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape it is precisely within this displacement that the power of seidlÂ´s film resides hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in quotidian repetition rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis a move you would encounter in said horror genre one important point of reference here is rainer werner fassbinder fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism domination desire questions concerning ownership sexual property and control fascism and capitalism etc seidlÂ´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with fassbinder like this german ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films during a seminar at the gothenburg film festival this year at which seidl was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated subjugated women in hundstage but no instances of a woman fighting back liberating herself seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it an artistic statement as good as any i think thank you
<START> i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all time classic i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock stock and snatch but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed i absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films and also a lot better i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie i believe he has taken movie making to another level i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film but i believe time will prove me right this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film some answers from endless hours of thinking some answers from reading other people's take on the film and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been
<START> there aren't many overcoming the odds stories quite like that of christy brown born with cerebral palsy in 1930s dublin his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical though eventually properly diagnosed brown in a lower working class family with nearly 20 children had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family through the use of his only fully functioning limb his left leg he taught himself to write and paint both skills he developed expertly br br but what makes the film version of brown's autobiography my left foot such a great retelling is its humility both director writer jim sheridan and star daniel day lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous yet my left foot stays real and intrinsically inspired br br day lewis is the easiest to highlight playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task not only does day lewis give us a very complete picture of christy but he also manages to chronicle the growth improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life he plays christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non platonic love the latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for sheridan and co adapter shane connaughton to really flesh that out regardless day lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements giving a performance that's so believable you often don't have time to think wow he's such a great actor those are the most commendable performances br br equally important but through more subtle means is sheridan's work on the film this story is about day to day life and struggles although christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life his struggles are not unlike our own and sheridan grasps that concept completely christy struggles with love parental attention questions of self worth and capability his struggles are just more physically manifested literally and figuratively than ours br br sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large brown family and christy's unique place in it the drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way the dinner scene when christy learns that his doctor teacher the woman he loves is going to marry his brother peter is the film's finest example of both day lewis and sheridan's efforts it's built up to so well by sheridan that it comes out when we're ready and day lewis takes us from there with his stunning work br br the other strong component of the film is brenda fricker as mrs brown i did not know she'd won the oscar but there was something about her performances as christy's loving and wise mother that just screamed oscar worthy her love for christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation br br the emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human the two should be reconcilable but i imagine it's challenging to tell a story that feels true to life and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster the choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for my left foot brown's circumstances speak for themselves they don't need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impact br br steven c br br visit my site moviemusereviews com for more
<START> as a lover of bad movies i definitely hit paydirt with this one the plot isn't really that bad but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here br br there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever first off rudy ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time there are also scenes where there is a slow motion instant replay jumping onto a ten foot high wall by playing falling off of it backwards naked men walking out of huge letters and sex that literally brings down the roof with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire br br of course no rudy ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where rudy makes fun of all the customers interposed with people doing some odd dance there are so many things bad about this movie but they're bad in an entertaining way and if you take your eyes off the movie you might miss another mistake br br rating 1 10 for actual value 10 10 for cheese factor 10 10 for picking out mistakes and goofs averages out to 7 10
<START> i watched shore leave the other day i've seen it so many times and i never get tired of it strangely enough every time i watch it lately it takes me right back to the very first time i saw it including this time must be that sense of mystery and what is going on here about it br br oddly enough the one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me this time actually had a huge effect on me ruth i think a lot of it was gerald fried's score a real masterpiece that the romantic section was reused much more extensively in this side of paradise but of course it debuted here i get the impression that out of all the girls kirk knew over the years she may have been the sweetest when she said do you have to go combined with the music i could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her br br someone commented online that ruth looked older than he was yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years which makes me think maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy kirk had an affair with an older woman perhaps he thought back to this in miri when he told janice i never get involved with older women maybe he meant anymore br br reading st reviews the other day i see where someone compared what are little girls made of with i mudd but it seems shore leave oughta be in there too what are all those people if not androids and could the caretaker be related to the old ones from the earlier episode whoever he is he seems to be one of the rare cases in st where you have a race that is actually superior as opposed to merely thinking they are br br yeoman barrows seems to be filling in for yeoman rand considering how much attention dr mccoy showered on her it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again sheesh br br one thing missing from the last several i've watched that snuck back in here was spock smiling he was i saw him i really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time rather than this submerged business when he said enjoy yourself sir near the beginning you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer but talking to his friend and at the end when he needlessly says totally illogical i can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction he may not be smiling or laughing but i think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy
<START> i haven't seen the original incredible journey since i was a child so i can't really compare the two versions this version tells the story of three animals two dogs and a cat whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco the pets believing that they have been abandoned escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness br br this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon but both versions are in fact live action films made using real animals one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices giving each its own distinct personality something that was not done in the original film a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as racing stripes some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it the animals were voiced by big name stars don ameche michael j fox and sally fields br br both dogs are male and their relationship parallels that between many humans in buddy buddy movies shadow a golden retriever is the wise experienced older dog chance the younger one is brash cocky and impulsive to british eyes chance looks like a boxer but is actually an american bulldog which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality she is very proud of her status as a cat which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog cats rule dogs drool br br from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults it can be sentimental some of the incidents such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river are quite incredible and the human characters are all completely forgettable this however is a film which is mainly aimed at children and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely certainly any animal loving child will do so comments by some professional critics such as james berardinelli who complained that the animals' voices lessened the film's grandeur only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children's movies i doubt if many playground conversations about homeward bound concentrated on its supposed grandeur br br one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of california's sierra nevada mountains they may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness this is a very enjoyable family film 7 10
<START> me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty they were such a cute couple the ending was so sad love this movie although it is a little dirty it reminds of a british or irish version of prime if you liked this movie you should watch prime same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed don't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me umm if you like irish movies i would recommend circle of friends that movie is so good quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined lol
<START> this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying it's quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re runs br br most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads br br i haven't commented enough you've got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show br br the gnome was a nice character
<START> this is a very very early bugs bunny cartoon as a result the character is still in a transition period he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right in addition the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual elmer is some poor sap who buys bugs from a pet shop there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations in later films he messed with elmer yosimite sam and others because they started it they messed with the rabbit but in this film he is much more like daffy duck of the late 30s and early 40s a jerk who just loves irritating others a true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons while this isn't among the best bug bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years
