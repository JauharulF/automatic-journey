<START> kevin spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much i admire spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts i found the film dull boring and stretched out the acting was nothing spectacular gary sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films skeet ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck however that shot was very usual suspects ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch hitchcock's lifeboat maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this
<START> this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen br br the plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time worst of all is steve guttenberg he plays his character like he was in police academy the same foolish womanizer and that's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller br br it's really hard to believe that hanson would make l a confidential ten years later br br avoid this like the plague
<START> there are two movie experiences i will always cherish the first was seeing star wars for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend trevor in late october 1978 halloween left me breathless speechless and downright scared everyone knows the story young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963 he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again he spots laurie jamie lee curtis a shy senior who enjoys babysitting and begins stalking her her partying friends across the street are killed one by one as michael sets his plot to get her ironically the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the boogeman and can see him outside during the murder spree dr sam loomis donald pleasance works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury he has no proof no evidence just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket charles cyphers as the plot unfolds you have a suspense driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare alfred hitchcock once said you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off that is a cheap thrill however put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it then it doesn't go off then you have suspense director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween the audience will see glimpses of him outside watching stalking his victims we gasp will he kill her when will he kill her then michael disappears carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore this movie has little blood but still provides good scares one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight then he drives it all you hear is a loud thud then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer this also peaks our audience what will he do what's going on inside his mind finally carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension moreover the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about the teens are not party mad but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland finally there is some decent acting in this b low budget thriller nick castle who plays the shape michael adds something to the mindless killer it is cold merciless and without any pathology moreover the personality does everything the same way he kills only when trapped or to set up a trap he splits the victims apart he also relies on brute strength and that mask used a bleached william shatner mask gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues he comes across as someone scared desperate and determined it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil the crown jewel though is jamie lee curtis' debut she plays the laurie character as someone scared but also determined and strong who fights back the end is one that left me speechless this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times halloween and other scary movies though do not have that advantage so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new halloween would be the movie i would choose
<START> an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie
<START> in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jess's brother here is my response br br the role of jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig sheffer norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess's brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when jess's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
<START> this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down br br i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable br br who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying br br i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money
<START> this was the most costly film when produced sir alexander korda and h g wells were both distressed by its poor ratings for good reason it was and remains far ahead of its time aside from the seemingly poor direction probably editing at the very beginning the work moves along to a stunning conclusion br br whether its sir ralph richardson's 'boss' role or even better his wife's sir cedric's as adversary to space faring raymond massey's 'john cabal' center role all deliver mind boggling performances br br the scene with mr korda's incomparable set of the small girl child running out to an absolutely 'never to be matched' scene commenting 'life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier' that swiftly brings tears to any parent grandparent this is not a film for the young unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen 'the horror' it opposes br br sure the 'phony parachuting' looks hokey while using a 'magnetic cannon' now termed 'mass driver' may be viewed as ridiculous vs rockets give sir korda a break mr wells made that choice and at 8 million this film went way beyond 'over budget' so he concentrated on what he could manage br br the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in 'john cabal's' final statement of human destiny his friend 'passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space faring saying 'we're such little animals ' john cabal's proper response is paraphrased 'yes little animals and if that is all we are we must live and die as such ' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope he sweeps his hand over the night sky 'yet we may have all the universe or nothing ' then the final chorus breaks in 'which shall it be ' this is not 'star wars' 'blade runner' anything you may consider 'great' this is the real thing br br i remind all of steven hawking's most recent address upon his latest 'medal of honor' 'humanity must leave earth or die ' the very core of this work i love 'standard entertainment' yet this 'relic' for the wise viewer offers far more 'which shall it be ' be in the proper 'mood' whatever that takes this will take your breath away i 'guarontee' overall for humanity the most significant of cinema br br since posting i note many have commented on the poor 'media quality' of 'surviving' examples in the 80's i developed a 'proprietary' 'colorization' process which required a 'clean' original this led me to michael korda who sadly noted all were gone so we must relish what remains 'sad but true '
<START> the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene the 'twist' in those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty the way slashers should be edge to it the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore
<START> pegg has had a few hits in the past few years starting with shaun of the dead in 2004 movie on to hot fuzz 2007 early 2008 he came out with run fat boy run and now comes this how to lose friends and alienate people which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy's of the year br br the film is about sidney yound a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity's mostly because he is not one of them anyway one of the most successful magazine owners played by jeff bridges invites him out of nostalgia to work at his magazine sidney is of course excited and moves to america there he meets a girl currently writing a book and hilarity ensues br br this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy paul i rate this film 81
<START> i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract br br she decided to take the money but her career suffered accordingly br br that might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway though it doesn't explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and that's right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next part br br also the sets and costumes looked like b movie stuff and her hair turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and you'll be doing yourself a favor
<START> i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf 1999 it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci fi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters
<START> the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe i'd recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
<START> is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story maybe hell you know how the formula works by now pretty woman is introduced in to a picture someone has to fall in love with her br br i think this film does follow some typical story lines but that doesn't say anything about the content there are great scenes with crispen glover dennis hopper and gary busey although short some things didn't make sense such as the need to get in to random fights but it is entertaining to watch the fights were actually well done br br this is definitely a comedy foremost but it does have a lot of good feel to it the humor is well balanced you won't hurt your stomach on this but you will keep a smile br br there is a little bit of steamy action so not one for the kids
<START> i saw this film premiere friday 1 19 night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved sitting in a theater and hearing first hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us robert acosta paul rieckhoff sean huze and herold noel all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film were present while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be whether you support the war or not it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker see this film
<START> for getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me it is slow moving and long at times the story is not clear particularly in the evolving relationships among characters my advice read the book it's a fabulous story which loses it's impact on screen
<START> i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable judge for yourself be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie br br a computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors when the code in the form of light enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk br br this virus is very intelligent when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device operated by hands the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water br br oh dear
<START> i'm just quite disappointed with soul survivors it doesn't worth even a comment in this forum the script is very poor as well as all the acting and for our entertainment it features a pointless plot br br please do yourselves a favor be a real survivor don't waste your time in this piece of crap someday you'll thank me
<START> i stumbled on this late last night n tcm br br hadn't seen it since it came out originally but had never forgotten it br br i had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented signe hasso was when she was still young ditto for shelly winters before she balooned out br br ronald coleman though was the quintessential state actor of his time i had read othello in high school english and hated it after seeing a double life i read it again and finally understood what the play was about br br the gordon kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was done br br a movie well worth remembering and rewatching
<START> this movie is awful i don't even know where to begin i'm speechless i can't even describe how awful this is the blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was rediculous i don't see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad it looks like it was made by highschool students
<START> this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall in nebraska i wonder if the real town's name was close to blainsworth which is the town's name in the movie there is an ainsworth nebraska but there is also a town that starts with blains something br br it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house on the other hand the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact before doppler radar and weather radio we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not on cable and tuned the brightness just right you could tell if there was a tornado coming the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it br br since i know something about midwest tornadoes it made this movie fun for me i enjoy it more than twister i mean give me a break there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house
