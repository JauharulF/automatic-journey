<START> a film i expected very little from and only watched to pass a quiet hour but what an hour it turned out to be roll is an excellent if none too serious little story of 'country boy lost in the big city makes good' it is funny throughout the characters are endearing and the pace is just right br br toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny watch out for these two br br highly recommended
<START> this film moved me beyond comprehension it is and will remain my favourite film of all time mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film i have to put it into my dvd player so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says but your own words ask for direct confrontation isn't that a direct call for violence biko replies well you and i are in confrontation now but i see no violence br br craig robertson fife scotland
<START> director kevin connor and wannabe action hero romantic lead doug mcclure re team in this ghost story set in japan they had been moderately successful together in the 1970's with the likes of 'the land that time forgot' 1975 'at the earth's core' 1976 etc without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way br br the film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted laura visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place br br no surprises as to what happens next with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex mcclure assuming the role of the wife's lover br br everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant to an inevitable but surprisingly downbeat conclusion main points of interest are two feeble decapitations 'the omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set piece and the love making scenes featuring the doe eyed but extremely kinky susan george the first is a long 'don't look now' inspired piece with her hubby complete with piano music the second a much shorter probably at her insistence entanglement with mcclure both looking pretty uncomfortable anyway every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost br br overall i can't decide whether 'the house where evil dwells' is rubbish watchable rubbish or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way if you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort br br best scene in any other film the big black tree climbing japanese muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is to be told beef and vegetable before uttering the immortal line ugh there's an awful face in my soup if this wasn't enough the reply is c'mon eat your soup for daddy laurel hardy rest in piece
<START> the main problem with power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever it gets boring after awhile sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward you could probably pass it all off as character development but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie or are just simply to flat and uninteresting lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom he should have cut a few of the characters hackman the wife and concentrated harder on others billings it could have been a great hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting a fact that amazed me considering the cast even gene hackman performance wasn't up to par denzel washington is the only real actor of note here gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere br br sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies i e serpico and stop trying to recapture his success with 12 angry men and fail safe it hasn't worked yet sidney and it most likely never will leave the ensemble dramas to altman br br 3 10 br br
<START> this is not a very good movie but it's not a stinker either it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk br br my gf and i have figured this movie out we think so here it is br br major spoilers below br br firstly this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious dream state junk 95 of the movie br br ignoring the junk what really happened is this a group of school friends go to a rave one night they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die that's the simple cut down version that's right i said sean bear with me br br right after the accident cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life death right up until the very end of the movie this is where the dream part starts br br the movie is called soul survivors right cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls annie matt raven the 2 weirdos and jude along with images conjured up by her mind sean school and everything else around her the souls continue doing what they were defined as annie the rave going chick the 2 weirdo killers from opening scene father jude still helping people etc br br we are then taken on a very long ride shown lots of images many of which my gf and i still can't tie in but it all boils down to it not being cassie's time to die br br at the end cassie wakes up in the hospital after being dead for a while her family and sean are there this is reality again she's ok br br then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled but this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up beside sean obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience br br due to space restrictions we didn't cover every little thing but feel free to drop us an e mail if you want to br br
<START> yes you guessed it another movie where identical twins switch places i think now that the olsen twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re runs of 'full house' if you plan on seeing this film don't watch 'the parent trap' instead it's more entertaining
<START> having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience i have to say that while i agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable see mulholland drive they still have to engage you with the characters now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's opus i have to say i couldn't give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world br br also while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it i would have to disagree i didn't enjoy because i was bored i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help call it clever if you will i think it's repetitious br br however my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw just music over black did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr's pretentiousness or did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed
<START> running man isn't a great movie in fact it's kinda silly but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture it's so silly and over the top that it almost makes fun of itself by the way this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there
<START> the movie opens with a beautiful lady in a tattered white gown running through a stereotypical eastern european town we know she's being followed by something because she keeps looking behind her and soon we see she's being chased by a mysterious man in a black trenchcoat then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her but look is that her reflection in the store window no its just her identical twin vampire but unfortunately they both get it br br after this brilliant and amazingly fun throwback to the old hammer films of the 60's and 70's in the credits the twins are listed as the twins of evil which of course is the name of the final instalment in hammer's karnstein trilogy the plot pretty much dies br br what little plot there is involves dracula who conveniently changes his appearance each time he is reborn so the producer doesn't have to rehire the same dracula coming to a morgue the med students realizing he's undead and thinking wow what an opportunity maybe i'll just disregard all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use the vampire's blood to find a cure for our jerk friend's ailment obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire br br a new concept but pulled off excruciatingly badly the movie keeps setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them br br for example the med students attempt to bring drac back to life by placing him in a bathtub filled with blood in a secluded run down country mansion the house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film but do we stay there no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool sigh this movie has a real problem with homages as i mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of hammer and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer like movie but the movie rapidly switches gears and changes to a medical horror br br the other problem is that they introduce so many characters it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them there are the med students and their wheelchair bound professor type friend the med students are all arrogant boring money hungry and stupid how they made it to med school at all amazes me unless the med school had to meet its muscle bound hunk big breast quota and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie hey i can respect that but it would be nice if they didn't set it up like the movie would be about him then you have random priests cops and science types so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that it becomes quickly tedious br br basically this is a lazy movie no real scares just a few predictable jump scares the set up for these is so elaborate it is hilarious for examp le the bathtub full of blood it is so obvious that drac is going to pop out of the murky blood and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable jump scare after this he kills one of the dumber and larger breasted med students we all know she's going to become one of the undead but what do the others do bury her in a shallow grave near the house sigh so you know who will jump out at you when the cops show up at the house br br oh well br br maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric and then we will end up with an entire movie that is as good as the opening scene br br
<START> this film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldn't work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived however if you are the sort person like me who adores older hollywood films you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is an interesting soap br br the film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies in this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth but doctors are concerned about possible complications yikes such a room would really traumatize the mothers and like an episode of love boat or fantasy island each mother has her own special story with so many rather extreme and crazy stories you have to suspend disbelief i could and enjoyed the film quite a bit br br here are a few of the stories one involves a father you don't see the mom but he is a very very nervous father and it's included for comic relief however he was wonderful here very touching br br loretta young and eric linden are a sad case loretta is sent to the hospital from prison she apparently killed some horrible guy you don't know exactly what occurred but you assume he was trying to force himself on her yet she was given a 20 year sentence and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he can br br glenda farrell is an awful person she has the maternal instincts of a hamster a really really bad and alcoholic hamster she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she can't make money selling her twins late in the film she has a typical hollywood style change of heart that was supposed to be touching i found it contrived br br there is a woman who has given birth to a still born baby amazingly afterwords they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth a crazy woman who you assumed lost a baby some time ago wanders down from the psychiatric unit she insists she's having a baby later she escapes again and actually takes one of the kids br br there are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones as i said it's a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining and quite sad in the case of several of the stories the ending in particular is heart breaking and exceptionally well done there were a few particularly good performances especially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse all in all a very good film and i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later which was typical for warner brothers
<START> i expected a comedy like the big mama movies instead the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy drama and a love story br br this movie has three plots the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father br br there is actually very little comedy in the movie there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie for example madea beats the foster child with a belt in a comedic manner to convince the child to straighten out the child does in fact turn herself around apparently it pays to beat children br br there are plots dealing with child rape with the consent of the mother there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them the ogling takes place at a family reunion the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off balance is this a comedy a love story or a drama it is in fact nothing except a waste of time and money
<START> a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> a great story based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road being that this is denzel washington's first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct i have to admit i was a tad sceptical but who wouldn't be but then again he's a great actor with plently of years of experience and the end result turned out great the story is told in a great way making you that has had difficulties during your childhood and young adulthood see yourself in those situations so it hits you hard letting you know your not the only one going through hell in all a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f ed up world the story is based on the life of antwone fisher born 3 august 1959 cleveland ohio usa whom was also the writer of this movie strongly recommended 8 10
<START> you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot br br and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into 'yet again' which on its own would be depressing but here it's overkill the idea that it's not a medical condition not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug some doppelgangers have super powers but others don't or don't know they do it seems they're just as clueless as we are br br it's a poor man's rip off of invasion of the body snatchers with keifer sutherland's mirror and the sixth sense were you to seriously botch those three together
<START> i saw this on a cantonese vcd with the english subtitles i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over acting this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score which really irked me throughout the entire movie if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few overacted scenes then the film would be much much better
<START> my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself it didn't br br i can't understand the praise given to this film the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time br br one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness like in happiness this was not that type of pause it was just simply bad directing this film might actually be much better with subtitles and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much br br i generally like these types of small quirky films the real blonde walking and talking lovely and amazing but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years
<START> to be honest i'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received the movie just drags along its 81 minute life span and the audience has to suffer the whole way through actually there are some positive moments in this film charlie spradling gives a decent performance she is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well scott valentine merrideth's boyfriend in family ties on the other hand is a pretty rough watch i guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger patterned chummies give me a break also valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see denice duff in bloodstorm subspecies 4 the movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by and to be honest charlie spradling's dance scenes this movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of charlie spradling which i am and i still had a rough time watching it
<START> a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and that's what's so good about the show it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller coaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile it's a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veoh com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops
<START> this was barbra streisand's first television special and is must see viewing for any streisand fan even non streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history performers like this only come our way once in a lifetime brilliant
<START> my comments for vivah its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneaked in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressing br br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of 2 families i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti i e amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid's bro sis in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome br br stuff like sanctity in a marriage relationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially praying sacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah there's still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arranged marriage thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006 hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita didn't get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way shudn't forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of srk kajol or aamir khan juhi chawla br br some points that i observed few of the elements 1 if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film perfect fit 2 shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but prem listens carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible 3 in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other 4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes songs are beautifully pictured words like jal praarthana e t c are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling br br in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshness on screen chemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewing business than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those time pass fuzzy style crap movies
