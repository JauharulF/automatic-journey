<START> i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original lifeboat i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody's fault really i mean i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lol it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 1 10
<START> the movie is boring the characters and scenarios are unrealistic unbelievable the action is hilarious this movie is a big mess it almost seems like when the action music kicks in the most impressive stunt is running either voice is dubbed over with mr mcgregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice there is way too much dialog in this movie and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf the movie is great sleep therapy the fighting is laughable the eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent the main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed the main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation he would just throw random plots in such as spoiler ctx his designer drug is going to be in the water supply which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie this movie is highly recommended to pass
<START> some years ago satellite channel u k gold promoted repeats of 'men behaving badly' with the hype here it is the original flat sharing sitcom this was in fact untrue 'man about the house' was also a flat sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 76 br br it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke creators of the popular sitcom 'father dear father' when it ended they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times br br in the first episode chrissy paula wilcox and jo sally thomsett are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath he is robin tripp richard o'sullivan a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode while his clothes dry out he puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay but there must be no naughty business so robin has to pretend to be gay br br on b b c 2's 'i love 1973' shown in 2000 julie burchill claimed that 'house' showed her a way of life she envied she was not alone one of the most iconic for me anyway images of '70's british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past br br a man living with two girls was a risquÃ© subject for the time but mrs mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar it was innocent good natured fun mortimer and cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it br br richard o'sullivan was still playing 'bingham' in i t v 's 'doctor in charge' when this got started in fact the second run of 'in charge' overlapped with the first of 'house' he was born to play the sex mad robin paula wilcox's 'chrissy' was more streetwise than 'beryl' her character she played in 'the lovers' while sally thomsett's 'jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde as time wore on he became almost like an older brother to them br br for many viewers brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers george had lost interest in sex but mildred had not they went on to their own show the aptly titled 'george mildred' the late doug fisher was good value as as robin's wideboy friend larry he worked so well he was made into a regular br br within a year of its debut there was the inevitable movie spin off i am not a big fan of the 'man about the house' movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen most of its characters had never appeared in the series br br the format was sold to america where it became the long running 'three's company' starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers it was far more suggestive than the british original with somers often seen in sexy clothing br br after six seasons 'house' ended with chrissy marrying robin's older brother norman norman eshley fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show 'robin's nest'
<START> now in india's sunny 'clime where i use to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her majesty the queen so goes the famous poem penned by rudyard kipling this is the literal foundation upon which the movie gunga din is based if you are fortunate enough to watch this legendary classic you will enjoy films the way they use to make them for the sheer pleasure taken from the script of the established novelist and poet this is a story of a humble indian native named gunga din sam jaffe who works as 'a regimental beasty' during the british occupation of india during the 18th century his greatest wish is to become a soldier the water boy is part of a british calvary contingent threatened with death by a notorious blood cult of kali called the 'thuggee ' three particular soldiers stand out in this company who are noted for their bravery and comradeship first is handsome and debonair cary grant playing sgt archibald cutter next is victor mclaglen as courageous sgt macchesney and finally there's flamboyant douglas fairbanks jr as sgt thomas ballantine all three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a hoard of mountain stranglers led by their fanatical leader called the 'guru' eduardo ciannelli amid the chaos of war is the brave water boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing a bugle he found a solid story for an old black and white film which needs little fanfare for anyone looking to enjoy a classic
<START> i'm a christian who generally believes in the theology taught in left behind that being said i think left behind is one of the worst films i've seen in some time br br to have a good movie you need to have a well written screenplay left behind fell woefully short on this for one thing it radically deviates from the book sometimes this is done to condense a 400 page novel down to a two hour film but in this film i saw changes that made no sense whatsoever br br another thing there is zero character development when characters in the story get saved i won't say who the book makes it clear that it's a long soul searching process in the film it's quick and artificial the book is written decently enough where people like rayford steele buck williams and hattie durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial in another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again i won't say who it seems artificial br br i realize as a christian it's unedifying for me to say i disliked this film but i can't in a good conscience recommend a film that i feel was horribly done perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2 3 films either way christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way i realize a lot of effort probably went into left behind but that's the way i see it
<START> i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don gallico a magician inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him br br although this movie doesn't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest br br this is a must for vincent price fans
<START> i can't think of much to say about this film br br this was an awful movie i can't even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to begin br br the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved br br the editing was poor the acting was sub par and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage br br if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasn't it was just pathetic
<START> i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers br br yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but it's also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boone's religious moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from today's standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
<START> br br i would highly recommend seeing this movie after viewing it you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying at least it wasn't the omega code br br forget my money i want my time back
<START> composed elegant carol marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke her nice husband eddie likable david houseman carol's wacky constantly eating best gal pal anna delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan and anna's hunky amorous husband pete a typically fine eric edwards are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other their usual routine gets disrupted when carol's lonely repressed but still alluring widow mother jennifer a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles drops by for a visit pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle with everyone except carol eager to seduce her writer director joe sarno concocts a sharp engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70's sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother daughter incest subplot moreover sarno elicits uniformly first rate acting from the bang up cast welles and brooke are both exceptional with excellent support from edwards jordan houseman arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs fields better still all the women are extremely hot and enticing welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit but never raunchy or tedious stephen colwell's bright polished cinematography and jack justis' bouncy melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective recommended viewing for sarno fans
<START> words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated nc 17 shunning away the only people that might tolerate it
<START> first of all i'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels mcbain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle it has all of the classic elements of a late 80's early 90's action film the random gratuitous acts of violence ie when walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money the snapping of necks the guys on fire the guys that get blown off buildings and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as let's go sit out on the deck and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst
<START> imagine the big chill with a cast of twenty somethings whose characters are all unlikable and an iguana like man lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein on the positive side the movie does not skimp on showing the monster there's no peek a boo shots or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like he's right out there folks unfortunately the design and construction aren't that inspired a little bit of mystery might have helped mind you i've seen far worse but if you're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick your monster better look damn good br br spoiler ahead br br oh and there's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script as for the acting well let's just say it wasn't painfully bad but i don't expect we'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings br br gore quotient 2 out of 5 nudity quotient 1 out of 5 intelligence quotient negligible
<START> i didn't think it could be done but something has come along and replaced open house a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate as the worst film i've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life br br it was touted as the best film in montreal's most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry br br watching this movie was like a little slice of hell it's from austria and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue velvet scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly there's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child the Ã¼ber annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists the list goes on forever much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatre br br yes the characters interact but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way i couldn't say if they were any good as actors as according to the subtitles they were given lines that were the austrian equivalent of you are so lame they certainly didn't have to learn many as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene br br this is no gummo or any of the aforementioned movies there is no art to discover and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your never walk out during a movie policy which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene and if that sounds appetizing it's not unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex and with a few local middle aged couples to boot revolting br br this movie was offensive to me not the flabby nudity not the cringe inducing soundtrack not the shockless scenes involving guns i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us montrealers could find most of all i was offended that somehow the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease br br
<START> how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather very very carefully now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously it's a joke people four legs good two legs bad as orwell had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic society's production of brigadoon would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley and the auld enemy where would the scots be without them to hate and blame for everything messrs roth cox and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison and at least alan rickman was funny
<START> this weekend just passed i watched 28 weeks later which was very good after that i watched this film br br i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch the scenes were unrealistic there was no script and no plot the alien creature was unreal and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film br br forget about this movie rather go and watch 28 weeks later br br cheers mesake c
<START> billy crystal co wrote co produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons adult irresponsibility and growing old billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack ha ha which causes him to seek out his estranged father alan king a movie extra who fancies himself a big star the script is sub neil simon nonsense with one liners galore a flat inexpressive direction by henry winkler stuck in sitcom mode and family conflict at the ready crystal and king try their best but king is over eager and frequently over the top jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles but manages to bring her innate down home class to the proverbial girlfriend character it's a comedy i guess but one that blinks back the tears shamefully from
<START> the film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with srk and aamir in lead roles br br the film finally was made now with vipul shah directing it and ajay and salman starring together after a decade hum dil de chuke sanam 1999 br br the movie however falls short due to it's 90's handling and worst it's loopholes br br the film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangle br br everything is predictable and filmy and too clichÃ©d br br there are loopholes like how ajay runs away from london airport and makes a place for himself with no one even the way he starts his band is not convincing the second half gets better with the twist in the tale of ajay destroying salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad note br br direction by vipul shah is ordinary to below average music is the worst point most songs are mediocre br br amongst actors ajay gives his best shot though he isn't convincing as a rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon asin is nothing great just a show piece ranvijay should stick to mtv om puri is okay
<START> with nothing better to do i decided to check out aztec rex as it was being billed for the hell of it br br the silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing they actually looked like animatics those rough designs that artists later use to finish the cgi effects adding more details smoother movements etc absolutely awful looking dinosaurs which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit through this anyway br br the one redeeming factor was the lovely dichen lachman as ayacoatl she kept my interest if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used br br disappointing at least the cast and crew got a free trip to hawaii where the movie was filmed
<START> this was a truly bad film the character cole played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil it didn't after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance this would have added some sincerity br br 1 badly acted 2 unsympathetic characters 3 razor thin plot line br br yuck br br
