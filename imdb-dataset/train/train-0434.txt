<START> i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap crap pardon the pun what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams blokes as well even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark
<START> man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list it's just got so many things working against it br br none of the actors cast are particularly good anna paquin as the lead character sookie is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i've seen her in so maybe it's just the writing she's not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof the other actors do their best but with the clichÃ© characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch rutina wesley absolutely murders the accent it's like nails on a chalkboard bad almost as awful is nelsan ellis it's difficult to understand what he's even saying sometimes both his character as well as tara's also seem a bit racist to me i don't know having a character say 'whycome' on an hbo show that isn't the wire just seems a bit odd rounding out the cast so far are sookie's doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i've seen in william sanderson as the sheriff br br the story seems to be meandering towards it's destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadow sy although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i'm not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless br br about the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air
<START> robert urich was a fine actor and he makes this tv movie believable i remember watching this film when i was 15 and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club in a computer rich californian town urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family and i love the halloween space suit idea brilliant this film is about the battle of one's sprit tv quality that exceeds the big budget gangs of new york i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie i hope so 6 or 7 out of 10
<START> this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii the performances are incredible especially anthony steele the movie works on many different levels cerebral emotional visual and literal the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true in fact an unusual all around authenticity puts this one head and shoulders above most war epics
<START> vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos open your eyes and in my opinion a much more human and emotional version tom cruise plays david aames a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted and thinks only of himself jason lee plays brian shelby david's best and in many ways only friend penelope cruz plays sofia serrano brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to david's birthday party cameron diaz plays julie gianni david's occasional bed buddy kurt russell plays dr curtis mccabe a psychologist interviewing david all of their interactions and the consequences of them make vanilla sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made i won't explain anymore of the plot because it's far more compelling the less you know ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow if you pay attention you won't be confused the film is very complex but not confusing and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made
<START> in contrast to my fellow reviewers i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see yes the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping something must be lost in the translation of the word bloodsucker from the italian in the title almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so tacked it onto the film anyway br br this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect italian softporn from the mid 1970s i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli credited most often as krista nell the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s 70s i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned i think krista nell played cora but underneath that massive hair style costume and make up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure br br there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out maybe something is lost in the dubbing process what were the positive points well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island it purports to be set in ireland north or the republic in 1902 so everyone sports period piece costumes some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes anyway an enjoyable romp i rated it 4 10
<START> i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez to see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelman little luke was not on there i know that walter brennan had died so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelman little luke i would be thankful i have searched everywere and no luck the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned the shows today dont have that the whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do thank you glenda
<START> whereas the hard boiled detective stories of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop indeed creating the definitively modern american genre and style in the process those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever the problem with books like those of agatha christie dorothy l sayers or s s van dine on whose work this film is based is that they are low on action or variety whereas sam spade or philip marlowe traverse the mean streets of la working class tenements bars offices wealthy mansions and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence golden age fiction is generally fixed in location the scene of the murder usually a lavish country house and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects this is a very static procedure plot reduced to puzzle br br this of course is as much ideological as anything else the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement the hard boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre both of authority and of a city dividing itself up into hostile ever uncontrollable and lawless camps another major problem with golden age fiction is character because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end we cannot gain access to characters' motivations or emotions being defined solely by their potential need to murder the detective unlike the anxious prejudice ridden private eyes are simply there to be brilliant and maybe a little eccentric br br the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period recreations of the merchant ivory jane austen school and end up looking silly there have been successes for example the radical reworkings of ellery queen and others by claude chabrol in the english speaking world there have really only been two the alistair sim classic 'green for danger' works because it pushes the form almost into parody while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery br br before that came michael curtiz's brilliant 'the kennel murder case' the narrative is pure golden age a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him he is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner indicating suicide slumped in a locked room the caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait it is up to philo vance gentleman and amateur detective neither old nor fat to read the clues more insightfully open the case out of the confines of the room and eventually solve the case the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation br br what is interesting is not this detective plot which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are although it is rarely less than entertaining and full of comical bits of business there isn't even really an attempt to 'subvert' the image of the perfect detective there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect with no protest from vance but that's about it br br what marks 'kennel' as a classic is its modernity curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development but he was hollywood's greatest craftsman and he is on sensational form here if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme creating an abstract variation on his source reducing narrative character and location to geometry a series of lines from the beautiful art deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition and as they glide furiously at an angle jolt the dead decor to life br br this treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors like the two central brothers or the original crime itself borrowed from an 'unsolved mysteries' book this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental relics shades of 'the moonstone' inscrutable chinese servants ex cons turned butlers dog loving fops runyonesque cops is the perfect habitat for vance a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a fanciful hunch who knows the social world of these people and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police or would be if he wasn't anything more than a thinking machine william powell the greatest american comedian of the decade bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity br br but if the treatment is rarefied the climax is spectacularly brutal involving vicious dogs and attempted murder the police and the detective supposed to be preventing crime are guilty of inciting one
<START> my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasnÂ´t seen the tv series but it amuses the fans too the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox this is a good film
<START> germans think smirking is funny just like americans think mumbling is sexy and that women with english accents are acting i had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close up of a smirking face one of those 'housewife hacks corporate mainframe' tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home pc which is connected only to a power socket the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady can't say i share his feelings there's quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is
<START> this place in england during 1940 three orphans carrie charles and paul are sent to live with miss price angela lansbury she doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft ok i realize this is a family film but college of witchcraft come on before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war and she seeks down the head professor browne david tomlinson and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob br br i first saw this when i was 9 and vaguely remember loving it it sure doesn't hold up as an adult the story is silly even for a fantasy the kids are terrible actors and one of them charles is incredibly obnoxious also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes there's also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor for disney and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals there are a few saving graces here lansbury and tomlinson are just great the songs while forgettable are pleasant the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end but the weak story line poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down i heard the extended version is even worse i can only give this a 7
<START> this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of love josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being self centered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian the scenery breath taking and the message of love genuine
<START> well i'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i've seen in a long time we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended yeah ok with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again br br well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film however the film then continues on for a whole other hour and in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers oh yea and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah just because you know your making an epic film doesn't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film br br oh wait and the film isn't the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesn't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again br br there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography the land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say br br one last thing i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface also a better film than this of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian the rest are just americans being silly oh and please ms rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands oh i would br br the good earth is one epic waste of time if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets mainly because it wasn't written by a monkey
<START> remarkable disturbing film about the true life senseless brutal murder of a small town family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers dick hickok and perry smith br br no matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this br br this really traces multiple tragedies the tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the clutter family a decent farm family in small town holcomb kansas and the wasted brutal and sad lives of hickok and smith br br an interesting point is made in the film that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone but together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them they push each other along a road of proving something to each other that they were man enough to do it to carry it out neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led these were two grown up children who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the clutters br br the film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the clutter family but the point is made these were respected law abiding small town people who didn't deserve this terrifying fate the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith perry smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with br br an interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with to be deterred you must believe it's possible you will be caught is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them this was supposed to be a cinch no witnesses br br when caught hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that hickok has cowardly caved in hickok blinked first a silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous men br br fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history stunning portrayals by robert blake and scott wilson these roles made their careers
<START> several years ago when i first watched grey gardens i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it but after many viewings i've come to see the beauty in the strange twisted relationship between the inseparable big edith bouvier beale and her daughter little edith bouvier beale br br mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term shabby chic with innumerable cats raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day the result is a hilarious beautiful sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule br br the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love and their lives an example of drive determination and free will this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself br br
<START> this apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking but feeding the masses comes off lame as some of the stiff legged zombies stalking the streets in rhode island a zombie epidemic known as the lazarus virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations a couple of brave but dumb souls at channel 5 tv news feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand an eager reporter racheal morris and her cameraman william garberina with the aid of a military escort patrick cohen risk life and limb to present a 'live' broadcast to show the doom at hand do yourself a favor and don't watch this thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad acting is atrocious and the flesh hungry zombies are almost comical also appearing are michael propster william decoff and brenda hogan feeding the masses should be left to starve
<START> little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farmers in saskatchewan the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report
<START> i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great or i wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day i like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gay themed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate those that walked out as i considered doing after about three minutes probably didn't mind shelling out 11 00 or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place br br logan is bored he's a klutz he's gay i'm okay with that the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc etc nothing or no one goes anywhere no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting probably most appalling of all is that i didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan that in itself is a major accomplishment he didn't grow he didn't change he didn't learn there is no one to teach him anything he didn't do anything and neither did the movie scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make br br additionally the title makes no sense at all 1 10
<START> this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife is pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it since there was real no name actress in this picture i can't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8
<START> this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians felix herngren and fredrik lindstrÃ¶m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today and this film really puts that on display br br vuxna mÃ¤nniskor adult people is a warm hearted and hilarious story about adulthood and the question if we wouldnÂ´t be better off without it
