<START> i like monster movies generally even if they are implausible and silly but its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly and tries to take itself seriously all at the same time like in a really posh kind of way br br while the idea is somewhat factual like orcas are known for killing great white sharks its really hard to find it scary when i can't help but just see an angry shamoo destroying stuff especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the orca's doing and while it explodes the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like i was watching a show at sea world with fireworks plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen on top of that it takes a few jabs at jaws its like hey look we're being factual and we can come up with better reasons why the orca is attacking br br yes you are ignoring your outrageous ups in logic of course but jaws had one thing your movie doesn't its scary yes its implausible yes its somewhat outrageous but quite frankly factual or not a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more even jaws the revenge is scarier than this
<START> i have to finish watching a movie once i start regardless of how bad it is this movie was agonizing to sit through the sparkling bullets the reporter with ninja like moves the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from what the heck are you doing in here holding a bat to hey you're cute wanna in like 1 2 seconds just bad save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids or dog
<START> you've been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about femme fatale guns n' gals movies now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries ninja movies many of these i've seen before and let me tell you they aren't all that's cracked up to be they usually don't stick to the point this among all others suffers from no originality what's a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in russia and isn't this supposed to be a martial arts movie too does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you is blood the number one reason to love this to death will you waste some of your hard earned cash over a lady singing in her see through tank top the answers to these important questions are found in the ninja mission which should be in the martial arts section of your video store for even more nonsense ninja fun try checking out those godfrey ho movies put out by trans world you get what you deserve and that's a promise recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts
<START> actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling dark and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic paxton himself who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but demons and that they have been selected by god to destroy these demons this is all told in flashback by one of the sons now grown up matthew mcconaughey to skeptical fbi agent powers boothe br br hard to automatically forget this film better than most serial killer features it's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks paxton commendably barely shows any blood at all until near the end well acted by all especially the two child actors jeremy sumpter of the recent peter pan and matt o'leary of spy kids 2 and domestic disturbance the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach in any event it's an atypical thriller with a decent script br br 8 10
<START> andy hardy meets debutante 1940 is the ninth 9th film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into characters andy hardy mickey rooney and judge hardy lewis stone were going to be front and center the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in br br lewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve andys' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy 1946 his reaction to any 'teapot tempest' was the same juvenile br br in this film it is clearly illustrated andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved this screen writing device was known as the 'idiot plot' a means of stretching a poorly written scenario maybe it was less mickey rooneys' fault then the director and the writers most likely george b seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control rooneys' excesses to see our overview of the entire series go to you're only young once 1937
<START> on steve irwin's show he's hillarious he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'oh this is one nasty bloke ' and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead and terri had the worst acting i'd ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says 'steve' she didn't sound scared or anything it was just 'steve' i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid
<START> you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates a k a reads the script plot synopsis over his character's funeral procession a mere 5 minutes into the movie the narration is his character's last will testament it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants the children shall split 136 million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show br br there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voice over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending br br that journey is painfully slow and pointless we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux german expressionism the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children share br br celluloid rehab
<START> just saw the movie this past weekend i am upset and disappointed with it basically the movie tells you that immigrants the ones from former soviet union especially come to this country bring everyone they can with them from the old country and invade and take over what americans have been working for which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration and a much worse way of telling people about it that's the main thing another thing the overall writing directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs the actors did pretty well but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap a few jokes were funny but most were bad and cheesy couldn't wait to get out of the theater want my money back
<START> this film is as good as it is difficult to find the film's hero and writer and director is simon geist a man with an agenda he creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the swine of los angeles the actors the models the musicians who believe that their own defecation doesn't smell with clever dialog zucovic succeeds in doing this sure the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well any person who can reenact edward munk's 'the scream' in the reflection of a silver trashbin at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award give this film a chance and listen to what it says because they have been making the same car since 1986 it's called 'the car ' bravo zucovic bravo
<START> i won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as i'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with just a careless mish mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a boogeyman sequel literally 80 of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor the boogeyman a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress suzanna love's original character's name lacy right and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are 0 out of 10 and i wish imdb's rating system went that low the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off people's money i've even seen you have been warned
<START> normally i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest br br you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet well this movie was just terrible it is nigh on impossible to suspend disbelief i tried really i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me br br timberlake should stick to music what a dreadful performance no presence as an actor no character can't blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot badly timed editing its definitely an f br br after seeing this i have to wonder what really motivates actors i mean surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part did he not see how poor it was what then could motivate him to take the part money of course acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work br br ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script br br meanwhile the audience goes what the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this crap br br in short apart from justin a great lineup badly executed very disappointing
<START> matt cordell is back from the dead for a third go round although i'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid manica cop fans cordell who died in the last flick is resurrected through voodoo and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer cordell is very fond of i missed part of this early '90s low budget quickie but it was pleasing to see cordell wracking up the body count in various gruesome ways problem is the overall film is pretty static and cordell simply ain't jason or freddy the interest wanes pretty fast even with that grand b movie master robert forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled stick with the first film in the series which is funny and scary and exciting all at the same time
<START> i realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic that is the only positive thing i can say about this truly horrid adaptation br br have you read 'wise blood ' it's an amazing book flannery o'connor wrote about the south as no one else has she was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer in her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness the characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but i can assure you that such people do exist not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace' even in the most violent distressing and maddening of circumstances to read 'wise blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom finally it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions our entire world view br br none of this comes through in john huston's 'gilligan's island' like adaptation none it is a farce a bad farce the entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach the acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting the filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners ms o'connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre the soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'clockwork orange' style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the movie i was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out truly truly terrible br br as an aside i do not agree with ms o'connor's religious views and while i was raised in the deep south years ago i made my way north and have not looked back but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals like every other place on earth and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive if you're into being offended which i am not then this movie most definitely crosses the line br br i don't like to talk crap about an artist's work john huston was a man that i did not know and i'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history attests my views are clearly skewed by having read and loved flannery o'connor's work so i don't claim to be coming from any other perspective maybe as a stand alone film it works for cinephiles but for flannery o'connor fans and i might add for self respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes this movie is a waste of time
<START> ladies and gentlemen please don't get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tag this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film in shining there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive foolish attempt made to create chilling horror everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do there is not much to be said of a bald colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes
<START> watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements dhl aquawhite strips rockstar and more it's one product placement after another it's quite obvious how this movie got its funding jessica simpson's acting is laughable any dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same lame character the story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial i can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook who gets almost no screen time as jessica's cousin i'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
<START> this adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of rochester's character i get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read grumpy broody murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for charlotte bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave go and reread the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face
<START> rob roy is and underrated epic of passion and action some mild spoilers within liam neeson gives a towering performance as rob roy macgregor one of the best in his career jessica lange is letter perfect as his wife mary they have the most passion and chemistry i've seen in a screen couple john hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance tim roth portrays one of the great screen villains his rape of mary is repugnant and harrowing he really is a magnificent bastard in this movie the final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best swordfights ever well scripted ans scored and michael caton jones direction is flawless 10 out of 10

<START> i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first time production br br one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city brooklyn in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life Â again kudos to the director on this fine choice br br this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it i'm sure it will make it to the screen
<START> this is a great movie for all ages its the story about three animals how have to find their way home there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie you never know what is going to happen next this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh you just don't know what going to happen next the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors actress themselves everything about this movie is great 10 out of 10 the whole way rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will
