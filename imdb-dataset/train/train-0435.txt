<START> there are people claiming this is another bad language ultra violence mexican movie they are right but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become the awful truth hurts or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal one of the most important things of cero y van cuatro is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity is that what we all are is that all that we want to be i am abroad and i realized how spoiled is the mexican society when the tlahuac incident came to light i still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder i nearly puked when i saw some of the images it was not irak or rwanda just a tiny village near mexico city when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government the recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply the other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption dishonesty betrayal and violence but i consider tamales de chivo the best one br br the movie is deeper than some cabrÃ³n and pendejo screams those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people with a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country moreover honesty is only rewarded miraculously
<START> within 15 minutes my whole family was rooting for goldie hawn's character to die or at least for steve martin's character to leave her at 40 minutes we turned it off there are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can't even stomach it long enough for the story to get established br br normally i like both steve martin and goldie hawn and i remember enjoying the neil simon original so i blame marc lawrence and sam weisman combine the director of whats the worst that can happen and the writer of miss congeniality 2 and i guess this is what we end up with
<START> in this installment of the series edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain during the later portion of george iii's rule this time blackadder's prospects are much poorer as instead of royalty he's a servant to the very very thick george iv the price regent unlike the historical accounts of george iv this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result blackadder's able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart's content the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very very very different note you just have to see it to believe it other than that all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious the only reservation i have as always is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations
<START> michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was the only film he did purely for the money as well as the worst film he ever starred in hold on michael weren't you in the swarm and hurry sundown and weren't both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees fahrenheit temperatures the director richard fleischer was hospitalised as a result of sun stroke during the shoot what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low point of michael caine instead it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast exotic locations boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline br br dr david linderby caine is a w h o medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa beverly johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders led by suleiman peter ustinov and he sets off on a continent wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east br br along the way big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest the film is based on a best seller entitled ebano by the little known author alberto vasquez figueroa but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again there are occasional flashes of action but on the whole ashanti is quite slow moving all in all it is a resistible piece of action hokum not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let down from all the talent involved
<START> what about dahmer's childhood the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body what about infinity land the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger what about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father his feelings of neglect when his brother was born what about his fascination with insects and animals how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home what about focusing more on his cannibalism and what about his parent's divorce these are all things that should have been included in the film instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer br br why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people he could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind br br whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet known as rodney in this film my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasn't the scene in which he kills steven hicks his first victim is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing or that he didn't kill again for nine years we assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when and why br br what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations br br some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued br br finally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate not a 15 we needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his modus operandi was when actually killing anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people he actually killed seventeen men br br aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isn't all bad there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place
<START> i really hate this retarded show it sucks big time and personally i think it is insulting to fairy kind if you believe in fairies that is i mean the people who had come up with such crap 'ought to have their heads examine huh and also there is a lot of craziness the evil school teacher which i think is getting really old and also stupidity the boy's parents and fairy godfather in this show two of the things that i dispised and loathe in the whole world especially stupidity br br overall i say that this show is so f ' annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at all it would make'em bleed to death
<START> this movie is humorous charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is bing in his usual inimitable style performs quite well as the blacksmith hank martin who by accident is transported back to another age the time of king arthur the beautiful rhonda fleming is breathtaking as alisande or sandy the object of hank's affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable sir lancelot played by henry wilcoxon br br i just love that episode when king arthur cedric hardwicke sir sagramore wm bendix and hank bing crosby dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand king arthur's comment i say we are not alone while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch is one of those hilarious moments in the film william bendix's portrayal is superbly ridiculous not to mention his attempts at quaint ye olde english br br the story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it it's great family entertainment too br br
<START> when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction as long as that stands we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this century br br but i would say the alamo thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i've seen john wayne's film is a good one if over hyped but it's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was br br it's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result br br alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that one thing that was not explored and hasn't been was travis's hyperactive sex drive he was the casanova of the southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests br br but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie played here by james arness he was a hero at the alamo to be sure but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel he was a smuggler a slave trader an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to but his heroic death certainly redeemed him no hint of that is in arness's portrayal nor any others i've seen of bowie on the screen and of course he did design the bowie knife done to his specifications that man needed such a weapon br br however the main asset that the alamo thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation unfortunately those americans came with some pre conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south at least liberty for white people raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history he was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came along br br this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston greene's not quite my conception of houston he really was way too old for the part houston was in his early forties in 1836 he was not yet the patriarch of texas but within the limits imposed on him greene does a fine job br br for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne's version but for historical content i recommend this film highly
<START> this movie i won't call it a film was basically about nothing and functioned mostly for the popular acts of the time yeah the war was on full swing pun intended and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a treat br br but let's have something with a bit more substance br br loved seeing a young buddy rich on the drums the music was good throughout br br but one cameo after another gets old fast br br i didn't even recognize zero mostel so if you're one from the greatest generation as they say you'll definitely enjoy this br br movie
<START> a linear travel within a non linear structure it's a fact that time in 12 monkeys flows in this come and go between present future and past however the movie's linearity can't be avoided it's the very work of the projector the unfolding of the narrative br br what we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for free will br br right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997 forcing the few survivors to live underground the only place not affected by the virus br br cole's willis mission is clear return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus there's no way to change the past all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present that for us viewers is the future find the cure not to change what happened the past is inevitable but make the present better br br in his returns in time cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma his life in the past is better than his life in the present br br the latter is dark and dehumanizing controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect volunteers this word is incisively ironic to embark on the journeys to the past br br the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel and cole ends up on wrong dates this will later in the plot work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn stowe br br we can see through the evolution of the story that linearity and non linearity interlace in a circular temporality br br there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last and certainly the climactic appears it modifies itself according to the evocation of cole's memories that come up in his dreams br br in an airport a man is shot dead while running armed toward someone else a blonde woman runs after the murdered one br br this is the scene that connects the past in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents the present the time of the narrative and the future adult cole throughout the narrative cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now his prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist doctor peters morse that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease br br what was can't be changed and in cole's case what was is what will be eternally br br a film not quite well understood for many to me nothing less than a masterpiece br br other good movies with similar theme the back to the future trilogy that has another angle regarding the mad scientist character and although it shares the atmosphere of decay particularly in the second film it is way more optimistic than gilliam's work that is an odd hollywood picture br br in another register there is wild strawberries one of bergman's masterpieces that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences br br i've never watched la jetÃ©e but only because i can't find it
<START> beating the bad guys again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about it br br home alone one and two film classics home alone three and four a good film if you're three like sharkboy and lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny it's not culkin is replaced by alex d'linz or something else he's a very bland actor with bland performances but it's not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day and to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you don't believe me but you'll regret it
<START> pixar has had massive success over the years with the full length cgi animated movies they have made a bug's life was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far preceded by the company's feature length debut the groundbreaking toy story which was the first ever feature length cgi movie i remember when this follow up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's but i never actually saw it until november 2006 i watched it twice that month and over three years later i have seen it a third time it has never impressed me as much as probably any other pixar film i've ever seen but after three viewings i still think it's better than some of the films i've seen from dreamworks animation br br ant island is the home of a colony of ants these ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year one member of this colony is flik an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions even though he doesn't mean to one year when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it the grasshopper leader hopper decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season but they will have to double their offering flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds warrior bugs to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back princess atta the future queen lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering the inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors but after he takes them back to ant island and introduces them he learns that they are actually not warriors but circus bugs br br the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters to me none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have and generally seem a bit bland fortunately however it's not like shark tale a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character a bug's life does have a likable enough main character one which viewers can root for the story also seems somewhat bland at times but for the most part it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining and sometimes has some good suspense especially later on the humour like certain other aspects of the film isn't as good as it could have been but there are definitely funny moments some of them involving francis a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female you can always expect great animation from pixar and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception with all this movie has to offer it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to pixar standards but it is reasonable family entertainment
<START> the blob is a classic 1950s b movie sci fi flick you probably know the story two teens steve mcqueen aneta corsaut see a meteorite hit the ground and when they go to look for it they run into an old man with some weird blob attached to his arm they take him to the doctor's office and then go to find out what happened from there the blob spreads eating everyone in its path the special effects are cheesy fun as is the story there are a lot of great touches like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district it's no masterpiece but it has a special place in its genre steve mcqueen is very good 8 10
<START> a young and seemingly promising college graduate played by blair underwood is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row sean connery plays the happy go lucky attorney whom the young man's grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson laurence fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking an theory that connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime ed harris kate capshaw ruby dee and the late lynne thigpen co star in this very intense dramatic thriller
<START> the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time stunningly shot with lighting effects that are truly sublime this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d w griffith and maurice tourneur how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know but this film still has extraordinary power the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york is very moving the themes of social injustice revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today the use of close ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema
<START> one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff's movie as event of the thought' following the example of merab mamardashvili the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination this film monologue originated as a response to fellini's 8 Â½' and cost gert de graaff 13 years of work excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary the paradoxical co existence in two different galaxies that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen for some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality man' catholic' window washer' and together with him we fall into a trap when the author creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma how can one eliminate from the future movie bart klever just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been framed' really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day to day care for the young daughter br br so who is he this bart klever is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac's masterpiece just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves br br
<START> my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes the characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing the story is made up of mini plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan br br
<START> this is the 2nd time i've seen this movie in about 12 years these remarks come from someone who finds kane and ambersons to be amazing worthy films but the remainder of welles career is unfortunately squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering and when he makes a potboiler like shanghai the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on is just kind of sad i couldn't tell you what he was exploring here it's all as mannered as welle's godawful irish brogue which takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the film several welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque mr arkadin pick a version any version is a similarly belabored project the material is inconsequential it just can't bear the weight of all this noodling for a director trafficking in reality based drama as here he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality or to a coherent story the murder for hire scheme is ridiculous br br kudos to welles though for having hayworth cut her hair and getting that performance out of her the camera loves her she's the classiest most upscale sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film but her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision made so the movie will have some genre it fits into the movie can't be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds br br when all is said and done in l f s the convolutions are all for what to convince you you've seen something thoughtful to give welles more to do to make you roll your eyes welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to telling a story directly one wonders what shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled billionaire arranging a quadruple cross murder for hire scheme or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance br br overwrought preposterous unengaging
<START> this has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy i've ever seen in my life ben stiller jack black and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can't make me laugh something's got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie i've ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can wholeheartedly say that the only movie i've ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead the only worse movie i laughed very slightly at the merry go round scene and that's it spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right i don't know i guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something and the other running joke really is beating a dead horse literally
<START> once upon a time there were different types of movies these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer br br this seems obvious at first but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans that's all it is it doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture literally after all hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people bodyguard or the preacher's wife w whitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mind br br first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti there are worse things in this world and worse movies the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun the movie starts with schubert's ave maria and then leoncavallo's matinatta pav sings arias from la gioconda manon lescaut and turandot but also sings popular music such as i left my heart in san francisco and the song that was nominated for an oscar golden globe if we were in love w music by john williams lyrics by alan marilyn bergman all 3 previous oscar winners br br the story isn't that bad it was built for pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago when asked to sing again at the same place the met in nyc he loses his voice from fear doctor pamela or pah may lah in italian played by kathryn harrold gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts br br they embark on an affair she knowing he's married promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman despite all that they fall in love thus the song if we were in love and with her help he overcomes his fear goes back to the met where he triumphs i won't tell how it ends but it's fairly predictable which isn't always a bad thing br br the performances in this aren't that bad pavarotti who plays giorgio fini isn't an actor so if you're expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance you are deluded not pavarotti he knows he's not a thespian what he is is cute charming charismatic he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too it's not so bad one funny line is when he tells pamela harrold that she's a thirsty plant fini can water you and of course she says i don't want to be watered on by fini kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little one of my favorite lines in the movie is life never has to be life size and there's eddie albert who does his usual good job as fini's manager there are several themselves cameos by real conductors singers etc and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center br br if you like opera if you like pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go enjoy a little fling just like he proposes in the movie then you can enjoy this movie for what it is i know i do every time br br
