<START> just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff re hatched i read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my fault someone said it was good no more gory horror or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please don't bother with this movie get mary poppins now thats scary i'm off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe
<START> when plague breaks out in new orleans it's richard widmark to the rescue in panic in the streets one of the lesser celebrated films of the great elia kazan kazan keeps the pace brisk and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between widmark and barbara bel geddes who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low lifes portrayed by a menacing jack palance his weak yes man zero mostel tommy cook and louis charles there are also some interesting visuals palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height br br the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily that aside it's well worth viewing kazan was a masterful director
<START> this movie was a complete waste of time br br i viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of genius as one of my fellow commenters on this site had the gall to label this steaming pileÂ not one of them found a single redeeming quality we ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives i will not reprint here br br i can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by sir anthony hopkins himself afterall as one of those reviewers will tell you he financed the film himself Â because no one else in hollywood or anywhere else in the world for that matter would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film don't let the semi famous actors who appear in the film lure you into its clutches Â as christian slater admits in the special features making of he signed on to the film without reading the script or knowing any details a folly i am sure he will never repeat br br i pity the hapless individual who stumbles into this quagmire of self indulgence written directed produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece and if you don't believe me please google anthony hopkins and art
<START> why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cash br br the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it's a muddled muddy mess br br there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland br br there are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply isn't clear br br there was also a yank woman in the film it wasn't clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophillia br br a pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film
<START> as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event i was very disappointed with the movie granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the hollywood portrayal of this british little big horn was truly boring br br the amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their money's worth br br despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed whenever peter o'toole or burt lancaster finished a scene i would cringe with disappointment their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectively br br there are worse epics but this one is not much better
<START> superficically brigadoon is a very promising entertainment package gene kelly and vincente minnelli the team behind an american in paris are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations gene's leading lady is cyd charisse one of the best dancers of 40s 50s cinema and unlike the generally superior it's always fair weather this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as my fair lady and minnelli's musical masterpiece gigi lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent american in paris br br what happened along the way why is the movie itself such a stupid bore minnelli himself didn't want to do the movie despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner maybe it was because the movie's innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting if not liberating way the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold br br while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like cabin in the sky and meet me in st louis the plaid tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never have been locales its whimsy doesn't even match up to the glossy luster of yolanda and the thief or the pirate because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect for example in exchange for brigadoon's immortality the honorable and most generally good pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge br br at one point we're assured that everybody's looking for their own brigadoon suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren't looking for this kind of quasi queasy paradise the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing but could work if the players were perfect but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in yolanda and the thief van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like levant in aip and he provides a lot of amusing moments but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed off van johnson performance
<START> i love paul mccartney he is in my oppinion the greatest of all time i could not however afford a ticket to his concert at the tacoma dome during the back in the u s tour i was upset to say the least then i found this dvd it was almost as good as being there paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come br br i do have one complaint i would of like to hear all of hey jude br br also paul is not dead br br the single greatest concert dvd ever br br out of
<START> i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting
<START> two sailors are on leave ladies man joseph brady gene kelly and shy innocent clarence doolittle frank sinatra they meet beautiful susan abbott kathryn grayson and both fall in love with her there's more but you've probably guessed it br br the story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick also this movie is far too long it's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra still this is worth catching br br when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care it's shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had the acting is ok kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and sinatra is just great although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at some shots of her literally took my breath away there are plenty of highlights here sinatra and kelly's big dancing and singing number sinatra singing anything grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry an animated mouse tom does a funny cameo too also there's little dean stockwell who steals every scene he's in br br so it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching this was a huge hit in its day
<START> this film never received the attention it deserved although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen clearly filmed on a small budget in a real v a hospital the center of the story is joel very well played by eric stoltz joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries joel is in love with anna his married lover played by helen hunt who shows early signs of her later academy award winning work br br although the joel anna relationship is the basic focus there are many other well developed characters in the ward wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist bloss i think forsythe's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers and later when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up my favorite scene with snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post injury sexual options br br the chemistry between stoltz and hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate but not gratuitous sex scenes the orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing there is also another memorable scene where joel and bloss and the korean boy take the specially equipped van to the strip bar it's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the naked ladies br br the story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director neal jimenez is paralyzed in real life this is basically his story this film is real not glossy or flashy to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing i recommend this film to everyone i see because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look it's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked but through video perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves
<START> i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes i read yalom's book about a year ago and loved it in fact admire yalom's work in general i am a clinical psychologist i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off i'm not sure if i can take much more at a superficial level the faux accents as others have commented are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious the portrayal of lou salome is simply flippant and the brilliant freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy i see very little of the book's spirit conveyed thus far i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students instead i will refer them to the book imagine that
<START> i've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment i just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange he's a fine actor but mr rochester he definitely isn't and zelah was just well strange bit of a mix matched couple in it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel a real let down
<START> i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie i'm still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood clichÃ© imaginable all the while flogging us with the 'corporations are the ultimate evil' message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide it's own spoilers br br the story appears to be a computer nerd's fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker i think among many other nerd fantasy come true elements that you'll have to see for yourself br br as well i should've known it would be a z movie when i saw ned bellamy he tends to be a good tip off br br can't recommend this one i'm afraid
<START> this movie is bizarre better put it's freakin' weird i could give you a plot summary or some hoity toity analysis but i would consider it a waste of your time all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters one incestuous relationship homicide post mortem mutilation and one really disturbing infatuation at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself but not in a good way like after pulp fiction or fight club it's like you're a teenager or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager and have just done something you a wish you hadn't done and b hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about and nobody likes that my advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch kazaam yes i would rather watch kazaam than murderous maids read into it what you want
<START> like other people who commented on frÃ¤ulein doktor i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning br br to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi the others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory gallipoli and the post war la vie et rien d'autre and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks br br i only wish i had taped the film
<START> the man who directed 'the third man' also directed the 'who will buy' sequence in oliver now that is talent br br i raise my hat to carol reed br br i know there are 'second units' involved but still br br and he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed br br i suppose quality will out br br it does show in the final scene with nancy avoiding spoiler everyone has to see oliver for the first time sometime how many lines do i need to type br br encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged br br i hope this counts as the 10th line
<START> ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and he's the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know it's one of two things an indie or a dog as in sat on a shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming
<START> let me be really clear about this movie i didn't watch this movie because of the plot i watch it for the saucy sex scenes that being said this movie is so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of traci mandy schaffer and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot br br spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing you see a woman painting something by the lakeside in pure bliss and serene then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her when they both finished they show each other what they had done and the woman painted a vineyard when she is facing infront of the lake what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake and in another scene traci gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole and then she swims away and none of the town's police suspected her once i mean hellooooo mandy did not wear a glove did she her finger prints are all over the god damn boat after that it gets worst whenever mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit it's also a real pity rosanna arquette's is in this movie i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft porn no brainer same goes for jÃ¼rgen prochnow who also has the misfortune to star in this movie all in all 2 10
<START> if saura hadn't done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el amore brujo 1986 sevillanas 1992 salomÃ© 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose saura's 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia pales br br iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albÃ©niz 1860 1909 and in particular his iberia suite for piano isaac albÃ©niz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture its re formatting for a non spanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and d'indy he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravel's bolero but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have repossessed albÃ©niz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispano arabic and jewish cultures iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar the very concept is more diluted br br saura's flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmaker's important collaborators the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of saura's other musical films it's the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olÃ©'s that is the story and creates the magic because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story br br iberia is in a similar style to some of saura's purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albeniz's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in iberia if you love saura's flamenco you'll want to see iberia but you'll be a bit disappointed the style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but iberia's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
<START> this has to be the worst movie ever the acting is scarier than the movie lots of blood but no idea where it comes from cuz they don't even show you the cuts i can't believe i wasted my time watching this movie we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie this is a disgrace to horror films for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash cans there's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time the film editing is a joke my teenager could do better and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue do not watch this movie not to even see how bad it is you will be sorry you did
