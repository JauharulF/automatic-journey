<START> this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture it's still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing there's no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie it's their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesn't make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichÃ©s but somehow manages to transport a story oi warning is full of clichÃ©s doesn't tell anything new or provocative and that's the sad thing about this movie it's far from any oi reality br br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael haneke christoph schlingensief oskar roehler hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel br br benny's video funny games die unberÃ¼hrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmÃ¤uschenstill br br out of ten because of the topic and the photography
<START> when american author edgar allan poe visits london he is approached by british journalist alan foster who becomes the target of a peculiar wager not believing poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwood's haunted castle once installed in the abandoned castle foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror i was mesmerized the entire time i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful babs steele is undeniably beautiful the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing the topless scene threw me for a loop as i was not expecting it it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it's the uncut international version to boot this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection
<START> this movie is despite its independent status a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother daughter relationship it wasnt that bad at first but somewhere during the course of the movie around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i think it turns into a cheesey mother daughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter its probably better that way though
<START> seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrown in oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the one liners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever br br lungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van damme's movies seagal's movies and stallone's non rocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph that's worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees like in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie br br the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick and doing a really awful job at that br br an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non underwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight scene ending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill in between the flashes of nudity br br a bad bad movie
<START> i must say i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected scenario and acting is quite good the director made a good job as well although some scenes look a bit clumsy it is a decent movie overall the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good the plot was clear consistent and well thought some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development moral of the story it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good
<START> james bond in the wilderness well that's the way it looks pierce brosnan is after all best known as bond in tommorrow never dies 1997 and golden eye 1995 both shot prior to this release frankly the film's two leads are both badly miscast with brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance and with annie galipeau as pony grey owl's love interest having to battle with carelessly written dialogue br br the two aunts on the other hand are perfect but the film is not about aunts it is about the wilds of the canadian wilderness and while the photography may be pretty there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds annie galipeau as pony just fails to be convincing unfortunately because i really wanted to believe in her she was a relatively inexperienced twenty year old on this film and it could have worked but richard attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her he makes her look vulnerable which of course she is but in the wrong sort of way br br but one thing for sure she appears picture perfect throughout but mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness it just doesn't fit especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with bond sorry grey owl and use photo ops for kissing close ups br br i've lived with forest people in the pacific north west and they simply don't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival which brings me to another point the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set the 1930s i put the blame here largely on a lack lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action br br william nicholson wrote the screenplay and his latest offering elizabeth the golden age opened three days ago so i do hope there is an improvement br br yes i've read the comments others have posted but i'm not convinced a lot of potential but mishandled and even maybe ill conceived if it had had a religious film it would have been panned but because it preaches environmentalism the film remains somewhat above criticism since it is politically correct sorry for all that i don't buy it amen
<START> the priyadarshan paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie at an indian multiplex with high hopes especially after the slick promos unfortunately like hulchul before it this movie was a huge disappointment br br like others have commented the premise of the movie which was already stale to begin with just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering after a while you just want the movie to end so you can go home if i had been watching this at home it would have been much easier to cut my losses akshay kumar's performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments but overall because his role and character wasn't given much room to grow he didn't make much of an impact in this film br br neha dhupia who makes only an appearance in the movie was fun to look at while she was on screen and some of the songs are fun especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby respectively otherwise you're better off just passing on this movie
<START> this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don't understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies
<START> i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv it was on the sundance channel and was just starting i love music especially late 60s and this is what the bjm sounded like the dandys are alright everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music to anton and joel's personalities to the illicit drug use it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch the look on their faces were priceless anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time br br just watch it seriously
<START> i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12 00pm on 08 10 06 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don't like this movie are firstly the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn't make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and kik's sexual intercourse that 's what i was waiting forÂÂ however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
<START> i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv listings and watched it again there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to let's say somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations politics aside music sex movie idols music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california br br this was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i won't say this was the yugoslav american graffiti but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's themed movies
<START> it was once suggested by pauline kael never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a technician or rhetorician this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and scandinavian introversion never before have inner demons been so exposed physically br br it's about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it's got the echoes of ghosts all around rowlands' breakdowns which are stupefying and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a jumpy unsettling piano who is this dead girl the metaphysical possibilities are endless and it's amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never flapped it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates br br there's so much going on the pure joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and almodovar borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film br br it's a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of cherry we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being reflexive or does she just not care her character's breakdowns are incorporated into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it's like witnessing a female james dean 10 10
<START> yeah it's a bit of a silly film so if you are looking for an oscar performance forget this one but if you love john candy's humor this is a must see we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy and he is only better in one movie planes trains automobiles with steve martin excellent supporting performance by eugene levy perhaps his best work ever as the hot headed sal dipasquale also good acting by richard libertini alley mills pat hingle you must see this obscure and out of print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan
<START> as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values aren't bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing br br the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women has the writer been living under a rock br br although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone it's terrible it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after
<START> this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present 1920s in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton's amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out
<START> in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be children's they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch sequels usually make me nervous however this one did pretty well for itself knowing that it didn't have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it but if you want to watch a simple fun energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one
<START> it doesn't take long to see why code name diamond head didn't make it onto the network schedules the tv pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be maybe i missed something because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense based on what i got out of the muddled mess a terrorist or thief or something named tree ian mcshane goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon the world's dullest secret agent johnny paul roy thinnes is out to stop him there might have been more but trust me Â it really doesn't matter anyway br br action movies should have action suspenseful moments should have suspense and dramatic moments should have drama there's none of that in code name diamond head i've seen others use the word turgid to describe this made for tv snoozer Â and it's better than any one word description i can come up with none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable his charisma is just slightly north of a slug ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it but unfortunately for everyone else involved it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead well then you might have had something br br i'm quickly discovering that these gawd awful 70s made for tv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes and that goes double if quinn martin was involved very funny stuff from mike and the bots so while i may only give the movie a 3 10 i rate episode 608 a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> never saw the original movie in the series i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie it was however a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water not really worth watching i would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's the town the dreaded sundown
<START> this is a piece of s t this looks worse than a made for t v movie and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results war is prettier than this jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now no script no story and no time should be wasted on this i mean that 1 out of 10 is too high way too high goldberg should be jackhammered for this van shame is no actor
<START> the book is fantastic this film is not there is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book hell total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world the bleak german expressionistic colours the black and white footage from the vision screens there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984 the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage this film decides to take a mock communistic approach to set design atmosphere and theme yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist worship the humble worker theme itself this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before i could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap the soundtrack is annoying the lack of foresight is annoying this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novel's messages to the viewer
