<START> undoubtedly one of the great john ford's masterpieces young mr lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released including the most mythical western in the history of the genre john ford's milestone stagecoach and many others such as gone with the wind the wizard of oz mr smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr lincoln was nominated for which is original screenplay br br it continued to be the most underrated ford's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford's masterpieces but by the end of the 1950s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director sergei eisenstein about the young mr lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then it would be definitely john ford's young mr lincoln impressed by such an undoubted preference from eisenstein critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film's reputation has been increasing ever since br br it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american presidents was brought to the screen right in the beginning of the 1930s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford's film mgm released john cromwell's one called abe lincoln in illinois curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in 1938 and written by robert sherwood br br as far as john ford's films are concerned we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical lincoln's figure in several of director's works such as 1924 the iron horse or 1936 the prisoner of the shark island the second one just as young mr lincoln utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite lincoln's song dixie br br the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and lincoln's biographies was written by lamar trotti in collaboration with john ford himself which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of abraham lincoln's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears generator where lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney played by donald meek demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other br br overall it's a very touching heart warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of john ford's genius at one of its best deliveries ever a definite must see for everyone 10 10
<START> this was truly dreadful it had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good br br it took all my tenacity to make it through this one it's a good job i didn't have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic br br the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women not a bad one among them br br if you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one's for you else avoid it like the plague
<START> look i loved the proper anchorman film but this was reaaaaallly bad the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life the kind of bad that makes you think what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place the kind of bad that makes you wish you'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a pauly shore film instead seriously i cannot explain how very bad this was br br having said that there were some semi amusing laughs but they are all so much less funny than anchorman sure they tried to make it entertaining and fun but the entire subplot that was left out of anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason it wasn't even a little bit good br br do yourself a favour or in the usa a favor and don't watch this dvd it will tarnish the good movie that anchorman is and you don't want to do that br br okay i'm alright now
<START> what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless movie a remake that did not need to be retold everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments worst movie i ever saw save your time and money br br nicgolas cage was biking down hills swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene br br although a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies don't they get a copy of the script first if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd
<START> both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability i simply cried glenn close's role as ruth showed her wanting to deal with the situation but she was under the domination of her husband let him think about what he did robert duvall's character joe said staunchly the story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother called the stone boy meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did he became emotionally paralyzed then towards the end when jason presson's character arnold let it all out to a stranger i was so broken hearted for him that i actually thought of some of the terrible things that i did in my life i personalized and identified with his character frederick forrest's and gail youngs' roles did not add not much to the film i thought of frederick forrest who played ruth's antagonistic womanizing brother andy as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation his wife lou played by gail youngs acted like a crazy lady smacking arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles i could not really feel sorry for these two though lou tried to keep her marriage together she was unsuccessful both did not deal with their problems effectively they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous wilfred brimley's minor role as the grandfather was touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention i felt his role should have been elaborated the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient however i really liked the ending so much i actually smiled and cried tears of joy i felt good the hillermans were a family again i actually wanted to be a part of this family they were so realistic
<START> a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish high anxiety the cheap detective the black bird don't look now we're being shot at and have no profile at all today norman was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film an experiment at the time norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong just as it should be in fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today
<START> visually stunning most definitely i have seen few films look this good in some time sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh the time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason also mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide who can stop them and save the world alright it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead and in the wings his trusty thoroughly competent sidekick what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization the plot for this film is ridiculous that being said the film is going for a serial like feeling of film serials of yesteryear they had pretty far out stories and bad acting but none of them and i mean none of them had the budget and big names this film had two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film afloat one would think but sky captain sinks miserably despite its fantastic dark look i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life i had little interest in a story that generated little interest i didn't care at all for any of the glib portrayals paltrow was just awful jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance law cannot carry the one liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders i mean let's face it he's not will smith mel gibson or even wesley snipes the sad thing about sky captain at least for me was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little i was bored ten minutes into the film waiting for something to hook my interest and it never came
<START> the main reason people still care about carlton browne of the f o is that it features peter sellers in a second billed role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake br br sellers plays amphibulos a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt poor island nation of gaillardia formerly a british colony now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war amphibulos wants to play both u k and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terry thomas is the title character a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasn't forgotten them all appearances to the contrary br br a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason carlton browne is considered below average is because the comedy is non existent br br after a decent opening that establishes the film's only two strengths a sympathetically doltish terry thomas and john addison's full on larky score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes the low opinion of carlton browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death by the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes expectations are quite low br br they're still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick accented announcer in war the army uses many horse br br sellers never quite takes center stage even when we're on his character's island the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father's assassination bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scene stealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that roared and i'm all right jack br br strange that this film like jack was a boulting brothers production with roy boulting here serving as co director alongside jeffrey dell usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything goes comedy but here there are only fey jabs in either direction amphibulos works his mangled english vibe for all its worth this man is like how do you say the bull in the chinese ship while carlton browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve br br the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris's romance with ilyena score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed br br the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by carlton browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly doa
<START> student seduction finds saved by the bell alumni elizabeth berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky corey sevier speaking for myself i can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when i was a student that was a ms diaz who was a music teacher in junior high school even as a young gay kid i could see what she was doing to the rest of the class she was the only teacher i had who in any way could have been played by elizabeth berkley br br corey being the hotty he is is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not the fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief he's flunking chemistry which is what berkley teaches and to keep his gpa up she agrees to tutor but believe no more br br so when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego when berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of pamela smart and mary kay letourneau just don't believe here sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy br br student seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way after the beating that berkley took for showgirls this tv film was not an upward career move
<START> a newlywed couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife it's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house she sees skulls all around the house but when the husband investigates he can't find anything is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house br br this is the first time that i've watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew and it will in all likelihood be the last time i watch it this way can you say dull i'm not talking ordinary dull i'm talking watching grass grow dull there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it the characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable the screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide br br the actors don't help matters much most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play i haven't looked it up but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value i won't even go into the script the actors are given to work with let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film br br you've been warned either avoid this one at all costs or at least seek out the mst3k version
<START> the ringmaster stars jerry springer as a tv talkshow host called jerry but it s not the jerry springer show his guests are trailer trash but not the trailer trash you get on the jerry springer show they attack one another but not like on what is the point of making a movie about the jerry springer show and pretending it s not the jerry springer show and on top of that this is a very boring film
<START> this is not the stuff of soap operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life a testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding
<START> i get the feeling that those involved in making surviving christmas didn't put much thought into the movie the characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend christmas with them br br ben affleck portrays drew latham the typical hollywood image of a wealthy egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life his girlfriend missy leaves him shortly before christmas because she's disgusted that drew wanted to take her to fiji for christmas which she calls the family holiday and the fact that drew has never introduced her to his family we later find out that drew's father left when he was 4 years old and his mother is dead so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family br br out of fear of being alone on christmas drew tracks down missy's shrink why i have no idea who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home when he meets the family living in his childhood home the valcos drew offers them 250 000 to pretend to be his family so he can relive his fond childhood memories he gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter alicia christina applegate because he doesn't have a sister and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his real family none of this makes any sense once drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother br br also inexplicable is the character of alicia who is annoyed that her family accepted drew's money and refuses to play along with his fantasy but for no good reason she suddenly starts to like drew and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy i almost wish he had finished with just kidding the real reason i don't see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me 2 10
<START> a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks' blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it is br br the laugh track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is br br however it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr trying his best to impersonate cleavon little his embarrassment shows through in every scene he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese br br truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse
<START> i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now i must really love it right well not really br br i was a surfer earlier in my life and i loved the sport to this day i am fascinated by good surfing riding giants has plenty of that and thus i am a sucker for the thing but i definitely have some bones to pick with it peralta you listening br br first the movie has too little faith in its subject matter the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined very very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic cut and pace method it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california not a single wave is ridden start to finish almost the entire section on mavericks one third of the movie is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop but he goes way too far mavericks is not just a bad acid trip waves are actually ridden there even with great performances it would have been good to see some of them if peralta thinks this is a grand sport and i am sure he does then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much at times the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii which i still cannot understand even if i run it on slow motion on dvd the image is too fast to be decipherable it must be a couple of frames in length at the max br br second have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on dvd these guys sound like two over the top valley girls the same sentiment shows up in the main production every thing is always so goddamn amazing etc one character in particular is just plain obnoxious sam george the editor of surfer magazine who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say he is a super drag on the movie br br there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie i mean just to get the old movie shots they have and also all of the interviews the movie is a great story and i think it is generally captivating entertainment thematically it is well laid out with the three parts centering around greg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton respectively there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal in the directors' narration they say it is a new type of 3d technology and it really works the three principle characters shine both in their interviews and in the water as an athlete laird hamilton is a revelation he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball and too the story of his meeting his father is a gem it really touched me br br it is just that the movie could have been so much more the very last part of the movie when the credits roll gives a hint of what it could have been there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish though you may like it if you are fan of the modern frenetic school of rock anyway there's my two cents
<START> i don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd orcas are most definitely not the cold blooded killer this movie makes them out to be its silly orcas are extremely intelligent don't get me wrong but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was so i was at least somewhat amused by it personally i'd recommend going and seeing jaws if you're wanting to see an animal killing humans type of movie but if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i'd say go ahead d
<START> this is a very chilling and for the most part a well thought out drama i am very impressed at the film not just for the plot and superb acting but that such a unique movie was made most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle but not this this isn't about this kind of war its about the war between a man and his position in life an american spy in germany posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget when the war is over campell thinks he will come home as a hero but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret going back to america campell meets nazi supporters as well as nazi haters providing for interesting conflicts both internally and externally nolte more than pulls off the role and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking
<START> in a word amazing br br i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan i was so totally wrong pinjar is a heart wrenching emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws i was haunted by it after watching it it lingered on my mind for so long the themes the pain the loss the emotion all was so real br br this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful thanks to gulzar sahib and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast br br if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie look no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart amazing cannot describe how excellent it is
<START> if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre i would change my rating to an eight try to imagine a movie where every scene line and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody i could probably crap out alphabet soup rearrange what was left of the letters and still have a better script two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie spoiler alert one is when mike's dad and the other dad walk i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead nothing happens to them when they reach the end the ex marine turns around says god you're a horny bastard and shoots only one the other is in the military complex the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans spoiler alert over these scenes must be seen to be believed still i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else
<START> it's not just that this is a bad movie it's not only that four of the best mexican movie makers are in this film and it's not only that the script is terrible it's just that this movie sucks big time this people are wasting money in terrible scripts it's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films is bad language supposed to be funny i don't get it mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing and being written and produced br br please don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico we hate them and they don't reflect us
