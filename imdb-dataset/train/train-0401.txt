<START> this is an arnold movie now that you know that i've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review if you don't like arnold then you wont like this movie if the case is the other then you will very probably like it it's as simple as that br br now if you're still reading this i expect you like arnold good for you he is quite good isn't he the running man is a very typical arnold feature it's got the usual retro future we know so well from 80's b sci fi it's got a bunch of terrible one liners lots of violence and explosions and a good looking heroine and a happy ending br br in this case the evil opponent is the all controlling 1984ish government which uses television as an effective crowd control with gladiator type game shows arnold of course ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up side down with a little help from his two confederates and the good looking amber br br it's not a big budget movie but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it it's hopelessly 80's but i find that charming acting is varying arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing with a helping of stone faced one liners heroine amber is to put it lightly a bit stereotypical and the subtly named damen killian is a typical evil tv man br br in spite of all it's flaws the movie shows its message very clearly television is an opiate of the masses a good way to control people it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience this does not seem futuristic at all today which is a bit alarming br br if you've seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one enjoy
<START> i am a dumber person for renting the dvd redline chicago pictures who made this stupid movie never paid palisades media group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an alexa rating of 16k they ripped me off on the deal and now i am out 16 000 and they wasted much of my personal time peter rapport of palisades media you know who you are br br please don't rent or buy this movie it sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists br br redline has a cast of losers and poor actors br br this movie is a joke
<START> the last hard men is a typical western for the 70's most of them seem to be inspired by sam peckinpah also this one but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes imo the beginning is very good in a certain way mclaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about charlton heston he has to play an old ex lawman named sam burgade but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock for me he didn't looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara hershey who is playing the sheriff's daughter maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles hershey and coburn are not showing their best but they are still good if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam burgade also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role on the other hand there is james coburn as outlaw zach provo coburn is a really great villain in this one he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness his role and his acting is the best of the movie br br landscapes and shootouts are terrific the shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic zach provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar overall it's an entertaining western flick not a great movie but above the average because of a great coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes
<START> a complex story laid on the background of partition of bharat an honest muslim who kidnaps an innocent hindu girl and an educated hindu who burns the harvest of a muslim man yet in the end you end up liking them both the story is powerful yet the screenplay and flow are hesitant background music score and the songs are outstanding next comes memorable acting by veteran urmila matondkar photography captures the time the violence and flavor of rural punjab very well others actors either did not act well or did not get a chance to act direction is really the weakest link the characters were not developed well not crisp in contrast to the earth where even a 5 line character leaves a mark the end is very interesting this story could have several different ending and all of them could have been equally good
<START> ho hum an inventor's horst buchholz deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands unknowingly his son luke perry has been working on the antedote all along enter cia agent olivia d'abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins also in the cast are tom conti hendrick haese and an aging roger moore moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts perry fans will be accepting d'abo is wrong for the role but nice to look at
<START> my friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home the convent a horror movie i couldn't wait to watch it given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious i can say that in some weird way i like this movie br br yes the acting is bad and yes it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen but it's so damn funny what are you smoking ca rack i didn't know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad br br yeah so overall the movie is pretty bad you gotta admit that much at least but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of it br br this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair' the dagger of despaaaaaair
<START> we all have friends some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister alice danes and darlene beckinsale are like that you can see that from the beginning they graduated together they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone br br brokedown palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about but first i want to say what is good about the film and for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than darlene but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice's bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand the film is photographed very well also the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice but it does show the necessary but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in johnathin kaplan's direction is quite good as well we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do we have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject some of the music is done by a group called delirium i think but it is sara mclaughlin wrong spelling but how do you spell her last name that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film br br what i didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit i won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what i am talking about also i didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic but i didn't get that here br br overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation let's just hope that it never comes down to that
<START> after you've seen this small likable and comical film you will for sure feel better cheer to yves b pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment that according to me will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the quebec the actors isabelle blais emmanuel bilodeau sylvie moreau and stÃ©phane gagnon all deliver a touching performance i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'amÃ©lie poulain have given me so if you've like the jean pierre jeunet magnificent film i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b pelletier les aimants
<START> i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead 2005 a little while back and since then i've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen like clive owen he has an intensity and he even resembles owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen i feel sure that if he lands some meaty roles he'll crack an oscar one day br br that's not to denigrate this film at all br br it's a fine story with very believable people well it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry a great cast Â chris cooper is always good and laura dern is always on my watch list Â with the appropriate mix of humor pathos excitement and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping br br but this film had a very special significance for me in 1957 i was the same age as homer hickham like him i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness like homer also i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel and like homer i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster what fun it was br br i didn't achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though but that's what you find out when you see this movie br br sure it's a basic family movie but that's a dying breed these days it seems take the time to see it with the kids you'll all have a lot of good laughs
<START> after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch we stumbled on this it looked appealing from the summary at least so we gave it a try and here's the kicker the first 20 minutes are interesting it's actually enjoyable oh wait spoke too soon br br somewhere in there the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental right wing christian brain washing not entirely sure what happens but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there finished writing this script and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood wasn't clean br br can they put warnings on this i refuse to support this religious idiocy much like video games have rating systems movies need some sort of symbol maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse br br unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll convert your neighbors don't waste your time it's some of the worst junk that's come out in a very long time and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding
<START> i could only get through about 25 mins of it not one laugh in the 25 minutes i gave it one of the most painful films i've ever had to endure chris kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him just a horrible movie
<START> this film really disappointed me the acting is atrocious unbelievable and it's about actors the story is incredibly obvious a group of independent actors stage a passion play and in turn they start to live out the lives of the characters they play i've been watching a lot of movies lately thanks to netflix and this is the first one i haven't watched all the way through in a long time i felt i didn't need to see the end we all know the end of this story br br for some it seems this modernization of the gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening i cannot speak to any of this as i wasn't raised in the christian church that being said i was raised in the us and i live in an increasingly christian culture i'm curious enough about jesus and about the modernization of the religion for better or worse i haven't seen mel gibson's version but i'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this except for the most conservative i just wish this was a better film br br lots of these reviews praise arcand's direction and especially the cinematography i liked neither the film itself is rather prudish and preachy i didn't believe the characters' personae and i was never involved with their on screen lives the play within the play is very much dated and would not i think carry it's own weight in a real time production but that's beside the point what i really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about and the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal br br there were two examples of this that come easily to mind firstly there is a reenactment of the parable of jesus driving the money lenders from the temple the lead actor who has fallen for the woman who will play magdalene and who is also a model and dancer becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience with her pants off he trashes the place and chases them all out i guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach the romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high school rendering of death of a salesman i e not well please stop hitting me over the head with this high handed significance the other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who eventually turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays corrupt church why why does she sleep with this guy it brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain ah the saintly whore and the lovable old coot it seems to be just enough for arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters they are going through the motions and i'm reaching for the eject button br br feel free to write me off as bored jaded or just not interested feel free to watch this movie and see the passion in all its beauty sadness and inspiration delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel but don't say i didn't warn you
<START> another horror flick in which a goof ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over yes but the fact that this one was from canada gives it a slightly different feel the brain has troublesome teenager jim majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly brain can jim stop him i guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie but still they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all br br the bad guy had a brain why didn't the people who made this movie
<START> credited by variety to be one of the greatest documentaries to ever come out of canada al pacino roger ebert neil simon matt dillon as well as a constant slew of celebs make this film a canadian classic the film is really best described as roger me meets the player watch as kenny hotz and spenny pitch their script to the big boys of hollywood called the only american film to ever come out of canada this film opened the toronto film festival in 1997 winner of the 'best indie film award toronto' europe premier was at the prestigious hof film fest in germany u s a premier u s comedy festival aspen 1999 more information available at www kennyhotz com
<START> clean family oriented movie i laughed i cried i loved it i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office boy was i wrong he should win an oscar for his performance i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this type i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest only 1 cuss word not even sure why it was pg13 i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy drama romance and more
<START> the 60s 1999 d mark piznarski josh hamilton julia stiles jerry o'connell jeremy sisto jordana brewster leonard roberts bill smitrovich annie corley charles s dutton nbc mini series later released to video dvd as full length feature film about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family the film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families however dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half rating 4 out of 10 not rated later rated pg 13 for video dvd release
<START> i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and language br br which correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and language br br the word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non existent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated story wise it was so so after all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i don't br br of course this is only my opinion br br joseph
<START> watched both parts twice enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the lady in distress alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces she didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older age is inevitable but let's not hide from it a man at 50 can be much sexier and patrick truly is sexy then a green youth no matter how pretty hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile
<START> this is not so much film as big budget children's television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'insomnia' when it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that's not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive
<START> i was very disappointed with this film i expected more of a thelma and louise female buddy crime movie instead the women prison escapees in this flick had no sense of loyalty to one another they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas who beat each other up double crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film br br instead of being shrewed thieves who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money the women escapees were too selfish and vicious to trust each other for long these women weren't liberated in a positive sense they just ended up being a bunch of loose cannons incapable of respect for themselves or each other if you like 70s female crime caper films skip this bomb and see the great texas dynamite chase which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones
