<START> after garbo's introduction to sound in clarence brown's anna christie jacques feyder made a german version of the movie where all of the cast except for garbo were different while the american version is still more available in the usa and most of the american viewers have primarily seen this version the germna anna christie is more likely to be viewed in europe as i have seen both films i feel the right to compare the two closely knit productions is jacques feyder's film different is it better than clarence brown's br br in this analysis i would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common they have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park however when emphasizing garbo herself i address the first difference she does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking the viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers garbo was very good in american film and she is also very good here yet to me she seems even more genuine in the german version it is noticeable that garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was artificially created by the sensation garbo talks her german is not very well pronounced yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood therefore i can easily say the same i did in my american version comment skaal greta garbo br br yet the film differs in one very important issue the rest of the cast here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure the differences are filled with varieties salka viertel or salka steuerman garbo's lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as marie dressler in the role of marthy owens she is not bad she is different sometimes overacts from today's perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as marie dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time some people even claim that dressler was better than garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth theo shall is more sympathetic as matt than charles bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks br br who shines in the german anna christie who is really worth greatest attention is hans junkermann in the role of chris christopherson anna's father george f marion vs hans junkermann is like a day vs night difference junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter the scene of anna's first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of chris' conversation with marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance junkermann is the chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind great br br if you have seen the american anna christie and have a chance to get the german version i would highly recommend to you this movie because it's a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to clarence brown's movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance hans junkermann's skaal or prost hans junkermann
<START> imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid friendly or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn't cuss so that his specials could be rated pg in the same way the director of the movie something wicked this way comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book in trying to make the story of something wicked this way comes easier for children to follow the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone and good always prevailing over evil this is apparent in will's character transformation charles halloway's rescue of jim and the carnival's defeat br br will's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie the scene in which the dust witch visits will's house in a balloon has been cut from the film instead a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own he gets on top of a neighbor's roof and tears the balloon with a bow defeating the witch sorry dad he thought and sat up smiling this time it's me out alone will decides as he prepares to face her 147 removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim but never growing curious like his friend in the book will has both a good quiet side and an evil daring side like his jim in the movie each boy only has one mode of thought which destroys bradbury's theme of both good and evil being present in each person br br in the book will saves jim because of their friendship but in the movie charles halloway saves jim to repay jim's father will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury's novel because he doesn't want his best friend to grow up without him it is the good in will the fact that he cares about his friend that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival on the carousel jim gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind the one part of him the small white separate part that still remembered their friendship 269 this shows that there was good left inside of jim which has the potential to still defeat evil but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie he does it to repay the debt he owes jim's father who saved will when he was a little boy by changing the motivation for saving jim the filmmakers have ruined bradbury's original idea that it takes good to win against evil br br in the end of the movie the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter when the book ends mr dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can't stand it and evaporates in bradbury's world evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love his message is that good will always prevail over evil but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly good to evil seems evil says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr dark so i will do only good to you jed i'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself 275 in the movie mr dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it and he dies by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil as if lightning only strikes those who are bad this takes away the major theme of bradbury's book which is that doing good toward others wards off evil br br good may always triumph over evil but trying to make movies more kid friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on in the movie something wicked this way comes will does not transform will's friendship does not save jim and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival as a result the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury's main points the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established in the case of this story bradbury's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer simpler version of itself
<START> so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because it's independent doesn't mean it gets a free pass if you're going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a well written score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp can't save this one it's one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved
<START> a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made despite some of the acting outdated dialogue etc br br first there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell a humanoid race native to the planet now all dead who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans us and their technology particularly the 8 000 cubic mile machine br br second there is the music and sound effects which are inseparable from each other it creates an eerie unearthly feeling unlike 2001 which had traditional classical music br br third its monster is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and biology br br finally and most importantly forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and more incredibly succeeds in making an honest intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human or any other biological entity's development no matter how long we survive as a species br br in other words it predicts our inevitable destiny
<START> when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing brooding atmosphere and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat masterpiece of a film although with most modern movies extremely enjoyable as some are those that really shock you into focus are the strongest and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly stick with you for a life time i say proudly that i am a fan of movies that disturb not just horror movies but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding movies like breakdown and the missing that send a chill down your spine making you think holy crap that could happen to me and visually entice you are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie because i am only 21 i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds jon voight and ned beatty albeit i am familiar with them i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long i must say after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies burt renyolds plays lewis the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made filling the whole wilderness in water renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer sort of no nonsense and filled with machismo witnessing him portray the tough guy made me think differently about him as an actor as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers drew and bob respectively joining in for the fun of a canoe trip the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight once again i have only seen him as an older actor however unlike renyolds i have quite liked voight's acting and i don't regard anaconda when i say that for example the national treasure movies voight plays ed whom like lewis is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character a reluctant hero leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to like the imbred kid who plays the infamous duelling banjo's at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene as with all atmospheric movies from this moment on dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival the film's cinematics do not let up and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him cocks his rifle only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film in wrapping up deliverance is one film who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date remains one of the best films in cinematic history
<START> have to admit this version disgraces shakespeare upfront none can act except the nurse who was my fav juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her she's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion god stop whining i would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up anthony andrews yikes considering his other great movies brideshead revisited ivanhoe scarlet pimpernel he's quite a shocker in this one and don't get me started on romeo puhleasssssee it's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every romeo and juliet ever made in the history of film olivia and leonard's version is still the best followed by leslie howard's version and then the current leo and clare
<START> mad dog' earle is back along with his sad sack moll marie and that fickle clubfoot velma so are babe and red doc and big mac and even the scenery chewing mutt pard the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh's high sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original instead of walsh we get stuart heisler for humphrey bogart we get jack palance for ida lupino shelley winters and so on down through the credits the only change is that this time instead of black and white it's in warnercolor sadly there are those who would count this an improvement br br i died a thousand times may be unnecessary Â and inferior Â but at least it's not a travesty the story still works on its own stagy terms earle palance fresh out of the pen near chicago drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney jr Â knocking over a post mountain resort en route he almost collides with a family of oakies when he's smitten with their granddaughter the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as winters who throws herself at him as does the pooch biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel palance to winter's chagrin offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity a gesture that backfires then the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath on the lam palance moves higher into the cold sierras br br it's an absorbing enough story competently executed that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 the year bogie with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon became a star and one last heretical note those mountains do look gorgeous in color br br
<START> nintendo you ers how could you do this to me i can't believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along oh god where do i even begin the plot sucked the voice acting sucked the animation sucked the ending really sucked if you liked this movie you suck too and to futuramafan1987 who said this was the greatest movie ever you are a tool plain and simple this isn't a movie for anyone but crack addled ten year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god i'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie and then there was pikachu's adventure don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film it is in all truth one of the most boring experiences of my entire life don't go watch this at any costs br br bottom line go out find every copy of this movie that you can and burn it burn them all and then proceed to rent a good movie like aliens or bowling for columbine or even back to the future
<START> anurag basu who co directed the flop kucch to hai made his debut in this film br br the film was ahead of it's times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to hawas which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better business br br the movie starts off well malika's guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with emraan malika is too crude vulgar br br the scenes between emraan and malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where ashmith confronts emraan is brilliant br br the pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of emraan isn't fully convincing br br also the cop track seems half baked br br the finale is too filmy too br br direction by anurag basu is good music is a winner all songs were fab camera work was stunning br br emraan played his naughty streak very well this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb ashmith too was good in his role for once he did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films raj jhutsi is okay
<START> when i first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago i loved it i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent as is the music but it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more i find emma thompson's writing self absorbed and unfaithful to the original book she has reduced marianne to a side character a second fiddle to her much too old much too severe elinor she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments' and often they appear to be there just to show off thompson herself br br i do understand her cutting off several characters from the book but leaving out the one scene where willoughby in the book is redeemed for someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie those are the things always difficult to digest br br as for the actors i love kate winslet as marianne she is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully without too much sentimentality alan rickman is great a bit old perhaps but he plays the role beautifully and elizabeth spriggs she is absolutely fantastic as always
<START> ok ok it might be hard to put the entirety of a man's life in one film traditionally therefore biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject's life now byron was a my week beats your year fellow which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder furthermore just as byron's poetry is inseparable from his life the man's life itself must be seen as a whole lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture it's showing a different picture altogether br br now in short my review comes down to this supposedly byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime true he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in but in the end this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we'd all want to lead no well i did not at any moment want to live the life depicted in this film so it gets 3 not for being so badly done which direction wise it more or less was but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot br br some more detail well to over simplify things a byron bio should have two distinct episodes 1 post first europe trip england and his rise to fame marriage 2 his life abroad now the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first not only was it a lot longer but the most significant change in byron took place then furthermore it's where he created his best works don juan the vision of judgement etc all the stuff that makes him really unique in english literature br br instead in this film a byron's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining b it only gets worse after he leaves england they did two good jobs first they started at his return of his europe trip though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue second they chose an angle and they chose his incestuous love for augusta who is rather perfectly cast the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go true byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life but especially as he was such a mood swing person the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life br br anyway the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england there's no doubt about that the thing is once abroad a life of debauchery began with the infamous geneva period but in italy byron also discovered a new life both for his poetry inspired by italian comedy already in venice and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna afterwards at the request of shelly with teresa to pisa in other words he was also liberated his mind and life opened up and not only in the decadent sense while england's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age true freedom was augusta less but this bitter sweet freedom tastes sour in this film we see a lonely bored snob getting older br br i mean hell byron never thought much about his poetry except when he finally found his own voice in don juan apart from poetic and romantic developments his relationship with shelly and the down break should have been more documented also it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas this is important as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted in life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan life and work are one true still a bit naive but it's what got him to greece and the whole thing came full circle in pisa where shelley's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark missolonghi wasn't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action it was the insights in italy the gambas stirring him into action it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism but it wasn't just that there was a true inspiration behind it meanwhile byron wrote massive amounts of don juan true his end is a bit sad but it's not like he's worn out that is the essence of byron's life he may have had some strong emotional attachments 2 augusta and teresa but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly meaning that he wasn't 'less' at the end of his life no he'd made a physical and mental journey that at the time few people were prepared to make br br i wonder why is it that so often the second period in byron's life is overlooked because it had less obvious conflicts as the man was finally coming to his own in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time which byron so despised and which despite the fact that he had no choice he willingly fled in 1816 to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause
<START> after seeing the trailer for evening you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved i mean they even got rocky horror's own brad barry bostwick to show the world he is still acting and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie while not entirely true the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer and that isn't necessarily a bad thing this is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifeÂthe one that got away her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and harris killed buddy soon plays out no matter what happens though the film is not about these people and what they do good or bad it is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life what may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen br br the story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present ann on her deathbed dreamstate ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind and the past ann meeting harris at her best friend's wedding there are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring but overall it is handled better than at first thought it's not as though ann's life now is uninteresting it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned while i grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for ann's children currently i was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as i maybe should have there are some nice moments though for instance the crash that awakens ann from slumber being mirrored later on and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together br br it is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid these performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when our time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next no matter how annoying i find claire danes' angry sad crying face that exists in every role she plays the girl is good at what she does i find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing patrick wilson is always great in whatever i've seen him in you must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year from angels in america to last year's little children the guy will soon blow up but hopefully he will stay true to the craft and not cash in heck even mamie gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother meryl streep who surprisingly is in the film very little she is still rough around the edges but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day the real revelation though is hugh dancy i feel i've seen him in many things but in fact it seems only in king arthur dancy literally steals every scene he is in and the way in which his role of buddy is devastated by love alcohol life is etched in his facial expressions throughout without his performance the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse br br while not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table you may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together but you can't argue that the acting isn't worth sticking around for maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see however when it is all put together there may also be something coming out of it that couldn't have been achieved without all the other story threads either way the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it
<START> julie waters is outstanding and adrian pasdar a revelation in a very warm very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executive's life at the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you
<START> the movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made i've watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless br br and the film has some gem lines scenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you i've been out of high school for uhhh some years and it's not following me the famous static line i'm getting some static not as much as you're going to get as principal togar approaches the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses the nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before cd's and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you're ramones br br just one piece of advice don't look up where the stars are now joey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all age pj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele br br so watch and enjoy don't think just have fun
<START> the feel of this movie was amazing adam sandler's performance was very inspiring as he played a very rattled and fragile character he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role his character was really interesting i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me for someone who plays primarily comedy roles he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input i especially loved the scene in which adam and don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city i familiarized with the moment because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all with his video games music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts this movie is definitely worth the watch
<START> i love john saxon in anything he's in the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled please do not watch this movie called zombie death house the 1000 dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70's cheese legend ray being the front man at retromedia ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon just plain bad now the both of them and boring besides it's great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house the word zombie sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f o r the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon if you wanna see real saxon pick up black christmas nightmare on elm street or the glove
<START> rock star john norman howard kris kristofferson turns lounge singer esther hoffman barbra streisand into an overnight singing star esther's star rises while john's goes into decline thanks to drugs and alcohol after about two hours john does the self destructive red converible 160 mph crack up on a desert highway thing the best thing about this movie is the music especially the song evergreen barbra streisand sings well but you can't take her seriously as an up and coming star when she is already a star the very first time she appears singing in a back alley bar she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career she is too confident too professional her apartment looks like a page out of apartment living not some hole in the wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live br br kris kristofferson handles the self centered out of control rock star role like well like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent the direction is tepid the story is slow and dull br br but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story it's the hair after staring at kristofferson's and streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2 hours your eyes hurt
<START> i liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much longer story since the book is over 400 pages that makes sense it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional south american country also a lot to fit into the time available i think it would have been much better as a six hour mini series than it turned out as a 140 minute movie br br even though it's rushed the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing what is told is told fairly well one fault is that clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie or they should have been left out two more faults which could be spoilers esteban's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and ferula's curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever br br the acting is excellent glenn close as the tormented spinster ferula is outstanding jeremy irons as the brutal self made rich man is also excellent meryl streep as the main character clara is great although she's often even better than she was in this movie there were many well performed smaller roles too the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent
<START> review may contain spoilers br br predictable campy bad special effects it has a tv movie feeling to it the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible the premise is interesting but its excution falls waaaay short if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this at least make it a quality one i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago and there isn't really much to say about this film other than skip it
<START> a very strong movie bruce is good and brad also br br as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered br br that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job br br well novikov property seems to me work in this movie however i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity br br so bruce could save the world but not his world br br in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself br br and i do believe there is no problem in that here i disagree with dr brown from back br br but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor his girlfriend was just lost br br a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future the bullet well it might be some mistake some falsification br br well i like this movie has to buy a dvd br br best
