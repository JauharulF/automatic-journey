<START> while others may contend that by viewing other works by bilal one will better appreciate this movie it does fail in one major way it does not stand on its own the plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance here's an idea start with a definite story then craft symbolism around it we start with two different narratives this female that is somehow turning human a god that is for some reason being judged but getting one last fling on earth and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the bounds of the city why none of these questions are answered but do we care no there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive which it is but at the expense of motivic development i would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture
<START> first of all i too was expecting another hero a fantastic work of art for the action genre i've only seen parts of crouching tiger hidden dragon but i can imagine that it is better than hofd br br basic elements from hero are found in hofd great landscapes mesmerizing cinematography and sincere acting i mean if you can't understand a word they are saying without the subtitles but you still care that's good acting br br what went wrong what begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story worse it's a soap opera like love triangle you have three characters who i guess fall in love with each other for no good reasons this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail i fell asleep about forty minutes into it it's almost as if they changed writers at that point the remainder of the movie is about how a character is like the wind ick also you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces this isn't unique to this genre but since the story is weak you can't wait for the action and then when the fighting does breaks out it really wasn't that good the beginning grabs you but then this movie just runs out of gas
<START> mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90' mark the beautiful sets are here with all that made the hamer production values a trademark yet paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect the story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5 of your attention to be expected br br the directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play actors are mostly stiff as wax figures ok this is a hamer feature only it's sometimes better featured in the whole package my conclusion this movie is trash not worth the time i spend that evening eternal life is a boring matter and i should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the cinemathÃ¨que would have known better
<START> i found this movie to be charming i thought the characters were developed since as i watched i found myself caring about these people this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression a single mother who is known as the town recluse she has reason to be puts an ad in the paper for a husband christopher reeve plays a ex con who happens into town looking for work he sees the ad and he goes out to see her she hires him i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes everything went on so matter of fact he needs the work so he doesn't want to upset her and she needing his help but doesn't want him to get the upper hand they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other things start warming up until the big blowup i won't spoil it by telling you what happens but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful i found the story to be very believable for the time it's taking place i think this is one of the better relationship stories out there maybe the younger generation won't get it but if you are over 40 i think you'll like it and if you liked christopher reeve in somewhere in time you'll like him in this one also
<START> saw this film in august at the 27th annual national association of black journalists convention in milwaukee wi it's first public screening the film is great derek luke is wonderful as antwone fisher this young actor has a very bright future the real antwone fisher did a great job writing the film and denzel's direction is right on the money see it opening weekend you won't be disappointed
<START> here is a favorite tom jerry cartoon perfect for halloween i know it dosen't have much creepiness but has the 'trick' as in trick or treat as jerry did to tom with the window blind and the vacuum cleaner with a collared shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost but still like to put it on my list of halloween cartoons in this short tom was listening to the witching hour a ghost story program on the radio and being frightened by the horror story being told halfway into the story the dramatics hair standing on end heart leaping into throat icy chills on spine begin happening to tom literally and jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself thought he highen tom fears by scaring him br br i love the ending it was a little funny and you know this short is the first of four cartoons in which tom attacks mammy two shoes the others being the lonesome mouse a mouse in the house and nit witty kitty and also this short is the first of twenty five cartoons where tom speaks the others are the lonesome mouse the zoot cat the million dollar cat the bodyguard mouse trouble the mouse comes to dinner quiet please trap happy solid serenade mouse cleaning texas tom mucho mouse and the cat above and the mouse below directed by chuck jones
<START> to me this just comes off as a soap opera i guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered social commentary but in the final analysis i simply don't care how you characterize this film none of the characters are very likable or engaging i felt no chemistry between hudson and bacall if there is a love story here it is lost in the malaise and despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate and therefore incomprehensible reversal by dorothy maguire on the witness stand the story is insufficient to hold my interest no matter how much freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in this story is sleazy melodramatic and trite br br rock hudson is nobly wooden this is lauren bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performances but her character is vile and his is pathetic robert keith as the loving out of touch father of two miscreant adult children is the most sympathetic character most interesting of all however is the severe looking robert wilke in a small role as the bar owner he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless westerns but here he is an honest likable fellow br br i take my social commentary with an interesting engaging story and a few likable characters thank you
<START> i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality capturing the essence of high school high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter
<START> with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr and that ilk my son was bugging us to see it between dvd and the theaters i've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding incredibles shrek to the really bad wall e brother bear but this was easily the worst movie i've ever seen kids or no kids it was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience ok it's aimed at toddlers or it better be it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 but i've never seen something so predictable repetitive and slow moving then once you're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there isn't one it's serious though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish the 3 d effects yeah if you've never seen a viewmaster they're a big deal otherwise no if you look at the screen without glasses it appears to be the same process even my son was bored by the end both my wife and i looked at each other and said wow at the end bad in every respect
<START> though this series only ran a season it has stayed with me for 20 years it was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever i would give nearly anything to have it on dvd or whatever format i can get if you find any means of seeing this series i suggest you take full advantage this series was the first one in my opinion that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes it also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them heck the character goose actually scared me sometimes he was just that odd at the time also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of clint eastwood tommy lee jones if anyone has any way of contacting the creator holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on dvd please by all means do so
<START> okay i'm not going to critique this film in depth i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de medeiros i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner groan anyway let the elogious voices override me but for other cinephiles like me beware br br expressed in simplest and gentlest terms here's my stance br br the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life via newspapers i read daily in my local middle european pub at that time i followed the newsreports but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring the reporters tended to report either in non partisan terms or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris berlin prague and various places in the u s all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time but dictatorship or not my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment not as a well fleshed out evil empire to use flippant star war terms br br so week after week i read of disturbances but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them or evaluate the practices and social economic impacts of the dictatorship etc br br so in purchasing this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest and to enjoy a well conceived drama this film gave me neither br br the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama well as i said i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry but it was trite and shallow br br i obtained my copy of the dvd from france selection official cannes 2000 un certain regard the box shows smiling clean shaven actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it though as a shallow piece of cinema verite' with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty but br br look at the back of the box un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution a warm regard try describing allende's overthrown and murder with a a warm regard try it with czechoslovakia in 1968 try it with the whole line up of overthrows and civil rebellions br br another review maria de medeiros a renoue' avec son pays son enfance et son histoire rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for me br br i love portugal in all of europe lisbon barcelona and prague are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country doesn't flesh out a vacuous film i'll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa meanwhile i'm stuck with a zone 2 by the above title that might as well go in the trash
<START> just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level this is a rebirth for motion capture neither movie nor cartoon this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir akira sin city blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists you see paris the way it almost could be the characters seem as real as you and i they blink trip shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before br br don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers but this definitely is bliss for the eyes
<START> i thought the river of souls was a very good babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from martin sheen tracy scoggins and ian macshane if this were an episode of the series without the humour it would probably be one of my favourite stand alone stories of the series br br personally i've always preferred scoggins to christian although granted jms didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron telepath plot if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all
<START> now i really liked this movie it was so funny both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future br br akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future john abraham plays his best friend he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor i just love john neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well br br the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone
<START> the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues those staged performances usually musical that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days must deal with crooked competition fraudulent partners unfaithful lovers amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade br br while closely resembling other warner's musical spectaculars notably the golddigger films this movie had a special attraction none of the others had jimmy cagney he is a wonder loose jointed and lithe as agile as any tomcat a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie cagney grabs the viewers attention never lets go powering the rapid fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma buoyant charm br br the rest of the cast gives their best as well joan blondell is perfect as the smart mouthed big hearted blonde secretary infatuated with cagney major quibble why wasn't she given a musical number dick powell ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage off the fact that her singing acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead br br guy kibbee hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers in law both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways ruth donnelly scores as kibbee's wealthy wife a woman devoted to her handsome protÃ©gÃ©s frank mchugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney's wit herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger mavens will spot little billy barty jimmy conlin maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers br br finally there's busby berkeley choreographer nonpareil his terpsichorean confections sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy the big joke about berkeley's creations of course was that they were meant as part of the plot to be stage productions but no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera br br berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches either a story often rather bizarre told with song dance or else stunning geometrically designed numbers eye candy featuring plentiful chorus girls overhead camerawork a romantic tune in a spasm of outrÃ© extravagance footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks honeymoon hotel' and its pre production code telling of a couple's wedding night by a waterfall' dozens of unclad females splashing floating diving in perfect patterns designs peer closely you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved and finally shanghai lil' a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney berkeley
<START> john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and is sure he'll be a burden to everyone the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can't get through to him neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker he's stubborn and blinded by his own fears self pity and prejudices it's a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama the best scenes are on guadalcanal where he's in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane dark glasses and holding out a tin cup all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera
<START> spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone br br this movie really annoyed me it has a great looking monster has some good low budget effects some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd br br the problems with this movie are many first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school you don't believe anything from the get go as a result the scarecrow while looking great isn't much beyond that he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary is this a comedy or a horror movie its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up it seems more send up of every clichÃ© than heartfelt horror film i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it br br despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks you're paying too much br br avoid
<START> actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university but nobody in usa has heard of it which is a real shame the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad they are stuck together on a long bus trip someplace most of us have been but i never had one like this br br my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral then the man woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way the consumptive starts hacking they realize everybody is watching talk about surprised but you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did serb humor at it's best
<START> this movie has great stars in their earlier years ingor stevens never looked prettier yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the united states charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson but some moments were a bit stilted it's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each other sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen i love it every time
<START> what why are people saying this is mind blowing just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography 4 left and the whole world has ended not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed 1 was right the whole time if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what to make it rain i admit the movie had it's parts and the whole concept was fascinating but a lot of it was clichÃ©s one after another and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like lord of the rings characters died for stupid reasons there was almost no character development and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world its pointless and stupid it was one of the shortest movies i've ever seen and thank god how is robots turning against humans creative in any way it's been done like a hundred times this movie is really stupid go see a movie that's worth watching like star trek the hangover or inglorious basterds those were good movies
