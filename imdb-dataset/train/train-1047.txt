<START> kim basinger stars as della a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces she finds out the owners of the car are the rainbow coilition of villains comprising of a white guy a mexican a chinese guy a black they confront her about the note cap a helpless security guard and the chase is on during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner bronson br br i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller the acting was good enough except for a few scenes the why god why bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases from after are mind numbingly stupid if they hadn't had the intellect of any given home alone baddie perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes the unbelievability factor i'm willing to overlook as both the director one of the producers had part in bringing shoot em up to the screen a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun this film while never attaining the heights of that film was good in it's own rights br br my grade c br br anchor bay dvd extras commentary with writer director susan montford and producer don murphy a 25 and a half minute 'making of' a trailer two tv spots for this film and trailer for lower learning
<START> both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie if you don't buy rent it for a good time
<START> was this a comedy or was it a drama i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed hollywood shuffle was neither funny or rather dramatic while it tried so hard to make a point because of this lack of definition comedy or drama the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in hollywood even today i do not believe that townsend's directorial debut did much to stop it instead i feel it only added more fuel to the fire townsend's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of he was instead promoting and vice versa the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy townsend had a decent concept with this film but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film if you watch the preview before the film which i constantly do you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers but the actually film could not be further from the truth br br the main problem with hollywood shuffle is not story itself because it is lacking in elaboration it is townsend's direction he had a wonderful concept with this film exploit the hollywood that exploits our race decent idea but why couldn't he execute it very well the first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital we are literally everywhere without any warning or map it was obvious that townsend had quite a bit to say but only a short amount of time to do it in so instead of defining his characters developing his themes and actually creating a smart film he just throws it all together and prays that it works sadly it doesn't instead of a smart comedy we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas comedic skits and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable what hurts townsend the most are his brief attempt to be funny interruptions throughout the film from battling a villain known as jerry curl to parodying siskel ebert townsend's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters this is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally while townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and clichÃ© in the book what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest br br so if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story wrong the wayans are in this film but townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family definitely in their pre in living color moments we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon perhaps it was townsend's direction or just maybe this atrocious story but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film i just thought that with the talent pool that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny bright and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma sadly it was none of the above br br finally i would like to say that this was a workable film there were some moments while they were few and way far between that had a smile on my face the final product just didn't settle well with me townsend can be funny but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself instead of through his personal experiences and troubles i realize that he was probably speaking the truth but it never came through as that instead we are threaded through a weak story which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom but surely didn't work for this film even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film i would have to disagree if you are starting fresh either have a tight script or defined themes townsend had neither of these and combined with the inability to control his actors he just failed in a ball of flames br br overall this was rather disappointing to watch it reminded me of a grade school spelling bee where it is finally your child's time to spell the word is tough but as the first two to three letters come out you think that it is going to work perfectly but then there is that random p and silent r that forces your excitement to come tumbling down that is how i felt with hollywood shuffle at first i saw the potential i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes i experienced that deep fall feeling townsend sank his own ship on this one and i don't think hollywood shuffle will ever re submerge as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema br br grade out of
<START> this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff the story line goes something like this a tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day and gets her pocketbook picked by skip mccoy what skip and the dame don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies this opening shot without dialogue and mostly in tight close ups is a beaut one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie playing the babe known as candy is jean peters who was never better nor better looking one forgets how beautiful she was and she handles this role very well the pickpocket is played by richard widmark who had already made his mark and set his style with 1947's kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh and although he's a little softer here he's still scary these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there but its noir and nasty all the way the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter who plays moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral ritter received a well deserved oscar nomination for her performance but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the b girl read prostitute in from here to eternity hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful see for instance shirley jones in elmer gantry set among the docks and dives of new york city with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald and some very good art direction especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmark's shack near the river made at the height of the cold war and red scare the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie played by richard kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal american
<START> an uninteresting addition to the stalk 'n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980's this was filmed as pranks but released as the dorm that dripped blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology the house that dripped blood daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie she has also appeared in the initiation and the fly ii
<START> i had no expectations i'd never heard of jamie foxx all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it i thought it was highly entertaining it was fun the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest to me foxx is an original david morse is terrific true this is not his finest role i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised
<START> sighÂ i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner surely he isn't the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting but so what they're awesomely entertaining his most famous action movies like the first three entries in the death wish series for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres Â like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example Â he doesn't stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd's browning's masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place claim it's an unethical thing to do i don't suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didn't warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz' novel Â and thus michael winner's screenplay Â is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemary's baby the omen and the exorcist but let's face it 70's cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70's horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you're not likely to forget easy br br alison parker a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already alison's physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this it's truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison's brownstone apartment is the earth's gateway to hell itself and she's the chosen one to guard it because the film's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly 75 minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison's own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fiancÃ©e's odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like alison's flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements i ever witnessed br br the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn't the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff goldblum beverly d'angelo and tom berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics
<START> plot synopsis when his wife a news reporter is kidnapped replaced with an android double secret service agent eric phillips tracks her down uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders br br i wasn't expecting much when i first saw this sequel to richard pepin's low budget sci fi action hybrid cyber tracker that film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip off of both the terminator robocop this sequel is the same as before with an all out action sequence opening the film there are plenty of explosions heavy gunfire a huge bodycount as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the film's star don the dragon wilson the whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot on the acting front wilson is a bad actor he really needs a personality transplant
<START> good folks i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers my academic specialty is anglo saxon literature and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves the icelandic beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen and i did pay 3 00 for my copy this sci fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version yuck br br what didn't i like cgi for one amazingly bad more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting i am used to both with all the versions i have seen br br delighted regardless peter
<START> i don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot you've seen the trailer and if you haven't its online i don't recommend seeing it though it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance it's really funny i was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20 this however is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film which is normally the case everyone gives a great performance especially joan cusack and there are some really great moments throughout i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing
<START> how this has not become a cult film i do not know i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy br br runaway car attempts to pass itself off as a fast paced thriller but taking the quality of acting good god it's bad the storyline the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh and laugh you will films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth this film is the pinnacle in entertainment i laughed from beginning to end at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked it really is that funny at some points when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces i was laughing hysterically but when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree tears were running down my face br br it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's like a prayer video he seems to get everywhere
<START> how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together well i couldn't and so i rented this mess of a movie br br i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man's legend i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow not because the story is complicated but because it is slow even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters br br though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history considering how young the country is this is very rare and should be appreciated and the film does have some good actions sequences br br 6 10 see it for historical value yeah right and that's the only reason to see it
<START> one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories farewell my concubine the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films br br in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave trader all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera a regional operatic style related to peking opera fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality
<START> sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino royale our man flint are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens you'll be begging for some peace and quiet 1 2
<START> i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too much br br why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the ex stars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupid br br as for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion i'd like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex smoker that was it on those 2 br br i'd love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it br br very disappointing and really corny
<START> bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it's grotesuque and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this
<START> having set the sitcom world alight with 'father ted' arthur matthews and graham linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called 'hippies' although created by the pair the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone br br set in london in 1969 ray purbs a hippy is the editor of an anarchist magazine his friends are his flat mate the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex his 'girlfriend' is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo br br simon pegg was superb as ray but he is superb in everything he is in this sitcom had a feel of 'citizen smith' about it ray was very much like wolfie smith trying to beat society but failing miserably at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march i can't wait to buy it as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television my memories aren't too good of the sitcom yet i remember two episodes really clearly the first being the opener 'protesting hippies' which i thought was a great start where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was 'hippy dippy hippies' which i think was episode 4 again quite a clear memory about the police sadly the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers i can't think why the bbc commissioned another series but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction oh well i can't wait for the dvd br br best episode hippy dippy hippies series 1 episode 4
<START> yuck and again i say yuck the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it and it had a naked chick on a motorcycle br br this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife br br there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry
<START> clara bow's beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film hula is not quite up to par with clara's best films but it is still enjoyable she dances she rides her horse and pursues the man that she loves this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming gone with the wind the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time if you like clara i would reccomend hula
<START> i frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market and sadly white noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor i was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static induced headache increased i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by michael keaton i was totally unaffected by his demise up until the credits i diligently awaited for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters' story but such relief never came sure there were the occasional heart stopper moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer br br while the acting was lame michael keaton may have played his studliest role to date perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of keaton's abodes overall white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves
