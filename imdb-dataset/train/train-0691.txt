<START> spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point lee's first movie with an all white cast is a major disappointment br br what's the point that italians swear and like funky sex but not with their wives if i wanted to see scorsese i'd go to a scorsese movie the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype br br i've admired several of lee's films especially do the right thing this movie is a waste of time
<START> a high school principal keenan wynn with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman cathy lee crosby but a catalyst for their new winning ways are you really surprised along the way a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player jack michael biehn the police are never notified br br packaged along with other crown international pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere titillation from an r rated film a side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former nba player sydney wicks is the actual reason for the team's new success rather than cathy lee's coaching too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment
<START> awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br zaphoid br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z
<START> i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jackson's trilogy came out but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison the pace of this movie is rushed many important scenes from the book are left out and there is little character development the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over which i found distracting and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished there are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy but if you haven't read the book you'll probably be confused because there is a lot missing from this version 4 out of 10
<START> can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever answer yes and this is one of them after helming the appalling 'house of the dead' director uwe boll has now cast his less than talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation don't these guys get it to anyone who can't understand here it is in block capitals for you video games do not make for good movies the acting here is at best sub standard the set design and special effects are poor unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom no sense of danger or menace pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper the main culprit is the director uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush hackneyed zooms swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets avoid at all costs
<START> seeing moonstruck after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared who knew that cher could act who had ever heard of olympia dukakis nicholas cage was the beginning of his career and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents nor was norman jewison the director br br the only really flat note in this splendid work is when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's amore a song that is sung too many times in the movie once is already too many and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music br br cher is forgive me sensational as loretta castorini a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom aielo johny cammareri obliges by proposing offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother ronny attends the wedding loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him meanwhile her father vincent gardenia is cheating on her mother olympia dukakis which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan opera br br everything works out in the end as it inevitably does in films of this genre in the meantime all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself in its way moonstruck is how hollywood used to be at its best rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever if they'd only lost that's amore along the way it would have been perfect
<START> the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b w photography of the american heartland is stunning we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face in the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment br br the two criminals performed by robert blake and scott wilson as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile is part of the human condition these two delusional men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isn't there once on the run they start writing bad cheques carving out a trail for the authorities br br there are many fine supporting actors i like john forsyth as the detective on the case alvin dewey also will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney br br i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short snatches i did finally get to it after buying the dvd the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen br br don't miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great film making is all about
<START> this is one of the best fred astaire ginger rogers films or at least one of my favorites most of the a r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films br br this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs the music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure she dances also with fred of course and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor br br growing up in the 1950s watching ozzie harriet on television it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty although she had that short early '30s hairstyle i recognized her voice right away also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball i can't find her but i know she's in here br br astaire except for some obnoxious gum chewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and randolph scott although better in westerns is likable too br br this is simply a nice feel good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers
<START> this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that i've seen and so far the funniest one in this one joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman when he goes to warner bros studio the company behind this series incidentally he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused then he encounters actor george o'hanlon who's also mcdoakes who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director i'll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres
<START> the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies the battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron the story of titanic involves two fictional characters leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet from different backgrounds one is a hobo artist the other is an aristocrat and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on br br first of all although using a historical name this movie had little regard to history the plot was built around two fictional lovers french diamond and treasure hunters the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background many historical facts were simply forgotten where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is br br the overall plot was rather shallow rich equals greed and corruption poverty equals compassion and heroism it is very ironic to spend 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts there was absolutely no human side shown in anti heroes it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil casting was also very poor if dicaprio was 2 inches shorter than winslet you could swear she was his baby sitter the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse hearing corny pick up lines such as i see you and this is my side of the ship generated more pain than the screams of drowning people also jokes were too abundant and rather lame br br titanic did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original the best thing about this film were its special effects and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award br br although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo dicaprio and so the movie became a success now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture so it seems that titanic did achieve something after all
<START> i'm not a john cleese completist although i thought fawlty towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences i've ever had the writing is typical english goon show schtick in fact as an audio skit this wouldn't be out of place on a firesign theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates strange case into the kind of jaw dropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics br br the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here cleese's portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the arkin's and seller's inspector clouseau however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film i'd never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as i'm concerned br br some people might not care for strange case especially if british whimsy isn't their cuppa tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight
<START> seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd syriana was one in which i did give up half way through i turned it off in bored disgust br br this movie is disjointed boring confusing and lackluster the acting was dry and without credible portrayals the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award
<START> my take a funny take on the lion king posing as a sequel surprisingly amusing br br surprisingly lion king 1 1 2 is actually another funny straight to video that's worth a theatrical treatment i don't see why disney released this straight to video and release crappy movies like chicken little and return to neverland theatrically those movies are better off seen in the video stores in the new releases area rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters br br this one is merely a spoof of the first film although the events in simba's pride hasn't taken place yet on timon voiced by nathan lane and pumbaa's voiced by ernie sabella point of view we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film original voices from the first film like matthew broderick woopie goldberg cheeche martin and robert guillaume return to their voicing roles from the first film while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as timon's mom and grumpy uncle br br so doesn't this sound fun maybe not now but go watch it for yourself the fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable it's kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaa br br video movie rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because i'd heard that it did not get great reviews however i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky is br br there was no bad acting at all in the whole film every single character is believable the romantic moments between cruise's character david aames and cruz's character sophia are tear jerkingly realistic and intimate probably due to the fact that they were a soon to be real life couple br br the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending however ends are tied up towards the end leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness shock and empathy for david aames br br the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout this isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second br br i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple shallow films
<START> the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season having said that it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit 1967 to an outer space setting with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666 these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self confidence establishing her as a not quite equal yet but getting there partner with our beloved time lord also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay which decreases the occasional over reliance on one liners for the doctor and the performances of the entire cast most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane
<START> i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldn't watch it was because of the 'actors' firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and i'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame but that's a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isn't really their fault it's whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in 2003 i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is i'm 17 how can anyone take that seriously don't fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you'll get far more than this movie could ever give
<START> the movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers my what we've done to the planet you might think i hope we get to see other things like this br br that's very rare when you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations it'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't so then you'll hear some more narration watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead it really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk br br i could read tips on how someone set up their camera fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time
<START> i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks the director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i can't believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful br br i am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort
<START> one of boris karloff's real clinkers essentially the dying karloff looking about 120 years older than he was is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo who i think is married if you think i got that from watching the movie you're wrong i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened why because this movie had me lost from two minutes in i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines little is spelled out and much isn't said until towards the end by which time i really didn't care its a dull mess of interest purely for karloff's performance which is rather odd at times to be honest this is the only time i've ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out
<START> this movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film if you can call it that
