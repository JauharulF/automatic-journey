<START> i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect and even fear my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house after all br br i didn't buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry
<START> i just saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival the working title there was 'dog days' the audience reaction was mixed some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film was br br this film isn't for the faint of heart it's like 'happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity there's animal poisoning a strip tease from a senior citizen an orgy'esque' bathouse in a shopping centre anal candle penetration and the molestation of the mentally incompetent br br if any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isn't for you this film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic the banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost glee br br seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here and why should he this film features excellent performances from all involved is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile
<START> after watching this thing then reading the summary on the back of the dvd then thinking back to actual movie i became a bit dizzy i thought maybe i fell asleep and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism where zombies come out of nowhere and vampires who seduce pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny giroux's panties off coo coo ca fat all of them maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution but that actually made it more entertaining in conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity plot character development antagonism subject matter and acting then the entirety of this film it made bloodrayne look like citizen f ing kane
<START> the movie was a suspenseful and somewhat dark look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake connery and fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movie you'd never expect it
<START> i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible i am attempting to watch all things star trek this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved br br shades of grey is the first recap episode in the tng series having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but i noticed how a couple of them were re shot because the film looked better season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me and the actors looked silly like they didn't fit in their own skins br br the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker's life on the enterprise up until this point the data and riker scene in the holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker's authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon then the admiral kicks his a but good this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it let the record show that the st wiki memory alpha claims that imzadi means first and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come br br here is the article http memory alpha org en wiki imzadi by this point in the series production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci fi behemoth it was destined to become watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows a ds9 movie would have been nice too
<START> the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning then immediately start raving about the animation i should have known what that meant br br the main character palme is a good example of the whole movie's problem one minute palme is a humble hero in search of himself the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of br br like all of the characters in the movie palme is poorly defined you do not bond with the characters at all although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities br br new useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie the writer seriously needed to streamline his story perhaps he was trying to be epic but it was simply too much information for a two hour movie however i can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel br br in the last five minutes of the movie i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters the relationships and the whole plot was i touched my companion and he started cracking up too as did a young man seated behind us we tried so hard to control ourselves but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie br br on the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs the animation almost guides you when you don't care about the characters it tells you how to feel
<START> i just came back from el otro playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed the film is very slow moving don't get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films slow to the point of driving you crazy all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film this is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a lick of inspiration i felt nothing for the story or its characters br br el otro was made only for the sake of making a film making it forgetful i would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good argentinian films look for films by sorin
<START> this film has a powerful philosophical ending but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning br br youth alienation in the late 1960's from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman is the obvious theme of zabriskie point neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience a fact that actually enhances the film's message having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them br br this is not a script driven film except for the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with stunning cinematography the beautiful naturalistic images seem other worldly and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria br br i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors many scenes cry out for riders on the storm br br even so i like this film it's different it's unique it is artistic and imaginative and the desert badlands are beautiful br br as the years go by zabriskie point seems more and more attractive it conveys the mood of the late 1960's in america it is amazingly artistic in a bohemian sort of way and the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing
<START> movie didn't have much plot and was uninteresting basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint also it's very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue partially because of the accents but also because words are mumbled
<START> was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst no br br as a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was cute br br i think that it definitely had some room to improve but it tried br br i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer they obviously do not care for eva longoria i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel i think that movies are a matter of opinion the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop br br maybe the cast did not work out maybe there were too many things going on br br i just wanted to speak up for an average movie not a terrible one it could just be a chick flick kind of like the movie the split up or french kiss my husband still talks about those
<START> valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all it's a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
<START> after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one the shop around the corner i was amazed at this movie it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times the acting is so perfect the story is so beautiful that if you haven't seen it i wish to urge you to see it today i'm not against re makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic don't miss it go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today
<START> i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel the characters are truly young mary is a strong match for byron claire is juvenile and a tad annoying polidori is a convincing beaten down sycophant all are beautiful curious and decadent not the frightening wrecks they are in gothic br br gothic works as an independent piece of shock film and i loved it for different reasons but this works like a merchant and ivory film and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like romantic yes but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film one of my all time favorites
<START> i watched dvd 1 only the program proper may have 10 minutes of good information otherwise it's snotty putdowns of religious people it's as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition br br also flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues and they take over the movie it never gets back on topic br br religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings arguments from such victimized people seem irrational and therefore unconvincing br br anti religious people will want more data we don't need to be told that religious people are nutty any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by mid december br br in the best scene the superintendent of fleming's childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations that seems like the most honest part of the movie and it was too short br br if fleming were a bit more self aware he might have a good story in him about his own past current relationship to christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth br br and perhaps he could lend his christ never walked the earth material to a more serious documentarian i'm not studying the writings of saul paul to find out how air tight this all is but a quick browse of wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited br br the bonus interviews are pretty good tho they don't bolster fleming's thesis much sam harris is a good spokesperson for the anti religious pov and he doesn't go light on those other non christian religions harris also has some good and easily google'd interviews on salon com amazon com and samharris org
<START> schizophreniac the whore mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an extreme horror film any sort of acting production storyline fx etc go out the window in an effort to create shock value now don't get me wrong i consider myself a connoisseur of shock films and the sleazier gorier nastier the better but it's still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the film br br schizophreniac chronicles the life of harry russo a drug addicted freak show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy rubberneck he goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people and screaming about how much he hates hoo uhs that's whores for those of you that don't speak new york ese and how he wants to rape them in the ass there are a few weak necrophilia scenes very little gore and some nudity to mix things up a bit but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film br br the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often unintentionally hilarious screaming fits from our main man harry he goes on and on and on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass and it really becomes quite comical after a while in fact i'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo erotic undertone to this film with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his dong hangin' out in all honesty that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some t and a and some full frontal for good measure schizophreniac is mildly amusing as a 1 time watch but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called schizophreniac the whore mangler to be honest the title by far is the best thing about this trash a generous 3 5 10
<START> i've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time i see it it's a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful music br br this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of spain's premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerful br br it's independent movie making at it's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film
<START> this wasn't the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie i'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose it's all a matter of taste personally i don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again i'm not a fan of jerry springer's pathetic daytime talk show i didn't get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if you're in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isn't too painful to sit through this is a good choice
<START> a very unique sci fi animated film and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be better or worse this french film is quite interesting to watch the technique part is innovatory like waking life i recently watched br br it took me quite a long time to get used to the black white style but eventually i love it the sketchlike images are really fancy the contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which i adore it very much br br the whole plot is fine for a sci fi not so intriguing but it's ok like some hollywood's products a giant conspiracy about human's eternity a little bit clichÃ© and the twisted ending is not so convincing some development is just too plain and insipid and the whole movie is too long br br so i think i'm just in love with the style this film shows others are not so good br br about the eternity of life i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one's life and make the world colorful and lively
<START> if you like movies about creepy towns hotels houses states ala the eagles hotel california etc that possess the people that are just passing through read almost any stephen king novel instead if you like the setting of disappearance start by reading king's desperation but also check out the shining salem's lot and needful things br br the crow motif the desert the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired why didn't they just make the film from the desperation novel maybe they approached king and he nixed must be br br susan dey and harry hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years but they're still tv and direct to dvd caliber actors
<START> after having watched koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it i finally had a chance to see it's sequel life in transformation i was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie the philip glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first compared with koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless a watered down version of baraka which is the same idea but done better i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste
