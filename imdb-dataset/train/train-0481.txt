<START> this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes what she does do however is shine when she's on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go getter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one
<START> not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say norm the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes the actors always seem to be fidgetting are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes
<START> vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie vovochka the main character is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood with the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing personally i found actor who played vovochka too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre that's the little flavor i meant all in all i did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience
<START> the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and i'm glad i did br br i wasn't expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then you'll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all it's a good british comedy
<START> astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity in 1936 americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance wwii was still a few years away fred and ginger dance up the town br br the plot is decent but who cares by the way notice the cameo roles for betty grable and a glamorous lucile ball br br a load of irving berlin songs including the famous let's face the music and dance in that scene ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless br br ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred since she had to do all the same moves in step and backwards br br come to think of it fred's voice was nice too the man was effortless in motion br br here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved one kick off the shoes and enjoy the entertainment
<START> you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleese's quick tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
<START> ignoring if possible the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking which seems to be mandatory in australian government funded films the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance that's a far as it goes the rest is simply awful the plot's overburdened with wow symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere a gross example is the giant peach float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory it was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop the peach is given a cursory unexplained wash down at one stage but that's where it ends br br similarly the contrived black spot road sign where steph's parents were killed is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what she's had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual disability and the unending loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian br br the guinness' prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of alan alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi national hiss hiss as a supervisor alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work he implements redundancies until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure no clichÃ© free zones here mate not only this but alan also loses the seductive steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter if you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic don't ask about detail what's the significance of the shaving cream on steph's seductive leg why doesn't the hotel where the couple makes love eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and among other pandemoniums the sheets are regularly soiled quite spectacularly on one occasion summing this movie up in one word avoid avoid avoid
<START> i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the murderer br br the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue in cheek allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments
<START> what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago
<START> journey of hope tells of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope which spirals downward into despair as they travel to switzerland in search of prosperity although this oscar winning film is fairly well crafted it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities much of the film's 1 7 hour run time is get on the bus get off the bus get on the boat get off the boat get in the van get out of the van etc time which could have been better spent or left out completely the story has a predictable conclusion especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants a worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over rated
<START> for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and i guessed all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies br br this film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the viewer got back was almost true suspension of belief when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police you almost believed it was possible br br if you are a fan of some of the better sex farces canadian or not you should definitely seek this one out and the big surprise this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity
<START> i bought a set of 4 dvds for 10 bucks at my local suncoast which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft xi so basically i paid the rock bottom price of 2 50 for this movie if you do the math i can't exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldn't be over 1 000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 1 50 i know it's a low budget film but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork the film blood cult though not very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of effortless especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that figuratively or literally i wouldn't be surprised if the script was off camera as they were performing i said before that i've never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies aren't always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i don't see why any englishman or englishwoman would volunteer to do a home video style schlock flick like this did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing acting and cinematography departments even when you watch a movie like glitter you can't honestly say it looks like a third grader shot those scenes though a third grader could've written the script i've seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and that's no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not a single effort was put into making this movie let's just sum it up like that you get the picture there's a good deal of nudity though that doesn't save it however i must say that girl with the red orange hair who's either naked or wearing a cleavage popping outfit throughout the film is really hot br br my score 1 out of 10
<START> rea sutherland demunn and von sydow in a small role are all brilliant in their performances sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role where he must portray a character whose morality is at first uncertain to the audience as is so often the case with sutherland's characters we must ask is he a villian in this case a minor one or a hero br br this is a disturbing story intelligently told about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people as sutherland's character wryly notes the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions the committee meeting between rea and sutherland's characters after perestroika is enforced with its revelations has enormous emotional impact you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system br br the handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved br br this is a sad but very important film which deserved its showcase on canada's history television
<START> clair denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while nÃ©nette and boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of marseilles our examination of louis trebor in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french swiss border to half way around the world to korea and tahiti again the film begins in mid stream with louis in his sixties coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby denis is in no hurry to move the action along and we must patiently build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son sidney grÃ©goire colin almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache who rejects him as a lunatic shown as a dedicated father of two there are many brief scenes which while seemingly unrelated build up an impression of louis and his milieu ms godard's camera work is exhilarating here the controlling metaphor is louis's heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to tahiti to search for another son not found and where louis's new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old we are accustomed to brief scenes in denis's film which are inexplicable nÃ©nette astride boni feeding with a spoon a drive by shooting of boni's father and then the briefest of images of boni with a gunshot wound in the head a scene of louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of sidney the implication of the last two is a rejection real or imagined by a father kills something indefinable in a son
<START> like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons this movie has humor at different levels i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son both enjoyed the movie busting out laughing quite a few times and my daughter is not much of a sci fi fan the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times the adult level humor that is humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences no baudy or r rated stuff to be found here keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults for example of the adult level humor the martian voices are based on characters of different movies actors the martian pilot blaznee has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson the scientist that of peter seller's dr strangelove the special effects are surprisingly good for this film the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor and the actors actresses play their part well in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box office draw power an excellent example is wayne alexander's vern character i had to write this review the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's nothing on and i'm bored movie
<START> i approach films about talking animals with care for every wonderful one like babe you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound the incredible journey or in the case of cats dogs you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential when i heard about paulie the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence but i found the film a pleasant surprise and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising br br a russian janitor misha vilyenkov tony shaloub gets a job in a research laboratory one day he hears singing coming from the basement and when he investigates he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out misha becomes fascinated with the bird especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing it can talk and not a few phrases either its a parrot you can actually make conversation with br br the parrot is called paulie voiced by jay mohr and recognises a fellow castaway in misha wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story which all began when he was a baby and in the care of marie a five year old girl with a stutter the two of them became birds of a feather ok bad pun br br when marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird they considered sending him away and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly desperate to be reunited with her paulie begins a long journey across america which includes a diverse number of new owners flying great distances and even ending up behind bars of a cage that is br br paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s and although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box office success of babe paulie succeeds on quite a few levels and is an occasional work of striking intelligence br br jay mohr's stand up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie he never plays the part as too smug even if he is a bit of a smart aleck paulie's worldly but he is also naive in his way br br because he's lived a rather sheltered life with marie when he's taken away he has to fend for himself for the first time and when he falls into the hands of different owners they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie which he believes only for those promises to be broken time and again br br paulie is admittedly a little episodic it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie he first winds up in a pawn shop where he is adopted by ivy gena rowlands a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners she sympathises with paulie's situation and drives an rv across america to find marie br br paulie is an occasionally very touching film his scenes with ivy are some of the best wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers the way she instills in him the need for hope is great and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought provoking br br there are things in life you put off because you think you're gonna do them later but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later br br the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart rending moment and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over br br despite the occasional sad moment there are plenty of laughs to be had paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number and paulie even gets to have a romance which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief played by mohr as well that may be the only complaint i have as soon as you get comfortable with one situation the film then moves paulie on to another br br the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny but a little disturbing too i'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film and paulie's diamond robbery is very mission impossible he's caught in the act and shipped off to the lab for animal testing where he's remained ever since br br the story finally comes full circle at the lab where misha vows to help paulie of course they do find marie but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity i was left numb for several minutes paulie may never get the longevity babe has but i believe its an equally brilliant film the same laughs the same flawless effects and the same surprising intelligence br br a minor gem
<START> this film was excellent the emotional power of tom hulce and ray liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart this film shows us that there is still hope in the world if this film had come out at the end of 1988 instead of rain man hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar definitely a must see
<START> this movie is amazing for several reasons harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary groovin' gary is a small town kid who is assumed well liked for his many impersonations when he decides to play olivia newton john in a local talent show for whom he is very passionate gary's actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives this results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast in the second installment harris exploites the struggle between gary and beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for harris' extreme sensitivity with the subject unlike the second installment the orkly kid shows gary as a truly troubled character he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail his secret passion for dressing like olivia newton john distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast the movie is depicted so realistically that like reality it lends itself to many reactions surely one can see gary as a ridiculously pathetic character but may also identify with him as an outcast
<START> this is a pretty ok film yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast ab sd tanuja however the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon not to be confused with the singer kk in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character i thought that a man who can just look at ab keep staring and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor in fact he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar alongside ab for a second time this guy should get more roles he's brilliant br br if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb you already know the plot and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy and the little love angle he shared with what's her face was completely unnecessary but he is a fairly good actor as seen in dch sunjay dutt is cool to watch always and ab what can i say i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world but i know i can definitely compete for the spot br br an interesting watch considering it's bollywood although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like the great escape and bridge on the river kwai
<START> i'm not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern jargon retellings but this film truly peeved me off the original prom night while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece still realized what it was horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience sorry folks but a white knuckle film this was not the scares were cheap and foreshadowed terribly a good example of scare which has been done to clichÃ©d excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film this film couldn't successfully pull that off so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film there needs to be a likable hero or heroine this film doesn't have one the person i most identified with was the head detective his calm demeanor but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have common sense approach to events that occur if you're running from an axe wielding psycho you turn and sprint in the opposite direction not jog whilst looking back ever three seconds gaging the killer's progress only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path if you friend disappears you don't go looking for them alone and if you suspect foul play you tell someone not investigate yourself these clichÃ©s are tired and well overplayed in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular
