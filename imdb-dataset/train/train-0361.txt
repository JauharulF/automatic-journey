<START> a movie made for contemporary audience the masses get to see what they want to see action comedy drama and of course sensuous scenes as well this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family it isn't for eyes of children i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes br br if it is just entertainment you are looking for then this movie has it all the songs are catchy a lavish production i must add br br however the message of the movie is not universal it emphasizes on the idea of karma that is if you do good you will get good and if you do evil you will get evil the fruit of good deeds is good while the fruit of evil is evil br br in real life this is not always true it is well known that most people do not get justice in this world while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end there are many who escape and then there are many people who do good and yet in return they meet with a sorry end br br if you don't care about the message and all you want is an escape from worldly reality this movie is an entertainer alright
<START> i really enjoyed this episode seeing the flash cyborg green arrow and aquaman even though all he did was swim made my eyes widen to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for this sounds a bit off topic but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode this is the thrill i got from watching this episode i wish they had made this episode a little longer like a two hour special because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough now before i bore you unless i already have with my rambling i just want to say smallville is cool again it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole so enjoy this episode who knows when another good one's going to come out catch it again this thursday feb 22 if you missed the first airing
<START> having heard of modesty blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background br br although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written sadly this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise her counterpart nikolaj coaster waldau as the villain miklos did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina
<START> following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a sizable hard core of hard corps of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street 1993 99 was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just cancel but too small to get a case of 'rabid ratings ravings' over br br during the precarious tenure on friday evenings they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas there i've said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious pedantic politically correct preaching br br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off br br our storyÂÂÂ as we join the story we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer lt al giardello has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but 'g' isn't ready to really retire retire yet so instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of 'charm city ' br br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet alive but in a comatose state he is taken to the hospital br br news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead br br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we'll leave that as classified br br in wrapping up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our endorsement as for grading the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode
<START> criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of satan's black wedding criminally insane and it's a good thing too because when i've seen a movie and know there's a sequel especially something that's as obscure as this i'm always curious i've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again most of ci2 is nothing but flashbacks to ci and footage of ethel asleep recalling fond memories i guess thanks to proposition 13 she's released from napa state wonder if she got to see the cramps play while she was there and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that ethel promptly takes to calling granny this is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic and it's even complete with a couple of rolls of course ethel does her thing which is to dispatch anyone between her and food especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert also you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink guess that's all a matter of misguided trust if you liked or disliked criminally insane either way there's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity one wonders why the makers of this even bothered 2 out of 10
<START> i just can't understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge talk about winning the gene pool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his own br br there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together br br ignore the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be euphoric br br ps i am 33 male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess
<START> alright this film is the representation of several things for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries the lead character is what several people who consider a 'loner goth' despite the movie's stating of her not being so she seems quite mysterious but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom she's questioned due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before anyhow she's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospital br br these two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level while alisha is a quiet inwardly disturbed anti social 'goth' girl who spends her time entirely alone even though she seems to read quite often somewhat of a closet out of the closet bookworm the other girl is a rich popular 'bubbly' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most 'cliques' in the modern highschool but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing br br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things either a snobby hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people she's known in other words people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it isn't about that br br this film is about several things while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large life changing catastrophe truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you aren't afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously br br overall this film is one of the best i've ever seen the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing through out this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying this film is by far heart wrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a person's life this would be the first that could have changed mine br br i adored this movie if you ever want a movie that's moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
<START> based on an actual mining disaster this early german talkie with english subtitles still remains one of the most effective docu dramas ever filmed featuring many non professional actors kameradschaft gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers regardless of which side of the french german border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone nullifying any superiors' orders a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades even at threat of great loss including life br br this film reminds of the self sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the 9 11 attacks putting aside any formal rules and regulations these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives and to find their fellow fire fighters more than 70 years later kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed
<START> i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 technically amateurish and 2 brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as clerks although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he's always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular crafts wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close
<START> the house that dripped blood is one of the better anthology films of the time period br br spoilers br br tracking down a missing film star inspector holloway john bennett finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside during the course of looking through the house he is told four different stories about past residents of the house br br the good story s method for murder moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while charles pens his latest masterwork horror novelist charles hillyer denholm elliott and his wife alice joanna dunham are thrilled with the story which centers around a serial strangler named dominic after a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife probably one of the better entries in the film it's easily the creepiest the atmosphere here is what sets it apart the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep out moment the classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office which is an all time high for creepiness the build up to it with the creaking sounds quick flashes of a mysterious being and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor br br sweets for the sweet moving into a new house widower john reid christopher lee hires former school teacher ann norton nyree dawn porter for his young daughter jane chloe franks while he's away on business ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane's past which john vehemently denies when she learns the true nature of what has happened it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible with the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories this is a quite pleasant entry the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out with small amounts of clues piled up here and there and the final revelation is downright nerve wracking that part alone is the main reason why this one works and lee doesn't harm it either br br the bad story s waxwork tortured by memories of his lost love phillip grayson peter cushing and his friend neville rogers joss ackland both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum as the statue takes over their lives they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them there's a clever premise here and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum which are always creepy this is no exception and it looks eerie which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace it takes a long time for events to unfold out and most of the time is spent on exposition it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away those really lower this one a bit had the twist been changed it would've scored higher the rest is acceptable br br the cloak veteran horror film actor paul henderson jon pertwee upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store the cloak soon turns him into a vampire going crazy on the set with co star carla ingrid pitt and other vampiric acts at home unconvinced the cloak is the cause he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination this has a pretty decent premise and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares but what sinks it is several factors first it's just too goofy for it's own good the plot twist at the end is a perfect example which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all and just comes across as just plain silly there's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through it's the weakest one in the film br br the final verdict a quite decent omnibus film there's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films br br today's rating pg 13 violence
<START> this is a truly classic movie in its story acting and film presentation wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie miss sullivan and jimmy stewart being the foremost characters in real life she greatly admired and liked jimmy and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set the chemistry between the two was always apparent and so warm and enjoyable to behold she was such a beautiful young woman and so sweet in her personality portrayals the story of these two young people and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch and pure magical entertainment heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story movie i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic that has a special appeal for all generations a must see for all
<START> summer holiday is the forgotten musical version of eugene o'neill's ah wilderness and deservedly so with the broadway musical adaptation of take me along with the exception of the stanley steamer song none of the other harry warren ralph blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable br br it was right after the release of this film that mgm let mickey rooney go and i don't think it was a coincidence the film was made in 1946 and released in 1948 so mickey was 26 playing an andy hardy like teenager he was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion br br rooney made four films for mgm from 1946 to 1948 this one killer mccoy a remake of robert taylor's a crowd roars love laughs at andy hardy and words and music in all of them rooney was playing an adult part even in the andy hardy film mickey played an adult andy hardy returned from world war ii why he was in this louis b mayer only knows br br rooney's bad casting makes summer holiday all the worse because in the original ah wilderness the emphasis is on the father's character played here by walter huston and in the broadway show take me along which won a tony award for jackie gleason the great one played the inebriated brother in law uncle sid here played by frank morgan and that's the central character br br gloria dehaven steps in for judy garland as rooney's sweet and adorable girl friend and marilyn maxwell plays the show girl who gives rooney an adult education in the original play o'neill has her as a prostitute but this was the hollywood of the code so all marilyn does is get young rooney soused br br a lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best but summer holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn
<START> i have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film's imdb space i saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema's new york asian film festival which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year see vital snake of june cha no aji survive style and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind and becomes a vivid memory br br i'm sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of subway cinema which is probably why i made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film the description built up the kind of horror film that i had longed for for a while one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares p was in fact different it relied on cheap laughs br br the incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as lesbians team up to fight monsters completely untrue there is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and pookie is actually going somewhere more lies this film seems like a short made for are you afraid of the dark the story is ridiculous and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the 9 that they wasted at the door i almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that i could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror cum porn that belongs on the spice channel which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival the only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it couldn't extract itself from the sh te that it is anyway i hope i can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences knocking out soulplane for the number 2
<START> as a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent this prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous unbelievable this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to restricted not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex violence heavy dance music its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth reason or political religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me these kids are definitely not from this planet the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting the scene with eric stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining but this old concept was far better portrayed much more believable in the brilliant classic original frankenstein with boris karloff caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film no surprise there overall this movie was bland unoriginal cheap looking using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg i doubt i'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the sci fi channel unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure zzzzzzzz
<START> this is without a doubt the funniest of the curly stooges shorts i've seen it dozens of times and it always makes me laugh hilarious pantomime sequences a perfect example of musical comedy even people who don't like the knuckleheads remember this one fondly
<START> malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different especially designed for people who like yellow filters on their movies
<START> phew i don't what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john waters' early offerings perhaps i should take that back i don't want to insult waters' ability as a director storyteller br br i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause it's full faith and credit by the way br br this also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multi involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt some might say to pull something off like that
<START> a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining sadly no memorable quotes here but this one's my favorite alexandre if you're leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what i'm telling you now farewell i'm going but to disappear to hide like a criminal is ignoble didn't watch it with english subtitles br br in my opinion this expresses it all there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of liberated love by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved it does indeed show this in a convincing manner but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth it's not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure but people especially men i think should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated love br br that said the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching
<START> the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should br br hedeen's outlook 0 10 no stars f
<START> i watched this movie at a sneak preview screening and i'm glad i didn't pay for it this movie is just disgusting its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences such as the shootout in little germany i made a little list of things i enjoyed in the movie and a lot of which i didn't agree of br br 1 dave foley's penis 2 the fart jokes 3 the poop jokes 4 the dude was a pussy 5 no gary coleman 6 the talibans 7 again making fun of bush we get it he's an idiot move on 8 the dude has blonde hair 9 the plot 10 the killing of minors 11 uwe boll was in it 12 most of the cast were just outrages and out there br br now the few good ones br br 1 the dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game 2 lots of action 3 crotchy made a return and a cameo of the maker of postal 4 uhm i didn't have to pay for it 5 there are a few what the ef moments br br boll did it again he made another crappy game into movie adaption kudos to you mr boll 2 10
