<START> kalifornia came out in 1993 just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 this is a nice psycho thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work like with most of his episodes of the x files playing god and red shoe diaries br br people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south for every brian and carrie in the south there is an adele and early and in 2006 that's the real horror of this flick br br aside from that i think the film was written with a cult film intention like with carrie's photography it's not suitable for mass consumption but if you have a copy of this in your personal library i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies
<START> i saw this film without to know what about were i'm a fan of branagh even more his shakespeare' films and in the beginning i saw it only for this and i finished with tears in my eyes because the great great serenity values affect and brave philosophy about life of helena's girl recommended to people who are bored with tv programming in spain at least
<START> i saw this movie yesterday on turner and i was unable to stop watching until it was over even though i sort of could guess what would happen farrell was great in her role and everyone else did a super job some of it seemed to stretch the limits but all in all i loved it if you get the chance to see it please do i actually cried at a few scenes but then i guess if you are a mom you would loretta is beautiful and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there it seemed ahead of its' time i say watch it if you can and don't listen to criticisms as they say i laughed i cried i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i f you thought sam mendes' first film the much heralded american beauty was a movie with style to spare wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort the unrelentingly grim 30's gangster melodrama road to perdition some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to the godfather a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr mendes' extraordinary technical prowess if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great then yes road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography editing music scoring and sound what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over as with american beauty there is a cold distancing feel to this movie despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love loyalty and betrayal br br this story of a hit man tom hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father figure who is also his boss an elderly irish mob leader paul newman seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past the father son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent this is obviously a gangster film hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom br br that being said i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film indeed it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary in fact the entire film is a technical marvel mr mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color and he and mr hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme br br if i have failed to duly note the acting it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably everyone in the film is top notch with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys daniel craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled impulsive son of newman's gangster father and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here if a rolls royce was a movie i've no doubt it would look like road to perdition
<START> stan ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer br br the boys are wonderful in this feature which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces the horn factory always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation laurel hardy inhabit a world where icy radios bedded billy goats are the rule not the exception with its brief length the film is more in style with their classic short subjects which explains its episodic nature br br only the boys get screen credit but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces james finlayson appears as a loony doctor richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role sweet mary gordon plays the boys' perplexed neighbor that's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber br br one of the film's script writers was silent comedian harry langdon br br stan ollie are the main focus however watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn or laurel's antics with bananas for instance reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants
<START> this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america racism br br plot story higher learning is mostly centered around malik played by omar epps a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends fudge ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named deja tyra banks later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus remy play by michael rapaport is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are br br opinion higher learning is not without its flaws character development is scarce okay performances by omar epps tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads whose name i forgot busta rhymes doesn't fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was clichÃ©' before this film so you know i didn't like that part of the film with kristy swanson other than that this movie wasn't half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps even though i could do without the accent fudge was ice cube's best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy all in all it was one of john singleton's best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft
<START> this review comes nearly 30 years late nevertheless it has to be mentioned that i chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight i just had to write about it i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie how ironic it is to see literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man yet what a welcome irony it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role he delivered an astounding and triumphant performance i have never seen anything like it all the other actors are very good too the whole movie was put together beautifully i don't care what anyone says about this movie i just love it and love it it made me happy and satisfied it crushes me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a e's p j which i believe is the ultimate mini series br br the excerpts from jane eyre spooked me a little back in school i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy the scenes and mr dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously which of course is a masterpiece bravo to the whole team and especially to mr dalton this movie is now a part of me br br i give it 10 10 rating
<START> when discussing a movie titled 'snakes on a plane' we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot br br what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they slither these snakes do nothing of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary br br why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole 'less is more' ethic or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them sparingly br br take one look at john carpenters 'the thing' here we have real slime and gore of eerie proportions 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap 'snakes on a plane' when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwards br br sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure i'm with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way br br i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no i'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie br br the current generation seem to have very low expectations and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including doa dead or alive another cgi animal film called 'flushed away' and another crap looking comedy named 'click' in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap british horror comedy i've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time br br expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for Â£1 in 6 months time and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips forget it
<START> i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks i'd have to say i got my money's worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as meatloaf said two outta three ain't bad br br the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies i've seen or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it's of at least high school play level br br the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stop motion animation would have looked better br br so you may be asking why i call the cg the second worst part that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant i've been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie usually when the background sounds drown out the movie's dialogue it's a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i wasn't missing much br br the action was infrequent and boring the tension was non existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookie cutter and bland the only mildly engaging byplay was between actually i can't think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it br br the cinematography was decent a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer br br if you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs
<START> that song keeps humming in my head not the greatest song but it's the 80's this movie is about a lead singer who supposebly gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band the lead singer whos name is billy eye yeah right is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think theres something wrong with her and that shes imagining things she finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if he's still there she sees that he's dead but still see's and hears his voice during the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this billy has a brother named john right again and john admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy the ending is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden but i like it anyway i watch it for the song i wish i had it
<START> i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest role br br lynn as i'm sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driver br br unfortunately other than lynn's amazing performance i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it br br oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son of a gun you son of a witch shoot and well forget you br br o k bye br br p s does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
<START> this movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid being that this comment requires 10 lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie unintelligble garbage schitzoid waste of talent movie is ice with paper on destination with ringing clouds on a sunny dive in the pudding sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair now explain that to me
<START> i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid and i thought it was so cool now i am 26 years old and my friend has it on dvd br br we got a case of brew and watched this classic it lost none of it's original kung fu coolness if you are a fan of kung fu karate movies this is a must see the dvd is available i believe this movie is also called pick your poison br br watch it soon
<START> a most awaited film of the year 2002 after three and half years of hibernation rajini has acted in this movie the hype for this film was toooooo high br br this is not a typical rajini film in this film he gives some spiritual messages also but it also includes typical rajini actions style songs etc its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also br br i will rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the screenplay its a must watch movie dont miss it
<START> some have compared this film to deliverance i believe of mice and men is more appropriate our leading man heaton definitely loves spike it is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love it is the reason heaton does not leave spike he needs him they need each other as brothers as family as their only connection to humanity the setting scenario minimal cast all add up to a fine film frankly i did not care what happened to the characters but i did care about what the film maker did with them he did well with them i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing
<START> are we really making 'video nasties' again in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm this is quite a ride unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris hamburg and amsterdam i am however being rather churlish for the 'depraved' scenes including everything from hot wax harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning beheading and some these scenes are immaculate and it's a pity bruno and his budget couldn't stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures
<START> since i watched it for the first time piedras is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women all of them somehow interconnected with deep understanding and sensibility ramÃ³n salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut and proves himself as an efficient actors' director br br not that all performances are excellent though of all leading ladies they range from average najwa nimri to very good vicky peÃ±a but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer mÃ³nica cervera who convincingly plays antonia san juan's retarded daughter enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's male nurse and there are nice small turns from andrÃ©s gertrÃºdix geli albaladejo and the director himself ramÃ³n salazar br br piedras is beautifully written and filmed when i watched it i got so moved that i couldn't stop thinking of it for days i highly recommend it
<START> the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine it's one interesting twist on the themes from it's a wonderful life br br zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working kaminsky is mostly bedridden he's reduced to applying for welfare in desperation like jimmy stewart he cries out to god for some help br br now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently but even stewart had trouble accepting travers but travers had one thing going for him he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone god sent mostel something quite different the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment br br belafonte hasn't accepted he's moved on from life he's still got a lot of issues he also has a wife gloria foster who doesn't know he's passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film you put his issues and mostel's issues and you've got a good conflict starting with the fact that mostel can't believe in a black jew named levine br br this was the farewell performance for polish jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o'shea playing a nice jewish doctor remembering o'shea's brogue from the verdict i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor br br the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society it's brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud make sure to catch it when broadcast
<START> there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the on screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by shriek show who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release it's a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some cropping aspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la casa 4 witchcraft the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films retitled and the third la casa was another film by the same production company filmirage which is best known here in america as ghosthouse to make matters even more confusing witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse 2 except in germany where ghosthouse 2 is actually the ogre demons 3 ok i better just shut up now i'm starting to confuse myself br br regardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort some of it is good some of it isn't i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a german speaking witch hildegard knef photographer gary david hasselhoff who wants to capture witch light and his virginal writer girlfriend leslie cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who's showing off the property to potential buyers rose annie ross and freddie robert champagne brooks also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael manchester as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan catherine hickland hasselhoff's wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in black br br so what can you expect to find here plenty of unpleasantries one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow roasted by the rest of the cast there's also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a sesame street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff from a technical standpoint it's a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotel island setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like they're having fun and knef is great as the evil witch even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days he's not bad in his role either br br on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid are so bad they're constantly distracting
