<START> amazing documentary saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years i was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a best documentary oscar for 2002 the year it was released no other documentary even comes close br br it was on tv recently for the 5th anniversary but i missed the added where are they now segment at the end except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit br br i've seen criticism on documentary film making from a few on this list i can't see how this could have been done any different they had less than 6 months to assemble this and get it on the air the dvd contains more material and background br br i'm also surprised that according to imdb com the brother have had no projects in the four years since what have they been doing
<START> i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it was br br now i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end br br ok the plot was solid single president falls for a lobbyist ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney annette bening br br there were several ridiculous premises in this movie 1 the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly a closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst br br 2 secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible br br 3 the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu was a joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative br br i thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failed br br its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
<START> well wayne's world is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off shoot movies from such cinematic offal as it's pat to the recent 80 minute yawn a night at the roxbury many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades the well written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor consisting largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory its a just great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously tiffany amber thiessen of saved by the bell fame makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible finally billy dee williams reliving his colt 45 days gives the movie a touch of class and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself you will find this movie to be eminently quotable ooh it's a lady
<START> did i miss something here this adaptation has everything that brookmyres first novel had everything apart from the story the laughs the black humour the political intrigue the characterisations the plot and some semblance of sense br br spoilers br br godamnawful from beginning to end they made a mockery of the plot they had a romance between parablane and a cop and what was that all about dr slaughter was portrayed as a bystander and who the hell was annette crosby supposed to be br br it looked like they had made a three hour adaptation then chopped it down to 90 minutes even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever please please do not do this to any other of brookmyres books especially country of the blind
<START> i went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when i got in the room there was only me and my girlfriend this shouted to me that this film is not very good br br not to my surprise the film was dire ben affleck plays a guy who buys a family for christmas it is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him his acting is okish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good the plot line is poor and the comedy almost non existent br br however there are some good points for example the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny br br i hope this review stops other people wasting their money i was very embarrassed when i came out of the room
<START> no other movie has made me feel like this before and i don't feel bad like i don't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie 9 months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this the reason i say is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted cauliflower milk and baguettes this much thank you ed br br uh clears throat no words no thoughts i don't know i truly don't know cait
<START> this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance the show of shows is pretty gigantic vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces 'an oriental number' and on and on it lumbers grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound it is far too long but among it's delirious delights are the awesome singin in the bathtub number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty nick lucas and the never ending grand finale in two color color which is all set to the song lady luck so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en ter tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort row after row of doll characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor i kid you not there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes unable to move for days i imagine during production whilst this katzenjammer of toy box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions and so should you and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill it is all so demented
<START> this movie is one i strongly recommend it's about a boy stanley yelnats shia lebeouf who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake a boys' detention center there he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter while there he meets the other boys of the camp zero magnet armpit squid x ray and zigzag all of them are digging not to 'build charactor' but to find outlaw kate barlow's treasure throughout the movie and book stanley learns more about the past more about himself and more about digging holes i give this movie a 9 5 because i am very picky when it comes to books to movies i want the movie to follow the book exactly but still it did real well
<START> because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot i'd like to mention a few points about this film there may be spoilers here i don't care enough to filter them out br br given the film's low budget the creature design was quite good it's actually nice to see a direct to video horror film that's not slathered with awful cgi unfortunately the digital film quality's quite grainy in places and it's most noticeable in the well lit white halls of the asylum br br ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established as is it merely seems amateurish br br plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil trumps good development would surface at the end br br this may seem like quibbling but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense first of all regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest induced why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion what's the background what's supposed to make us care about anyone in this and just as importantly who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency this film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt br br bottom line see the wicker man instead
<START> bend it like beckham reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny bopper movies directed by john hughes everything takes place in a bubble gum colored world where everyone is attractive there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes nothing wrong with this however bend it like beckham is an absolute treat from beginning to end my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it and at the end as embarrassing as this is to admit we applauded and we saw this by the way in our living room not in a theatre watch this movie and enjoy br br grade b
<START> i'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic the little girl was a brat their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile not a gator obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc it is a sad excuse for a movie especially the ending i nearly fell asleep with this one
<START> this clever film was originally a japanese film and while i assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when american international films hacked the film to pieces and inserted american made segments to fool the audience now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was done and done with little finesse or care about the final product the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different plus the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about gamera the evil flying turtle and although this is a fire breathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film in particular film veterans brian donlevy and albert dekker they both just looked tired and ill at ease for being there br br now as for the monster it's not quite the standard godzilla like creature seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious on the other hand the crappy model planes destructible balsa buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise plus an odd japanese monster movie clichÃ© is included that will frankly annoy most non japanese audience members and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him yeah right well just like in godzilla versus the smog monster and several other films you've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later incarnations of godzilla gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year old bad acting meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa don't believe them this is a terrible film br br fyi apparently due to his terrific stage presence gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations none of these change the central fact that he is a fire breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame
<START> first of all i need to say that i'm portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even none br br and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when leÃ£o da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsaÃ§Ã£o zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common br br this one is also good not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy in fact it's officially a drama a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid br br the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix br br if you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured
<START> back to the roots with like it is in heaven what are the real values of life these swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart we've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat love pure and joy within the music of a choir that's simple yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone br br from the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple warm and rough people of the north br br he wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionally br br don't go see it if you've been normed to hollywood this stuff contains no extras just your laughter your compassion your tears
<START> a good cast with one major exception pushes its way through epstein's smart light satire mansfield was never better or funnier than she is here paired with walston who's a veteran who's determined to become a congressman to get out of the war he and his buddies including suave con artist grant head to san francisco on leave and start the city's swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours the only thing about this movie that's not delightful is suzy parker's one note performance as grant's love interest which takes up too much of the film's time and slows down the pace in the second half walston and mansfield have good chemistry the gimmick is that she's set on making love to every serviceman to do her duty for the war effort of course but he's a married man who nonetheless loves his wife they steal the movie with little trouble from grant who's amusing here in the first part of the film when not paired with his non actor co star
<START> the inspiring story of carl brashear cuba gooding jr a black man who grew up in poverty in kentucky and then joined the us navy aspiring to be the first black master diver in navy history we are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true and then to keep it alive not the least of the challenges was master diver bill sunday robert deniro the head trainer at the diving school the navy sends brashear to who is not especially sympathetic to brashear's goals but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter br br this is a good movie fast paced and with a lot of action although not an action pic in the normal sense of the word there's a very human story here as well and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it there's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960's between older and younger naval officers the old navy vs the new navy the performances are quite good particularly goodings' i thought deniro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of sunday although who knows sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon and the portrayal of sunday's wife gwen by charlize theron also made me question whether these parts were jazzed up to provide entertainment value br br a good movie though i never once wondered if it was worth tuning into br br 7 10
<START> was it foreshadowing when tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot and then her new boyfriend the murderer turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence i think so scenes to make you squeal with delight montages galore a strip tease in a kimono what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on instead of take them off and a climactic battle on skis definitely tune in for the beginning and end but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening is it better than co ed call girl nah does tori ever make it to paradise or out of the snow even nope
<START> finally after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of basic instinct we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this i remember everything about the original the steam the romance the sex the interrogation the music by the master jerry goldsmith and everything else from violence and murder to intense confrontations of all kind make no mistake basic instinct was a real winner for audiences everywhere i can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel five years later we have it i never would have thought it to end up such as this when it was declared a dropped project time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with well i guess we now know anything's possible in this case even if the original director or writer are not present all we need is the glamorous always reliable sharon stone and we have a done deal please hear me out br br when people say that this film is bad i think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme and slightly dated i use the word dated only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years and audiences have become adapted to the pointless boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly who needs hole some and clean of course it's a pleasant thing to have but c'mon escapism is really seldom these days and basic instinct 2 gives us real fans what we've been expecting this film is not an academy award winner nor does it try to be it simply delivers the die hard fans what they have been expecting it's a film for fun movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously but this film is just loose and fun not taking itself seriously not too seriously anyway that said i shall evaluate the film br br the film is a fast paced film from the first second as we see cathernine tremell in a car speeding at 110 mph and enjoying lustful thrills doing so perhaps sex and driving does not mix because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and well she gets away unharmed but her studly partner doesn't fare too well once again tremell is the primary suspect of the accident and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists dr michael glass morrissey is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her like another criminal investigator before him he is entranced and seduced slowly and surely his denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do tramell is possibly more dangerous now than she was before but like the first one we'll never really know will we once the seduction is in motion jealousy rage drugs and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues br br this film does not recycle the first one but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time this is a good thing it lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two sharon stone dazzles us again as though 14 years has not come to pass her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier just awesome david morrissey is well cast and manages pretty well the fact that a non popular star was chosen makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him just what we see him perform my final thought 8 5 to 9 out of 10 so it's not the first one nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place it can however live up to the standards set by the first film and it does folks it does
<START> maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than i've been for a while br br it is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled that's much of what makes it so good it's an elaborate special effects laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small things br br i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
<START> truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen ever br br they tried to make up for it by giving it the 'we know we are doing this' routine that would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'the simpsons' had already done it and it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place br br the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's mainly j d's fantasies the flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred just compilations of say j d falling over or i don't know elliott falling over if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life br br scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit coms have to and it disappoints me they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this br br i was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit com br br and just as a passing thought why the hell was dr cox bald
