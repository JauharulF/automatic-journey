<START> live feed is set in some unnamed chinese japanese asian district somewhere as five american friends sarah ashley schappert emily taayla markell linda caroline chojnacki mike lee tichon darren rob scattergood are enjoying a night on the town taking in the sights after a scuffle in a bar with a japanese triad boss stephen chang they decide to check out a porno theatre as you would inside they are separated quickly find out that the place belongs to the triad boss who uses it to torture kill people for reasons which aren't made clear can local boy miles kevan ohtsji save them br br this canadian production was co written produced directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety success of hostel 2005 the mini craze for 'torture porn' as it's become known according the imdb's 'trivia' section for live feed writer director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres for my money i reckon he wrote it after watching hostel the script is pretty poor there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing killing people none was it for the triads was it for his pleasure was it to make snuff films to sell some sort of explanation would have been nice also why did he turn on the triad boss at the end if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex s m horror torture gore action films which doesn't come off i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good there still needs to be a decent script story right the character's were fairly poor clichÃ©s some of their actions motivations were more than a little bit questionable it moves along at a reasonable pace it's fairly sleazy mixing gore sex nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect br br director nicholson doesn't do anything special here the editing is choppy annoying he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea the film has a cheap look about it available in both 'r' 'unrated' versions i saw the shorter cut 'r' version which really isn't that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the 'unrated' version say that it might be much much gorier but i can't say for sure there's a fair amount of nudity too if that's your thing i wouldn't say there's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i suppose br br technically live feed isn't terribly impressive the blood looks a little too watery for my liking entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening it to often looks like it was shot on a hand held camcorder the choppy editing at least on the 'r' rated version is at times an annoying mess shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in vancouver in canada the acting is poor sometimes i couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing br br live feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out buy or rent i didn't think much of it with it's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition which goes nowhere poor acting less than impressive gore at least in the 'r' rated cut anyway watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior
<START> you remember the spice girls movie and how bad it was besides the songs well their manager simon fuller also this band's manager makes the same error putting s club another of my favourite bands in their own film s club tina barrett jon lee bradley mcintosh jo o'meara hannah spearritt and rachel stevens what happened to the seventh member paul cattermole basically ask their boss for a break they go on and while there they see themselves on tv three of them swap and vice versa half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist and the other half just get themselves in trouble also starring gareth gates as a clone of himself this film may have more of a plot than spice girls' film did but besides the songs bring it all back don't stop movin' and never had a dream come true this is no goo reason to see this film not too long after the band split for good adequate

<START> my college professor says that othello may be shakespeare's finest drama i don't know if i agree with him yet i bought this video version of the film first i love kenneth branagh as iago he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation surprisingly he didn't direct it but played a role lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do not that there was a british vs american issue about it in fact if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do apart from other shakespeare tragedies this is dealt with the issue of race something that has existed since the beginning of time the relationship between iago and emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together while othello loves desdemona with all his heart he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non moorish man like cassio it's quite a great scene at the end of the film but i won't reveal the ending it's just worth watching i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare
<START> my girlfriend picked this one as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante bellum south totally absurd i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell who being southern knows better to participate in this crap
<START> as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do it 'till i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example the santa claus gag others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example the students' awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry don't get me wrong about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than out of 4
<START> yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance br br the scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 8 10 go see it
<START> this movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero if you have a weak tummy at all don't watch animal rights people you don't want to watch either it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story its really really super creepy that this guy worked at adt while he killed people still feel safe when you punch in that little code i don't he had access to every code in kansas i hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring do your self a favor and don t rent buy this movie i think it cost about 20 to make that includes their over paid actors
<START> the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore the makers of you've got mail claim their film to be a remake but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise anyway if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's you'll find the shop around the corner to be nothing short of wonderful just as good with repeat viewings enjoy
<START> having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions yet it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both men's love of oratory i think self absorbed dennis quaid an actual texan would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self worship as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here our unofficial motto is it ain't braggin' if it is a fact was made for crockett and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat finally that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1 500 well trained mexican regulars every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand
<START> i'm a big fan of the old westerns and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy fallen but virtuous woman bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation etc i can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young actor who plays granger's son any nepotism there i've seen better acting in high school plays chill wills plays a cartoon characterization of chill wills have i reached the 1000 words yet
<START> it's funny it's not arthur miller or t s elliot but man this is funny kline and fields are great her toss off line god you are so disgusting as she climbs in his window great kline's running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher great too robert downey jr and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is a soap opera turn if there every was one br br the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price br br doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t v i hope just a lot of fun
<START> spoilers spoilers if one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick the plot is as follows a group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing i live in south africa so it was released as blood surf admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat however this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt water crocodile br br the script is absolutely terrible a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film no one seems to give a damn the most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself they introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film br br the acting can be said to be mediocre it probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from all in all there isn't one person who made a terrible impact on me every single person seemed to be a watered down caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me br br the crocodile itself is said to be huge over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film the crocodile's death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one's stomach turn with a huge cry of bravado the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily placed spike at the bottom of this said hill br br all in all i would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be what probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie
<START> a grade z horror filmmaker carl monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low budget gory mayhem his movies are full of inept gore laughable acting boring sub plots and woeful dialogue a mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion unfortunately this film is almost bloodless you don't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters the pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting the acting is merely competent but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed a generous 4 out of 10 just beware do not mistake monson's film with andy milligan's equally weak legacy of blood
<START> i don't know what i missed here but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film i thought it was silly and a bit over the top i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker however the others were just boring br br now i like b movies i really do but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the dead as well as on par with the re animator you must be joking i didn't find this film funny it tried it did make an effort possibly too much of an effort but it failed in my opinion by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th one liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch br br there were definitely homages made to several other films which is always cool kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans but here it may have just been a lack of original thought admittedly there were some nice special effects good gore but that can't carry an entire movie the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut and in the early stages of mutation chet from weird science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creature children from the explorers it just didn't work i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed then there was brenda the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped the design once again was totally unimaginative a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle yawn br br now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a romero had a patent on them and was the only writer director allowed to make movies about them he's the only person so far to do it right with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy oh and danny boyle but they were a different style of zombie maybe mr romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re animated the people of wheelsy just didn't have the proper motivation they were horrible zombies br br so in the end i give slither a 3 for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes
<START> ok look at the title of this film br br the title says it all right the title is great i mean a lot of things should come into your head after readin it in fact you might be extremely anxious to see it br br well sadly you won't see any of that br br just a bunch of bad actors some blood spilling some hot chicks and some lesbo action br br oh well i think there are about 5 10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed br br get away from this if you want to see a good movie else get it
<START> yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of work br br i thought the movie was ok nothing really outstanding i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life br br ahh but that can't happen to rich kids now can it not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion br br no the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed after all who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school br br ah the poor little rich kids in their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite parties what will the world do without them br br i hope they all get addicted to drugs pass away their life and end up in jail so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world
<START> walt disney's cinderella takes a story everybody's familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense while retaining the tale's essential charm disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere it is beautifully if conventionally animated the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown mack david al hoffman and jerry livingston provide lovely songs like a dream is a wish your heart makes and bibbidi bobbidi boo that enhance both the scenario and the characters br br even though cinderella's story is predictable it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers' interest the film's suspense however is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness especially in the musical numbers it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends moving the viewers to care for them overall walt disney's cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century
<START> vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper the tales he weaves are gossemar silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions his words have been treated well once before in the remarkable slaughterhouse 5 br br mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island along with slaughterhouse 5 and bluebeard br br the film version deserves a 10 but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just can't do it some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory
