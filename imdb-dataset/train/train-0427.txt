<START> what a pleasant surprise a disney dtv direct to video sequel that's actually good the lion king 1 1 2 is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog timon and pumbaa it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until timon complains that we're not here yet after fighting over the remote timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the laughs begin br br to be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their direct to video fare has been aggressively awful with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original 1 1 2 decides to try something different it tells the original story from a new point of view okay it adds some stuff like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met but it's an interesting concept nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie there's also some neat movie parodies including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good the bad and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke and the script is filled with funny memorable lines br br added to the cast are julie kavner the simpsons as timon's worry wart mom and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max matthew broderick shows up as simba and his teen scene reminded me of ferris bueller everyone does well especially robert guillame is that how you spell it as rafiki who exudes more and more yoda speak in this movie timon comments on this several times br br 'the lion king 1 1 2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation 10 10
<START> vincent cassel plays the part of paul an ex con assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is Âquite deaf' when she has her hearing aids in Âvery deafÂ when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as people br br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters Â not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he's just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines br br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified br br finally it is a film full of great Âmoments' both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it Â but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
<START> i had high hopes for troy and i am so bitterly disappointed the film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache the pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film well apart from a nice fight scene between achilles pitt and hector bana the rest was shallow br br and why oh why does hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval' agamemnon didn't die in troy the war lasted 10 years and achilles was killed by paris outside the walls of troy with an arrow to the ankle it annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap br br and don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between helen and paris she was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other no sparks no emotion no hope br br i have to say in the films defence brad pitt eric bana and peter o' toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie br br can anybody tell me where the Â£200 million budget went maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres where did they get all those trees br br i am so disappointed it hurts
<START> beaudray demerille a weak peter fonda who also directed an aging gambler wins young teen wanda nevada pretty but not talented brooke shields in a poker game together the unlikely pair of course embark on a search for indian gold in the grand canyon br br that's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it it just isn't there the acting is very weak too which was quite a surprise given the fact that peter fonda was in the lead br br if you're looking for something interesting in this film take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young brooke shields her character however is so irritating especially at the beginning and dumb that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing too bad but given the story i doubt anything more could be made of this i wonder why peter fonda directed and starred in this film he must have even talked his father henry fonda into a useless cameo in this ridiculous mess unfortunately this was their only film together couldn't henry be in easy rider for example 3 10
<START> i cannot get past the message of this movie it's laid out much too clearly to ignore and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it's about i haven't read the novel but pollack's film opens with a scene at a cia front organization in new york which is broken into by two professional assassins headed by max von sydow who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we've come to know and understand the staff include an elderly female receptionist a fussy elderly professorial guy who's toupee falls off when he is machine gunned is that a joke and last the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier realizes she is about to be murdered and says pitifully brave i won't scream von sydow replies sympathetically i know these murders are completely unexpected savage unmotivated by anything that we are aware of and graphic it is a brutal scene br br there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end br br after having killed these innocent good guys von sydow switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable sensitive human being it is better to live in europe things are not so rushed or whatever i swear i'm not making this up pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat that's the message you should write it down in case you forget just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values not to mention common sense upside down like that i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states even hate it and who see conspiracies just about everywhere providing a knee jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends nevertheless at some point this dislike this hatred if it increases in intensity must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric i don't for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official i don't care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation br br i'd like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message but i can't it's quite well done in some ways that's worse because it makes the film less dismissable even new york city looks photogenic on the screen and it's been a long time since i've thought of new york as photogenic robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his character's initial shock and confusion but then turns into a telecommunicational semi genius and man he looks just fine his wardrobe is just right even his rimless glasses are becoming and his peacoat it's not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous he seems extremely handsome too the swine i want to look like that i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache faye dunaway is alright in her role but it's not too believable a role would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint even if he did look like redford would anyone be emotionally wounded if when this ambivalent relationship is about to end redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened cliff robertson is surprisingly good he does one or two extremely good double takes the mailman is superb the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and for once we really don't know for sure how it will turn out because redford a book reader after all seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin this is one of john housemann's final roles a shame he's a magnet on screen and what an end to his life a friend finds him lost wandering the streets of new york in a neighborhood he'd been familiar with for most of his life br br yes the movie is very well executed but i can't ignore that vicious paranoid message i have the same problem with leni riefenstahl's triumph of the will or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously this negro is dangerous
<START> farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post angel's career confounding us with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades but when it comes down to it there's no denying that this girl can act far from a story of epic proportions this well done tv movie is gentle quiet and occasionally moving fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister brad johnson plays the love interest and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama but then there's always that confounding farrah to watch and she does indeed remain eminently watchable and yes i admit it i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when silk hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the corkymeter bosley would be proud
<START> a very early oliver stone associate produced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman co founder and president of the world's only real independent film studio troma creator of the toxic avenger and at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival lifetime achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years having raised the money for this film on his own lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd's version of his own script as one of the world's most original daring experimental and non compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has but as it is we have the gershuni directed film and weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own sugar cookies is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and well crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives the shoestring budget the small studio this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now michael herz formed troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone played by enigmatic mary woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story this leads to a succession of plot twists mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock's vertigo and at least as inventive the atmosphere is a lot grimmer though and some comparisons to nicholas roeg's and donald cammell's performance come to mind in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a splendidly interwoven sub plot with a nod to kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what's the fuss makes for a very exciting one and a half hour certainly one of the best films in troma's library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry later seen in george romero's the crazies thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself highly recommended
<START> dietrich bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life words can hardly express my disappointment this movie was disjointed it gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great writings except a brief passing reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany apparently to show his human side ok i'm ready for the dramatic part the part where he stands up for his faith instead of emphasizing that we get a very badly acted romance with a 17 year old schoolgirl whether or not that actually took place it should not have been a major portion of the movie now still waiting for the dramatic part or some narration explaining what his writings were all about or something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drum roll waiting waiting zip nada this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow with some background even some voice overs or flashbacks to him preaching from his works some narrative about who he was and where he had been but no this is what we got hardly fitting for a hero of the faith
<START> holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho it's a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell there's no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992's beyond the mind's eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
<START> an absolutely brilliant film jiri trnka the master of puppet animation confronts totalitarianism in this his final film it would be banned by the communist czechoslovakian government at the time despite taking the country's highest animation award br br in this dark and entertaining short film an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose all of a sudden he here's a knock at the door and in comes this giant omnipotent hand that tries to force the artist to make statues in it's likeness the artist resists as best he can but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts by the hand to force him to conform he becomes brainwashed an intellectual zombie at this point the hand attaches strings to the artist puts him in a cage and uses him to make hand statues all the while glorifying the artist's work and awarding him with medals and honours br br the artist's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination and enables him escape his prison whether it be literal or in his mind and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand he shuts himself in thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high hoping it is out of the reach of the hand and it ends up falling on his head killing him the artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand's strings once dead the hand paints the artist as a great person a national hero unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered br br trnka's condemnation of totalitarian society and their lack of right for free expression is dark damning and an amazingly animated it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire and would perhaps even listen to that was obviously not acceptable an amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world from the us to the middle east a must see and definite 10 out of 10 talk about going out with a bang
<START> this is a feel good film about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them it is a beautiful and inspirational film why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out especially the good ones dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career with excellent supporting cast including brian cox as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's achievements go by without his support it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film if i have one complaint with this film it is this don't ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again br br seriously this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like field of dreams and the natural it rates two thumbs up and a big well done
<START> penn takes the time to develop his characters and we almost care about them however there are some real problems with the story here we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior and the time line is screwed up supposedly set in 1963 the music is late 60s early 70s the references and dialogue is 70s 80s the potential for a powerful climax presents itself and penn allows it to slip away but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch but not great
<START> this show started out with great mystery episodes i think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes after that the show started playing short episodes with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy doo br br i think hanna barbera productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes some of the voice actors became unavailable after 15 or 16 episodes frank welker who played fred became unavailable i think the voice of velma changes after first 12 episodes because the first voice actress who played velma was unavailable br br and the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy doo because the ratings were high so they had to make more shorts i wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes still it is a good show
<START> ah bait how do i hate thee let me count the ways 1 you try to be funny but are corny and unenjoyable every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter instead i want to hurl 2 you try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like bill gates and is about as scary as well bill gates just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun doesn't work does it a lawyer maybe but not a gun doesn't fit as for jamie foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to hurl 3 you try to be action packed but instead are dull and dragging too many times and when the action heats up the tripod for the camera must have been lost for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project and i find myself nauseated and once again i want to hurl 4 you try to be a good movie but you failed you failed you failed i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water no sunscreen and only meryl streep for company this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff but somehow manages to escape just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again
<START> monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory are there any else in hollywood polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul mouthed boss barnes who himself can't keep his hands off of his secretary's rear to get to the bottom pun intended of the story while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which by the way also supplies the town with jobs for the locals but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy feely enviro marxism pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex girlfriend on the beach tells her that he is seeing the mayor's daughter juanita and it's over between them then she is promptly eaten that night a little side action without the evidence my hat is off to you sir john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn't bounce br br supposedly based on a true story so much so they say it twice in the opening credits this film is awful on all fronts filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters even putting his daughter andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed utterly unwatchable dreck shame on you john carradine
<START> iberia is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience and time to time it's look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big
<START> i caught this a few months ago on family channel and having some memories of the tv show from my youth decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter i should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it 'cause this is just bizarre not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip talking flutes british children far too old for this kind of crap in the words of krusty the klown uuuuuugggghhhhh what was i on if you're a huge fan of the whole sid and marty krofft oeuvre go for it otherwise unless you're willing to get looped before watching stay far far far away
<START> this isn't art it's inner urban politically correct propaganda jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable it doesn't see people as individuals but rather as members of categories br br this is the most patronisingly offensive australian movie i can recall ever and it's up against some pretty stiff competition a message movie every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there aborigines are victims white men are violent or alcoholics white women aren't that bad particularly if they are lesbians but they're most likely of a depressive nature br br four men who go away fishing find the body of a murdered woman aboriginal naturally and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout it's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion as if the men are animals the one man who briefly demurs is the goodie we know this because he's living with a bisexual woman he likes to hold his baby a lot and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location away from all these beastly bush dwellers br br this is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within it's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt the film is shot through with long distance views of the bush backed by foreboding mysterious music it's made very clear by the end that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape it concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black white reconciliation br br in jindabyne country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other australians br br this film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the government's film finance corporation it's a product of the artsy set that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects which are as detached from real life as possible as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see it doesn't matter if the film is a stinker they still get paid br br spare yourself from wasting time avoid it like the plague more jaded social commentary than actual entertainment this film deserves to pan
<START> this is an extremely powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby br br meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts br br without giving anything away all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally
<START> the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed and in all probability never will and as in any story about any war beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving it is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective which is what director ang lee provides in ride with the devil ' a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the war itself and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war the infamous raid on lawrence kansas by quantrill and his raiders which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the confederate point of view br br in 1863 the union influence predominates in the state of kansas and even across the border in neighboring missouri those with confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching northerners especially without the aid of what could be considered any regular' confederate troops and when things begin to really heat up around their own town jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and jake roedel tobey maguire form a band of their own and join in the fray doing damage to the union cause wherever it is practicable jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing but they are standing up for what they believe to be right br br there are others however even among their own men like the young pitt mackeson jonathan rhys meyers who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims and so for jack bull and jake as well as many just like them it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood and they will have to ride with the very devil himself against seemingly insurmountable odds br br as with all of his films director ang lee approaches his story through an incisive yet subtle examination of the traditions cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting and in so doing lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers perhaps a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters eat drink man woman' the effects of class distinction sense and sensibility' the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies crouching tiger hidden dragon' or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above the ice storm' lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level this film is no exception and as he does with all his films lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography in this film by frederick elmes who also did the ice storm' brilliantly which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry it's that special lee touch and it adds a wistful reflective sense to whatever story he is telling which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable br br as jake tobey maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops and his character along with it most importantly maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere even in such troubled times the betrayal which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance and it is no small accomplishment it is however the kind of studied understated performance that is often taken for granted which is unfortunate work like this is worthy of acclaim and should be recognized br br skeet ulrich is effective as well as jack bull and jewel in her motion picture debut turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley it is jeffrey wright however who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt as well as jonathan rhys meyers who brings a chilling christopher walken like menace to his role of pitt also in what amounts to a cameo role one scene mark ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time br br the supporting cast includes james caviezel black john simon baker george clyde tom guiry riley tom wilkinson orton brown john ales quantrill john judd otto roedel and kathleen warfel mrs chiles the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation but hopefully as time goes on it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like ang lee and films like ride with the devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing in light of more recent events it is something that is sorely needed worldwide film is a powerful medium it can be educational as well as entertaining and perhaps in the future more filmmakers like ang lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are 8 10 br br br br br br
