<START> the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary this is still a must see for ww ii buffs descendants of the participants of that conflict politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier did you hear that george bush and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories many of the interviews are with second line authorities that is support personnel to the main characters privates captains secretaries eyewitnesses and the like you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about br br i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary i strongly recommend this over the worn out gaptoothed overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay i paid 120 cdn for five 2 sided dvd discs this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode the menus are easy to follow there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years nay after 60 years since the war finished br br i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy now my wish has finally come true br br see this documentary tell your friends buy a copy for your library remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america russia britain canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory what an eye opener
<START> i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself into br br i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture br br i finally know what hell is like it's this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn't even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens br br instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie br br don't even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win
<START> i always felt that a good film should have a plot this particular film was missing one and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever i was anxious for it to finally end however i just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long it felt like four hours not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict it's not the worst movie i've seen but i used to say that it was until i saw the fast and the furious so don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action i actually hate most action films out today it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum not much really happens in this movie however the scenery and costumes were nice
<START> i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr aoki he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened br br a very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and daughter br br i haven't seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent
<START> this is a very odd film i wasn't really sure what is was about some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all i didn't care about any of the characters none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer br br what was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does emilio shoot the kid that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film
<START> must have to agree with the other reviewer this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s and oh did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene and the ending the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie completely awful and yes it did contain every clichÃ© in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable let's remember when shots when a main character dies luckily i saw this on free tv don't waste your time
<START> imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch as soon as i first heard that my attention was locked on the trailer and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show i think the acting and casting is just perfect each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens they never seem to let me down and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical such as an exploding scratch sniff book br br even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest being not just a mystery but a love story comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie err show br br what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc for years i never had a reason to turn to abc but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me but just like that after two seasons a few awards a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me i will always be a fan of this show though and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch
<START> i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first cabin by the lake only instead of just killing women he kills men also and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him those scenes for me were very intense and riveting i gave the movie a rating of 8 10 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you wouldn't see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes what went wrong
<START> the music of albeniz pervades this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation e g piano but never full orchestra but often it is re worked with various contemporary ensembles e g guitar and treatments e g jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are 12Â14 scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to goose flesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you don't like subtitles don't worry the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvd's won't play on american dvd players this is a scandal
<START> after a dirty shame i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie that movie was really so bad that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie i decided to give it a try anyway only a couple of days later it was shown on television i taped it out of curiosity and now that i've seen it i can tell you that this pecker sure is a lot better than a dirty shame br br in this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york he's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby when he keeps his very first 'exhibition' in the shop where he works his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness his photographs are sold for enormous prices but when he sees how his family friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him and they do but what they get to see there is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine br br it's not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than a dirty shame the first reason is that this movie has an actual story this movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like isn't just funny it's not that far from the truth either i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it but apparently we are all supposed to like it the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer i'm not saying that everything that you will see is great but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong christina ricci br br overall this isn't a great movie but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes which never really go too far this is an enjoyable movie it certainly isn't the best comedy ever but i liked it a lot more than a dirty shame i give this movie a 6 5 10
<START> my nose is bent slightly out of shape as i write this i had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so i assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelines br br i found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of jordi mollÃ  a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as blow and the alamo leonor watling is also quite good unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script there is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art br br an actual day trip to the beach at valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime
<START> this movie could only originate in the 1970's it's a bizarre action movie set in a small california workers town some sort of mill or plant is closing down so suddenly rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets the townsfolk's are fed up so ben arnold jan michael vincent goes to another town to recruit his brother aaron played by kris kristofferson aaron is a vietnam vet who looks and acts a littleÂoff balance he hangs out with a bunch of other surly vietnam vet's they come into town to clean it up they become deputized but underneath their good deeds they are actually running gambling houses asking for protection money etc it takes a while for people to catch on and in a biblical cain and abel showdown vincent has to take on his older brother there's an interesting blue collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie which makes it interesting note the cock fighting scene vincent is almost too angelic in this role Â he thinks so highly of his brother he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds he's accused of he finally comes to his senses Â his girlfriend victoria principal is brutally shot in the back he himself is beaten up in his home kris kristofferson is creepily effective as aaron he coolly denies any wrong doing and even gently coos and talks to vincent's young daughter she refers to him as 'uncle aaron' even while he's threatening her father's life all the while smiling vincent and kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other bernadette peters makes an interesting appearance as a 'saloon' girl who attracts aaron's attention this is a good 70's action movie if you can find it it is not available on dvd yetÂ
<START> if you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so then it's ok to watch this it's not all that bad really yeah it's got more lapses in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people like myself i have to admit who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion but it's funny at least just because it's not always intentionally funny there's no need to let that get you down br br however if you've read the book or any of the other books by brookmyre then you'd probably best avoid it i've read them all and when i first watched this film i despised it i've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site in fact the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful and admittedly rabid brookmyre fans br br best bit of advice watch this then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement
<START> i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people br br as a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had knowingly deceived church members into believing he had been called to be joseph's successor as the prophet although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints rather he led them confidently by inspiration the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith that god truly speaks to prophets today and that brigham young like joseph smith was an inspired prophet of god br br whether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed
<START> don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of the crater lake monster to be a total surprise br br a claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of crater lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks not to mention your fast forward button to call the crater lake monster amateurish is to overstate the obvious if you aren't a fan of low budget drive in films you probably wouldn't be looking here in the first place br br the problem with the movie is that when there's no monster action going on it really sucks and goes nowhere the script is very ed wood ish in that it's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences nothing is too outlandish for the crater lake monster it explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into crater lake 'superheating' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable wouldn't superheating the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate other than some token fog in one or two scenes we see no evidence of the water being hot other than a few lines in the script br br the script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino a couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced they decide to rent a boat and head out into crater lake hmmmm do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity in a sequence that's just plain bizarre a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze a car chase ensues and wouldn't ya know it they end up right by the lake snack time for cratey yeah it's not hard to figure out and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold br br the shamelessness of it all is endearing and i really want to like the crater lake monster i just can't do it there's not enough here to go on and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk right over it and it wouldn't matter br br the film has a slim list of the things going for it the most important being the dinosaur itself which appears in three forms a shadow puppet a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good there are also a pair of lovable hicks in it and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie a downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it why was i so affected by this conclusion was it the mournful song played over the closing credits or was i just weeping inwardly for the time that i waste watching films like this
<START> frank sinatra plays a no goodnik ex soldier and frustrated writer hard living and hard drinking who returns to his midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother arthur kennedy now the town big shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter frank gets involved with gambler dean martin uneducated flooze shirley maclaine and has some run ins with the law but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman over simplified drama verging on soap opera with a role for maclaine that is by turns overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental her drunken belting on after you've gone is however the film's highlight and is expertly handled director vincente minnelli oversees it in straight forward fashion but he's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense the picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen with a nice eye for detail and composition but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs from
<START> such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe it's just meena mumari's feet but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection
<START> terrible just terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the acting etc etc the only good shoots meaning funny because they're so bad are the special effects overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage
