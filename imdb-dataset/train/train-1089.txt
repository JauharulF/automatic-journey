<START> i found this film embarrassing to watch i felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if i couldn't pick up the subtleties i needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly br br having a father who is still an alcoholic i didn't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such alcoholics true alcoholics are very lonely people inside in my opinion of course they find it hard to communicate something that the main character had no problem with really except he did have a problem saying i love you at one point which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character he was constantly surrounded with people too br br i felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil i couldn't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father i felt nothing at all when it had finished just relief it was over br br kevin mckidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead the clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick mckidd was too old for the teen they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult mckidd br br on a good note i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film
<START> this movie was pretty bad sci fi is usually my favorite channel so i watch all the original movies that play on it i really don't know if this movie can be called original starting a zoo theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar what was it oh yeah jurassic park but this has sabertooth tigers instead br br the movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt one of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects i've seen the blood looked a lot like ketchup also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand again sound like jurassic park probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck funniest death i've seen on tv br br the acting is extremely cheesy the special effects are horrible the cg tigers could almost pass for clay models and even some of the sounds were off for instance when one of the college students is trying to escape he uses an ax to break down a door the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound this movie was pretty bad the cheesy deaths were quite funny though
<START> in the tower of babel installment of the mini series the narrator describes the builders of the tower as the descendants of moses br br that's like saying george washington lived many centuries before alexander the great br br or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel br br or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow br br need i say more br br the writers of the greatest heroes of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronologies of biblical people and events
<START> being a fan of billy bob thornton and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadn't heard of it br br i'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2 1 2 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production br br now patrick swayze can't act for sour apples but thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry br br being curious i checked this site's production info it made a whopping 600 per screen its opening weekend and just over 400 each after its month's theater run in latter 2002 overall gross was 261k which i'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location br br the story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on br br it's something like several snl bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worse br br whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable even if all worked for less than their usual fees so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bob's present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here compared with his usual work br br think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in sling blade bandits and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick
<START> becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid i want someone to clue me in absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd br br the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent however i was disappointed on both counts god bless becky harris
<START> the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average it's not bad but it's really not very good the editing is good the film is well paced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that point br br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the oft present i'm pretty and confused look is prominent so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price other than that just don't see it it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
<START> tobe hooper has made great movies so i was certain this couldn't be bad i didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film at times this made me laugh sometimes i almost fell asleep sometimes made me almost cry for hooper br br i rated this 3 10 because its 1990 horror movie and many interesting or funny things happened there throughout the movie i was thinking something like they simply can't add more things in this movie but they did br br some tell this is some sort of firestarter clone but truly isn't it's based on that idea but thats all this is combination of horror comedy weird religion god things funny gore simple effects drama horrible acting unbelievable script and more br br spoilers story is government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails during process child is born for 2 test persons when mom sings to her child after the birth both husband and wife burns and it is spontaneous combustion government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and well when the government realizes okay now he can set this fire thing to work they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man because they could kill him no they can't shoot him no and argh i guess thats enough to tell i promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie br br well if you want good laughs watch this one gosh
<START> i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director's other films in the past i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled br br i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes they were hard to follow at times br br ultimately a moral tale it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film it is a film i would like to see again br br some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a psychic level were well done br br i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here intense
<START> i don't know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic br br i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti gay or they don't get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway it's not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do it's full of clichÃ©s and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing much less funny br br i hated it and i'm not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren't as unbiased in their judgment
<START> i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a pix entertainment and without exception everything this company deals with is pure crap first and this is very important never ever watch this movie sober why would you unlike many other entertaingly bad movies this one i feel was made intentionally bad i just can't get over how fake the snowman is which is why its always shown only briefly the way it moves is the best this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap becuz that was made too be a good movie and that version is as bad as this
<START> thunderbirds 2004 br br director jonathan frakes br br starring bill paxton ben kingsley brady corbet br br 5Â4Â3Â2Â1 thunderbirds are go br br and so began thunderbirds a childhood favorite of mine when i heard that they were going to make a thunderbirds movie i was ecstatic i couldn't wait to see thunderbird 2 roar in to save people while thunderbird 4 would dive deep into theÂyou get the idea i just couldn't wait then came august 2004 when the movie was finally released critics panned it but i still wanted to go after all as long as the heart was in the same place that was all that mattered to me so i sat down in the theater the only teenager in a crowd of 50Âeveryone else was over thirty and under ten quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that i have ever hadÂ br br the movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on alan tracy brady corbet the youngest of the tracy family he spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family but he's too young one day he finally gets his chance when the hood ben kingsley traps the rest of his family up on thunderbird 5 the space station this involves him having to outsmart the hood's henchmen and rescue his family in time before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of england br br trust me the plot sounds like a regular episode of thunderbirds when you read it on paper once it gets put on to filmÂwhat a mess we have on our hands first off the film was intended for children much like the original show was however gerry anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children's programming this on the other hand dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kids franchise the final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and i'm sure that jonathan frakes is wishing he'd never directed this br br over all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood playing the part extremely well my only complaint about the characters is about the hood's henchmen who are reduced to leftovers from old looney tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with ease br br what's odd about this movie is that while i was watching the movie i had fun but once the lights went up i realized that the movie was fairly bad i was 8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone a guilty pleasure perhaps nonetheless thunderbirds is a forgettable mess instead of a big go i'm going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbirds name however we get a movie that only die hard thunderbirds fans if you'd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother with br br my rating for thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars
<START> this programme bugs me there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called fun it's just far too educational for my liking the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again where's the fun in it also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much does it really need to have a slot on t v every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes i think it's time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like inspector gadget bananaman the smurfs snorks moomins the raccoons and count duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse so what's going on with that 3 10
<START> when i caught a glimpse of the title i thought are we going to get another try hard hip slasher but actually i found 7eventy 5ive to be a mildly passable and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid section it picks up momentum for the final half hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending it won't win awards for originality because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills usual cheap jump scares location secluded mansion and motivation from other films the gleaming direction is by the book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script sometimes laughable but nonetheless i was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe the performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing an always presentable rutger hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective a slickly made but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold
<START> the dukes of hazzard will academy awards best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie br br this movie was a torture to watch so sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs the only good thing about this crap was the car i remember when daisy was a real threat to look 4ward 2 who's the moron that decided that jessica simpson is hot we know she can't act but come on in the tv show daisy was a fox and brunette br br all members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former tv show br br i gave a empty dvd so this movie could be burned 4 me i sat trough it and i want my money back
<START> first off this movie was a wild ride the whole way the story of the training of the soldiers fighting with their superiors and in the end grouping together br br from the very beginning to the very end this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing at times beyond reason and the horrors of what boot camp are br br the dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times and sometimes humorous how bozz colin farrel deals with paxton matthew davis throughout the storyline from camp to tigerland and even in the end helping him br br the innovative free hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film constant moving constant action and just constant confusion at times it was a help others not so much br br throughout the film it was increasingly realistic some points in the film the sex scenes in particular seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them it was a very gritty movie through and through br br in my opinion this is one of colin farrel's better movies if not his top performance the acting for every character was superb 9 10 sysnuk3r
<START> when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins' worst however while when in rome isn't a terrible movie it's not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults won't find much to go on br br when in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was 10 or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute back on target both girls don't do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack ain't half bad either br br however where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichÃ©d and has hints of deja vu the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins' work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you don't learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work that looked rushed constantly br br all in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff 4 10 bethany cox
<START> i had nowhere to go i was on a flight to vancouver i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front i found this captivating and mesmerising i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door is yet to be discovered br br the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out' the story the photographs tell br br recommended if you have time on your hands
<START> when converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this woman's experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope don't waste your time with this movie read the book instead
<START> sidney franklin's the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from luis ranier who won an oscar for her portrayal of o lan rainers performance is so complete she is nearly unrecognizable having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one rainer relies instead on facial and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such br br the film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it when lung and wife o lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch that they again find fulfillment a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family especially for 1937 makes the film a classic money isn't worth anything without friends and family a point that the film drives home perfectly in it's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion
<START> granted i'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is but a well put together clever flick is worth the time my quibbles in brief br br dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character br br unconvincing acting br br storyline never really caught fire br br the writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films tossed into a kettle simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess al'dente br br long and short while not absolutely terrible it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix rentals
