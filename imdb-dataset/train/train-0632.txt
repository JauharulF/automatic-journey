<START> i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday first of all i wanted to see gina lollobrigida and here i wasn't disappointed she looked gorgeous second of all through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca's films on this account however i was sadly disappointed i found the jokes predictable apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely one dimensional also the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all i kept watching until the end but i got bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida
<START> having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 i came here to pan it but after reading the other comments i haven't the heart clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age well let me not be a complete grinch it might still work for some children if they are not too media saturated and have not become visually over sophisticated e g from watching all of lotr and harry potter but if you are an adult stay miles away you will not enjoy it br br the good bits barbara kellerman as the witch especially in her early scenes with edmund creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness at the stone table she goes a bit over the top michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s perry as mr tumnus also have the kind of polished skillful acting we'd expect from the very best bbc dramas and the aslan costume works very well amazingly well considering they got the eyes just right br br the bad bits almost everything else but two areas in particular one the casting england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well peter has no gravitas or charisma and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings edmund is just whiny and lucy sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically visibly drastically wrong for this part that i can't imagine how she got the job br br two the animal costumes again it appears that they worked for some kids if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting believable characters they might be entranced by this film but to a viewer with the sophistication of say a 12 year old who's seen prisoner of azkaban when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree there will be hoots of cruel derisive laughter the costumes just do not work i could not and i think any adult or modern teen could not suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver the drawn animation later gryphons etc works better is easier to take br br so ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read or re read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination
<START> back in the forties when movies touched on matters not yet admissible in polite society they resorted to codes which supposedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while alerting those in the know to just what was up probably no film of the decade was so freighted with innuendo as the oddly obscure desert fury set in a small gambling oasis called chuckawalla somewhere in the california desert proprietress of the purple sage saloon and casino is the astonishing mary astor in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder into town drives her handful of a daughter lizabeth scott looking in technicolor like 20 million bucks but listen to the dialogue between them which suggests an older lesbian and her young restless companion one can only wonder if a i bezzerides' original script made this relationship explicit even more blatant are john hodiak as a gangster and wendell corey as his insanely jealous torpedo add burt lancaster as the town sheriff stir and sit back both lancaster and surprisingly hodiak fall for scott it seems however that hodiak not only has a past with astor but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances the desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil with face slappings aplenty and empurpled exchanges don't pass up this hothouse melodrama chock full of creepily exotic blooms if it comes your way it's a remarkable movie
<START> a reporter craig milford who works for the james keller public telecommunication center has an interview with a german professor of a floridian university who made an unknown creature based upon some substance of meteor s but then a man named anderson who is trying to control the whole planet with the creature and his man kill the professor and his assistants and plunder the creature so craig and his new female psychic partner joanna fitzgerald who can communicate not only with human being but also with alien friend s of the creature begin to find the creature and try to send it to an alien spaceship this film has some great casts and staffs for instance it has the actor david warbeck of the beyond the actress laura trotter of nightmare city the special visual effects creator sergio stivaletti of dario argento's masterpieces and the director and also the story writer alberto de martino of the man with icy eyes and the killer is on the phone and these talented people make an incredibly bad film named nothing but this miami golem which is essentially a confusedly combined film of close encounters of the third kind with e t the extra terrestrial and this not only confused but also crammed film has something worth genetic engineering with psychical research consequently the film has at least one scientific and or technical flaw genetic engineering and psychical research are never compatible strangely enough regarding this strangely childish combination of genetic engineering and psychical research the leading character craig himself says there must be a better explanation to the short haired psychic joanna but after all the whole story of the film doesn't and can't present any kind of better explanation in addition this film has something more laughable its problematic music what the composer who is credited as robert marry provides is nothing but the strangely insistent beverly hills cop tasted music i don't want to say this italianised theme of beverly hills cop per se is particularly bad music but i have to say it seems to be manifestly clear the music does not have the fitness for this film per se at all indeed just who can think beverly hills cop has the compatibility with genetic engineering and or psychical research
<START> director writer michael winner's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film although still schlock efficiently catered for which really does by go unnoticed sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material of good vs evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive if somewhat exploitative set pieces as a whole it's sketchy however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang busters with the scares actually there's always something going on amongst its busy framework but it's rather down played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation winner's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian however it's the ensemble cast that really holds it togetherÂ as you try to spot the faces there's plenty too some having more to do with the scheme of things than others but there's no doubts every one of them are committed despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all it's interesting to see names like sylvia miles who's significantly creepy beverly d'angelo likewise deborah raffin eli wallach christopher walken william hickey a neat cameo jeff goldblum jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts then you got a mild mannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads offering able support josÃ© ferrer martin balsam ava gardner john carradine burgess meredith and arthur kennedy the script does throw around many characters as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in however it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here is there a reason for all of this and why is it surrounding raines' character the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange worrying experiences she encounters when she's moves into her new apartment this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades which projects some icy moments gil melle was the man responsible for the grand overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c kratina instruments the sweeping scope like photography
<START> just saw this movie and what a waste of time the movie was predictable and slow it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball rather than watching this movie i should have had a root canal the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship funding this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball however because it's rated pg the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard thurl bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary
<START> it's a ghost story it's a cannibalism story it's a revenge story it's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence i suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen it has the usual isolated place the cocky campers heading off to the wilderness granted there are some pretty intense scenes it's just so dull bad editing and the whole works there are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket i'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by it also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife a friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous sick violence i fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution three is no cleverness here no tongue in cheek only a sad waste of time lots of blood little plot
<START> in my humble opinion this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script ok vanessa williams is good to watch but to me that's all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show chynna phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry mcafee when it's played by george wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in boston jason alexander is passable but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone as i mentioned it's good to have a version of the stage script now but i hope the young out there who have never seen a musical don't judge them all by this
<START> scoop is easily woody allen's funniest film of the 2000's so far allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as low brow magician sidney waterman his one liners and demeanor are hilarious don't let the critics sway your opinion scoop is a top notch woody lite picture br br the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit jackman is dashing the cinematography glows scoop is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
<START> the title of this movie doesn't make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because it's the sound that a retarded young man makes while he's operating his imaginary trolley which is what he does all day and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal at times tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in japan br br there are two drunks who trade wives there's a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food there's a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him and there's a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him and everyone else like dirt br br there's no particular plot to this really it's a bunch of stories that drift back forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic all in all i thought it worked pretty well i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description i was not in the least disappointed and i'd definitely recommend this 9 out of 10
<START> the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clichÃ© with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future
<START> this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace' no script since it was apparently written and added to daily no attention to camera or shots in mind poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101 how this pile got through no one can tell it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries this movie has one good part its end this film is my 1 worst film of all time finally howard the duck is no longer the goose
<START> this film is stunningly beautiful goldsworthy's art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and blossoming i strongly recommend this movie to everyone i can think of nothing else to say about it it's just the kind of movie you have to see because it's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre
<START> 'utter crap' pretty well sums up what this movie was i'd rather examine the colon of an african elephant with a penlight than sit through this again i think i've wasted enough time watching this movie i don't need to waste more by commenting on it further
<START> halloween is one of the best examples of independent film it's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores if you haven't seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all terrific i wish they had never made sequel after sequel the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie she hasn't seemed to age she's just as gorgeous today without the hairdo and seventies clothes the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever
<START> wow if you think that a film can't fatigue in some way then you haven't seen dog bite dog this film pulls no punches and it doesn't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all much like salo this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit it is gritty dark depressing and hopeless but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kong br br the script is much more of the same but don't go on thinking it is incredibly clichÃ©d it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game against a professional and emotionless hit man while the script offers nothing new on the surface it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity is violence really that necessary do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child without pity without remorse in turn we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger this is a sad truth it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores without limiting himself at all besides the cat and mouse chase the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters one is about love and the other is about redemption even if the script isn't that new it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times br br the acting is really really good edison chen as the hit man is incredible he proves that he isn't just any pretty face he is ruthless vile and beyond likable sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding the supporting cast in short is excellent the music is also worth mentioning very somber score by ben cheung with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film the cinematography by yuen man is also really good br br overall this catiii film is highly recommended very well paced incredibly acted marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all however as many have pointed out this is not a movie for everyone if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one if you don't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn't for you too in the end a powerhouse film 8 10
<START> the first cruel intentions the original is my favorite movie of all time it was an absolute masterpiece so how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad sarah michelle gellar was perfect in the first movie in this one amy adams sucks she is terrible and couldn't they have found a chick who actually looked like sarah michelle gellar at least the same hair color i mean come on robin dunn isn't as bad as adams but he is absolutely terrible when compared to ryan phillipe the sebastian in the first film is devious deceitful and much more evil than the sebastian in the prequel and what is up with the story line it basically goes like this br br 1 sebastian has a bad rep at his first school so the movie says although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life and how he has been with girls 2 sebastian moves to new york and just suddenly decides he's going to turn himself around he falls in love with danielle might i remind you that in the original sarah michelle giller says quote you broke up with the first person you ever loved because i said to so how can he have been in love in the prequel and he's all nice and charming and all good person as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing br br 3 he does a complete 180 and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie and then seducing cherry br br i mean its terrible and i loved the first one so much i haven't even seen the third one yet i hope to god its better than this prequel
<START> return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone
<START> very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice gruesome make up effects daniella is a beautiful twenty something girl carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf she kills her brother in law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital she escapes again however and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives doctors and relatives it's all pretty to look at and listen too really great soundtrack but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast luckily enough leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire the film is too long too weird and too forgettable the biggest surprise comes at the end when suddenly and out of the blue director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts yeah right
<START> this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom br br the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful i just sat in utter amazement during this movie thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining br br the producers of this movie were very clever they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think woody harrison kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie boy are they in for a horrible time br br if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning
