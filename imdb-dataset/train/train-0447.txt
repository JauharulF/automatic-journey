<START> guy ritchie's noble effort is beat up knocked down raped kicked around shot stabbed spit upon punched sodomized and abused and left for dead by madonna's dreadful performance her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the al gore school of dramatics and public speaking guy ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this and if you exclude all of the scenes that his wife was in it's a fair movie at best i think that the best acting job ever had to be guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re shoot if you have an opportunity of watching swept away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes go for the extended pedicure
<START> this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself i first saw the trailer in 1991 it looked great since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it until today yes 14 years later br br lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal ok i knew it wouldn't be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no brain film in the bloodsport mold unfortunately it was not it's pooh br br whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening br br the fight scenes were rubbish and look fake br br this dvd only cost me Â£5 and i believe i was overcharged by Â£7 br br now i'm sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back
<START> bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this made for tv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is it's emotionally rather flat it's difficult to form an attachment to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the self serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but it's definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavy handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties 7 10

<START> i thought this movie was excellent for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business it was packed with action and a little romance but there were some points when corrine didn't speak very clearly when she threatened sean with the gun and she clenched her teeth maybe she was supposed to i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well and there was an obvious contrast also because i watched next action star i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts which were performed very well i am looking forward to another movie by the pair as they make a great team or perhaps a sequel to bet your life possibly called 'making it big in the big apple' it could this time be about carmen bet your life is excellent
<START> can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful boringus maximus the plot is well hidden in several sub levels of nebulosity i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead
<START> this film is the worst film but it ranks very high for me it is how a slasher movie should be it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers it is filled with good catholic priest sexually repressed humor bad hair bad clothes the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad i recommend this film for a fun time get a case of cheap beer and some friends watch it and laugh
<START> i absolutely love this game to death ever since i was 9 years old i am now 15 it has great graphics characters magic weapons additions and don't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms i am still waiting for a remake prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game br br you play as dart a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element such as fire darkness water ice thunder lightning earth light and wind there are also items known as dragoon spirits which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend dragons wizards creatures called winglies and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action packed thrills and excitement one of my all time favorite games the legend of dragoon
<START> i could not believe the low 5 6 rating on imdb about johnny dangerously at the moment i wrote this review and i thought i had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as i can seriously to get a rating so low the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor not to mention a very shallow opened mind if you don't like humorous flicks don't watch them combining absurd humour a very good storytelling and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags this movie has made its way into my dvd collection and that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course the use of clin d'oeils and clichÃ©s based on our favorite organized crime movies br br i showed this movie to a lot of people and being introduced to it without any specific expectations except maybe watching a comedy the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion they all liked it very much it goes well it's not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story which i think is really straightforward sure it's not perfect some gags fall a bit short but no movie is perfect especially when considering other opinions that yours that is why i rated this movie 9 out of 10 this movie is in my opinion a precursor like top secret and spaceballs in the field of absurd but well thought comedies which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly if at all as a final word i would like to say watch it for yourself do not follow average joe's saying and if you don't like it then you'll know for real it was not good for your tastes which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion
<START> 'five days' is billed as something special a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes each set on one particular day of a police enquiry but in fact this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories in fact one almost can't help drawing comparisons to the last 'prime suspect' as one of the sub plots focuses on a single cynical female cop approaching retirement and it's not just the absence of helen mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable there's a lot of earnest over emoting manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic in another suspicious and it's possible to guess the guilty party well before the end not because of the internal dynamic of the story but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times in spite of these failings the series grew on me by the end i was quite gripped but it's a sad sign that the bbc which once made the likes of 'the singing detective' boasted of this of possibly the best drama of the year for there's little true originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing 'five days' is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh
<START> charles boyer is supposed to be spanish and he's come to london to buy coal in confidential agent a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall katina paxinou peter lorre dan seymour and wanda hendrix boyer is luis denard and everyone is out to stop him except bacall his papers are stolen he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists br br this film has its good and not so good points it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense and it is highly entertaining bacall is incredibly beautiful boyer is passionate paxinou is mean lorre is slimy hendrix appropriately pathetic and seymour outrageously wonderful br br the not so good points bacall is supposed to be english and boyer spanish uh no boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent but bacall is 100 american not of the british upper class the two have no chemistry conclusion bacall is somewhat miscast her acting isn't up to snuff either she's better in other films but she's an astonishing looking woman and much can be forgiven br br paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature it's a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good this was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors seymour wasn't a small actor br br definitely worth seeing even with its flaws
<START> with a bo derek movie the audience get just what they expect a paper thin plot and a few shots of mrs derek in no clothes 'ghosts can't do it' is just that the first fifteen minutes is ordinary tv drama as long as scott anthony quinn is still alive he is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes bo derek is the opposite always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes the movie is a complete waste of time if you want to see quinn rent lawrence of arabia or la strada if you want to see nude women or bad acting rent any porno movie
<START> unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you an attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it doesn't work br br when salma hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her br br the documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history br br no one with the exception of mikey myers could be accused of acting however he does an incredible job
<START> exquisite comedy starring marian davies with the affable william haines young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom cameo performances showcase all the stars in mgm's heaven in the famous commissary scene plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar pic also captures for posterity davies' famous wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day her swanson is a beaut br br peggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis turns up her nose and comments ohh i don't like her br br my print was perfect story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados
<START> as a long time fan of superman from the comics through the 1950s series the first two of the chris reeves films and lois clark and finally smallville i was really hoping for something clever with superman returns br br instead we got lex luthor making another attempt at real estate conversion another superman beaten up while wearing kryptonite sequence and internal inconsistencies he couldn't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 of kryptonite but when lois breaks off 3 of it leaving the rest embedded in him he can lift a continent into space really the only hero in the story was lois' partner i can't remember his name off hand he did all kinds of life saving heroic things with nothing but guts and skill no superpowers no invulnerability just a normal human br br they keep making superman so small why can't we have superman battling brainiac or fighting to save the universe from general zod instead of lex's petty schemes oh i forgot they're doing that in smallville br br yeah i think i'll stick to smallville br br you probably should too
<START> dumbland is not for all in fact dumbland maybe in for nobody except lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon violent yes profanity yes absurd yes a piece of garbage never dumbland is a wonderful picture of some americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun from mÃ©xico i can say i love it my favorite episodes are 1 my teeths are bleeding all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed 2 get the stick yeah baby get it and learn a lesson some people never be thankful for your actions 3 ants the more lynch episode of all music surrealism and a very sweet revenge
<START> a worn out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case the equally worn out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out br br with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behavior br br the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture br br a regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss
<START> for years madonna has tried to prove not only herself but the public eye that she can act unfortunately trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well br br she seems to fare better when she's not the star of any movie if you watch her in supporting performances in desperately seeking susan 1985 or a league of their own 1992 she actually comes off looking good since the story revolves on other actors the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default br br the trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie regardless the genre being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way whether it be good mediocre or plain awful she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance this is the crucial difference between madonna and let's say bette davis or meryl streep the latter two even if the movie were to fail because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it or because the script fell short or because the actress per se was just not at her moment there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb both davis and streep have had their share bette having a longer career than streep in such fare as bunny o'hare 1971 and wicked stepmother 1989 streep in she devil 1989 but at least there's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance br br madonna on the other hand not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself fares much worse and even in the hands of someone as woody allen in shadows and fog 1992 an inferior classic she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff maybe even nervous as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go br br so here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two character movie guy ritchie more known for action movies filled in masculine energy seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of michaelangelo antonioni or ingmar bergman who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease and at 89 minutes the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn it doesn't feel sincere from being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since fay dunaway's laura suddenly discovered her passion for tommy lee jones in the eyes of laura mars 1978 equally unconvincing is adriano giannini's nasty turn around the middle of the movie it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic and when he gives in to madonna's love it's too quick to be believed filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this transformation from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other br br trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well it only makes it drag bog it down and when madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close up it feels she's trying too hard many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion br br could the movie have been better of course there are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again it's been done before in overboard 1987 for example it could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change to ensure a moral tone much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more silent film look as in persona 1966 it could have even been something of a thriller providing that the giannini character have a mean streak as billy zane had in dead calm 1989 even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for madonna as the over the top uber control freak getting her comeuppance but with its mean streaked humor without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom and without really defining giannini's own character this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes
<START> this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life and i've seen some pretty bad movies i didn't like the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but it's absolutely horrible i've never seen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no plot it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming the story is too weird i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no point in even filming this movie if you're considering watching this movie don't you're just wasting your time
<START> i'd never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i'd give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight not how i'd imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vine br br oh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey cheeta was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good br br probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan 4 10
