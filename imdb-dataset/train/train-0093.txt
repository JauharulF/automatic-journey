<START> from the stupid quaint african natives travelogue footage with our badly superimposed principals acting as narrators to the horrible fake ears which transform docile indian elephants into african elephants to the utter lack of any logic at all to maureen o'sullivan's incessant whining of tarzan tarzan there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status br br 4 10
<START> an excellent interpretation of jim thompson's novel this neo noir thriller has all the requisite elements deranged ex boxer turned drifter alcoholic widow with sinister desires ex cop turned small time crook and a kidnap plot destined for doom yet the film never crosses into cliche country but remains fresh and intriguing the performances are all superb particularly bruce dern's role as the wicked sleazeball uncle bud there is a tense uncertainty to the film's movement which intentional or not adds to the grim proceedings highly recommended
<START> this film is a travesty no wait an abomination no wait this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors br br i thought inspector clouseau with alan arkin instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious but even daring to remake stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money grubbing br br mr laurel and mr hardy have been dead respectively since 1957 and 1965 why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn't disappointed everyone involved in this pathetic moronic disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film making avoid this movie at all costs you have been duly warned
<START> this is a bizzare look at al's life back when he still a hyper 20 something the real home videos of al as a kid are great and the commentary from his real life parents gives a nice glimpse of just how weird al wound up as screwed up as he is this video is a must own for any devoted al coholic
<START> this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesn't make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie ever br br don't watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror action and crime br br don't let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people
<START> genteel softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre a departure from his normal adventure fantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success schindler's list br br based upon alice walder's pulitzer prize winning novel the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie while the plot about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes' scrambling screenplay the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walker's novel a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director br br performances are strong throughout with whoopi goldberg making a debut which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved danny glover lends solid support though his moses was a superior turn for him in places in the heart the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman good support also from margaret avery adolph caesar and rae dawn chong br br quincy jones co producer with spielberg kathleen kennedy and frank marshall has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion editing from michael kahn is sound as always while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery br br this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions br br wednesday january 15 1997 video
<START> actor herman josÃ© plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica club of its heart fc porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north south of portugal fc porto benfica highly recommended
<START> if i hadn't been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes and even then i admit i fast forwarded through parts the '63 film version was vastly superior in all regards yes i've read this one is more faithful to the original play but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in '63 it's overlong it drags the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative the version of kids in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor in this version the kim is way too old the conrad is absolutely horrible to behold when someone ripped his shirt off him i shuttered in disgust the director of this version has no idea what sexy is this conrad can't dance can't sing he can't even stay in tune and is simply repulsive if elvis presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began as for the other actors well i kept waiting for alexander's toupee to fall off as he danced and daly was totally over acting as momma see stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time
<START> the odd couple is a comic gem one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid exceeded only by strangelove spinal tap and lebowski lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy irresponsible oscar oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude felix's wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar thats when the fun begins br br the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one liners you are probably already familiar with the f u joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthau's comic timing br br my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element this one requires repeat viewings
<START> janeane garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film calling it among other things anti feminist she has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she doesn't believe in them i wholeheartedly agree with janeane here this film is a trifle at best she does her best but overall it was just another boring unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from hollywood janeane's character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness which makes her look unattractive while uma's character is filmed in lighter tones which probably displeased janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film that really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two as many have said here and on other comment threads janeane is not ugly but in fact quite beautiful i haven't read one review where someone said uma was better looking having said that though i believe that ben chaplin's character would more than likely stay with uma not janeane many men don't like really intelligent women and many women don't like really intelligent men and sadly ben probably would have stayed with uma and despite the director's attempt to make janeane unattractive it doesn't work her natural beauty comes through anyway br br i think a lot of janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the ben chaplin character and actually scoring with janeane janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here real life is always much more complex than hollywood can imagine so take a cold shower gentlemen this is the role that janeane is best known for and that's a shame as this really isn't that good of a film
<START> this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery no one could have done it better the suspense was palpable throughout i wish mr wilder would grace us with another of these i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw murder in a small town and this follow on he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant acting his subtle wit comes through in spades i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and or gene wilder's film work his star just gets brighter and brighter
<START> well it turned out as i expected visual overload but nothing else added to the original what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick initially this awoke my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood like product and b made the whole storyline improbable the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward and included no time storms or any bogus of that sort it just stated that when you come home after a long journey things might have changed a bit earth might have fallen in the hands of apes for example like many 'old' movies it's main ingredient was suspense hell does anyone understand that word these days in this burton movie an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie but at what cost surely the images are overwhelming and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape culture even ape music but what's wrong br br first the suspension of disbelief is made very hard because the apes have a lot of hollywood human traits i refer especially to ari and the slave trader these traits include emotional skills like irony sarcasm and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions it makes you forget that the apes are apes which is essential br br second the humans talk of course we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape human role switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr zira has in him so no need for things like human rights activists or ape human love in order to explain things br br third the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility but is a necessary twist in the new movie since capt davidson has to play the hollywood let's save the whole world and have a good ending for everyone and still make it to the lounge bar for a cool diet coke character oh my god will they never learn i new it from the start when there was only one guy who got lost they were in need of a hero and then the script writers go on reasoning we need one guy so why would one guy get lost because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm implausible but it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes since in these modern and politically correct times we can't have a xenophobic ape hater like charlton heston's 68 character loose on the screen let's give them a bubblegum version br br fourth okay the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab apes developed their society where heston simply discovered that just somehow the apes overtook the earth while he was away is nicely done the second battle part comes as an anti climax that's because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot nice try but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle part br br fifth the ending for chrissakes who came up with that a davidson crashes twice with his escape pod which seems an unsteerable object while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully come on who'd believe that if the pods are really small space crafts davidson simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape vessels he might have managed a safe landing at least once no and what about that ending i mean in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth but here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same there's a thade statue ape culture is on earth how come did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidson's mission took off why is thade worshiped stupid stupid stupid br br helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape but i'd expected no less i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human but maybe i got some loose wire in my head nevertheless the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade wonderful and ari's household ape the ex general but i forgot his name br br nonono a lot of things could and should have been added altered to the 1968 pic but not the plot at least not in that way it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining it was nicely tongue in cheek and caricatured don't stylize everything
<START> i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph
<START> a low point in human interaction was reached by the maysles brothers with this film do remember you who used words like masterpiece when reviewing this film that these maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people no when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation these wretched maysles smiled kissed ass did whatever they had to to get the beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done one would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt but the film making process given the preplanning actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the beales as human beings an exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people as time accrued their film making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here their reputation as human beings is execrable that is what people will remember them as grotesque hustlers
<START> effect s without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of hollywood remakes not only is it possible it's required the haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st class cinematographer turner director who once showed promise jan de bont speed but has since produced a string of big budget garbage twister speed 2 br br actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film lili taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing events just happen good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity br br there really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake
<START> ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t a with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play t a nough said
<START> don't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film simply put as regards ninja movies this my friends is about as good as it gets br br yes it's silly yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious but by gum it's so much bloody fun in fact as is often the case with b movies the horrendous 'acting' which in the case of the movie in question is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold and ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold br br obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i'm pleased to say they're very well choreographed especially the final showdown during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity br br trust me on this if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre
<START> very very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise it didn't take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70's very average yet credible acting from most involved and a plot line with potential las vegas lady lays one big boring egg it seems forever for the film to kick into gear and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up i was somewhat disappointed with this film sure i wasn't expecting anything great but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70's or something like it not even close no one dies there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument beyond that nothing in terms of action and as for the girls don't expect much there either stella and her girls both very mediocre yet pretty talents get in a sauna and a bath what do we see nothing but a fleeting side profile stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film alas it was not to be and i have little to say in this film's favor it isn't a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either yawn
<START> after a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy then the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the warm feeling might still be there but as others has said the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch br br the movie gets sped up and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out br br realism isn't a goal onto itself but as a viewer i'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic it just happens to be br br on the plus side this movie has a couple of nice interiors and despite the bad script i think that the actors performances are mainly good if i could rate the first 25 minutes only i'd probably give it an eight as it is now it gets a four and that's being nice br br if you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways if not i'd recommend that you watch something else
<START> this movie is a classic in every sense of the word it is very entertaining and also very disturbing the acting in this movie is well done the story itself is believable suspenseful and well thought out character development is also done well the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film the villains in this movie are very threatening from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something this movie shows how a human being when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it not everyone is going to like this film there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable it is definitely worth watching this movie is a masterpiece
