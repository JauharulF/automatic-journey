<START> spoilers 9 11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc 2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it before 9 11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most grueling moment in the documentary then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody's memory i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch 10 10
<START> first off consider that this film is nearly fifty years old yet it still stands up as one of the great films of all time i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050 br br the story is simple yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day i can still recall the first time i watched this as a kid when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first and only time had me shivering in fear i can tell you looks dated today but still more than effective enough br br the scenes with the tiger show their age now you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira but they are only just visible br br likewise the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done br br it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies as a young but still mature man he was 30 when this film came out nearly 80 now br br all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come timeless
<START> seven pounds this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the i'm going to make you cry films one thing i can give him a ton of credit for the man can cry my only thing is as moving as the story is will smith has proved time and time again that he can act so why is he taking this extremely depressing story but nevertheless it's still a good movie i do have to admit it made me cry but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson i absolutely love this girl ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton i knew this girl was going to go far she's beautiful charming funny and talented can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go but her and will smith not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film br br two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash which was caused by him using his mobile phone seven people died six strangers and his fiancÃ©e a year after the crash and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer tim donates a lung lobe to his brother ben an irs employee six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations he finds george a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help she suggests connie tepos who lives with an abusive boyfriend tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish one night after being beaten connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house she takes her two children and moves in to their new home having stolen his brother's credentials and making himself known by his brother's name ben he checks out candidates for his two final donations the first is ezra turner a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy he then contacts emily posa a self employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type he spends time with her weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation br br seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look i would just recommend going for the rental vs the theater will smith pulls in a good performance but not his best just most of the film required him crying in every scene but the last one with him is a doozy but i loved the ending it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story br br 7 10
<START> when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt try not to gag on a fur ball br br i like albert brooks i've seen most if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance although 1979's chilly scenes of winter comes very close they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted obsessed to their respective women br br where as chilly scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship and out of the relationship and back in it again br br and because it's a movie that was released in 1981 it is of its time in terms of styles and such that's the main reason i like this movie my basic rule when it comes to movies is if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance you know time capsule stuff br br which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirt br br the man is hair very hair like he's wearing a black curly fur sweater hairy and what's worse is he almost looks burn victim hairy it's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting sorry albert i wish at some point someone said hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t shirt i mean you might scare people it's just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers she was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that br br anyway it's an ok movie it could have been better if i hadn't see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie
<START> sad story of a downed b 17 pilot brady is shot down over occupied territory the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours after the film is over i'm glad i took the time it's an entire story told to explain the look on brady's face at the start of the film
<START> well i just ordered this on my pay per view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh i have to admit i did chuckle a few times but i don't even remember what parts they were at i don't understand why this movie was made it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly i don't find a singing penis or a naked 70 year old woman very funny this movie was trying to fit itself into the 'gross out' comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip but it just failed miserably it was way to much gross out then it was comedy also why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well done besides that avoid this movie 3 10
<START> in 1948 this was my all time favorite movie betty grable's costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that douglas fairbanks jr was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women i saw it again the other day i was surprised to find that it still did
<START> the tenants began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud writer philosopher examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green who also directs it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments br br harry lesser dylan mcdermott is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel seymour cassel who constantly tries to 'buy out' harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasi anti semitic writer willie spearmint snoop dogg whom harry befriends hides and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people harry's attempts to help willie lead to conflict not the least of which is harry's meeting willie's girlfriend the white jewish irene bell rose byrne at a less than friendly gathering of willie's militant black brothers and sisters willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers the ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and undoing' br br the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters the cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings the film in the end is worth watching at least it attempts to recreate malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city grady harp
<START> i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film and crispin glover's film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is shirly temple the anti christ which i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing snails crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged peta and human rights should be all over this thing it's not 'counter culture' as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival it's exploitation
<START> tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be healed through radical techniques that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture to release the pent up demons inside them br br the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor eriksson group the above mentioned cult group the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film the rest of it plays out like a mindf ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix full frontal nudity some gore to keep you happy br br i say check this out may not be spectacular but it's concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots 8 10
<START> i went into deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller and while that's something like what this film is i also can't help but think that it's just a poor man's sleuth the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film not particularly in terms of the plot but certainly it's the case with the execution the casting of michael caine in the central role just confirms it the film is based on a play by ira levin who previously wrote rosemary's baby and the stepford wives and focuses on sidney bruhl a playwright whose best days are behind him after his latest play bombs sidney finds himself at a low and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap written by an amateur he taught arrives on his doorstep deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success and sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own which involves inviting round the amateur scribe killing him and then passing deathtrap off as his own work br br despite all of its clever twists and turns deathtrap falls down on one primary element and that's the characters the film fails to provide a single likable character and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players this is not helped by the acting michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect but nobody else does themselves proud christopher reeve is awkward in his role while dyan cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance it's lucky then that the story is good and it is just about good enough to save the film the plot features plenty of twists and turns some work better than others but there's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus the central location is interesting in its own right and the cinematography fits the film well overall i have to admit that i did enjoy this film but it could have been much much better
<START> the movie was terrible easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question what is the worst movie you have seen answer celestine prophecy trust me i read the book enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie but then they treated the audience like we are r tarded there is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence it is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow they didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died it was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie the book is pretty boring too but i enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book the film does not offer the same opportunity and i would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart don't see this movie trust me
<START> paul hennessy and his wife cate must deal with their two teenage daughters and weird son but after the untimely passing of john ritter the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one br br i found this show passing through the channels one afternoon and i have to say i was laughing myself till my ribs ached simply at the range of characters the witty lines and the situation paul would find himself dealing mostly with his daughters from then on i caught the rest of the show when i was free and i have to say the writing was very good but then i read about john ritter's death shortly afterwards i watched 'goodbye' part 2 and i have to say i was nearly in tears watching the emotions of the characters losing a loved one how rory punches a wall in anger and frustration how cate deals with having to sleep in her bed all alone briget and kerry talking about what they should have done br br but the show does move on bringing with it jim egan and cj barnes who provide great laughs as cate's father tries to protect his family and give 'man issue talks' to rory but the true gem is cj who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin br br it will always be john ritter's masterpiece
<START> this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities br br the film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in 1944 the war ended in may 1945 in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama br br all in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall it's a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film br br fyi this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not true previously he'd been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger
<START> people i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about despite the game efforts of a talented cast br br pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman a past his prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate br br the film traces eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a client's ryan o'neal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry in this case a tv actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script doesn't give her much to work with as eli's sister in law kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics br br this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to dvd consider yourself warned
<START> the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i've ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh br br this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic bat man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit they just aren't funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer's ineptness at comedy br br keep the underground comedy movie underground bury it
<START> this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie don't make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there's 1 enemy left ok damn it this movie sucks i can 't believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya
<START> the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to study dig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist br br the movie is just that a low budget b movie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along you'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a one man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one on one and it's supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isn't well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else br br the verdict 2 of 5 stars
<START> this movie is goofy as hell i think it was written as a serious film but then when it came time to film michael cooney said hey let's throw in some humor and spice it up the characters are actually slightly developed too oh and the death sequences are the best one thing i hate though was the hairdryer weapons what was that all about
<START> this movie was recommended to me by a friend i never saw an ad or a trailer so i didn't know clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small i thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty enjoyable all in all the opening scene with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road looking whipped and haggard caught my attention immediately it had a way of telling you don't go away this won't be boring and it really wasn't it turned out to be an interesting light hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end but when the ending did arrive i felt a little bit cheated just a little bit the events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building but at a point that i can't define it sort of levels out making the ending a slight disappointment i reckon i expected a bigger bang of a climax but it turned out sort of low key if you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high dosages of george clooney you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching now i'd like to see the original big deal on madonna street but it's probably a rare find in the united states
