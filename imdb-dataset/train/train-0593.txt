<START> youth sexuality and the french countryside one of the more unique films you're ever going to see if you can see it that is no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it a combination of scarcity and censorship it's sometimes erotic sometimes disgusting and occasionally funny a trifle boring also in the middle but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you've seen this one at least once
<START> the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake unbeknownst to the locals a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake the meteor heats the lake turning it into a giant incubator you guessed it the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community br br what utter garbage it's not that i mind the stop motion clay dinosaur it's everything else about the movie that bothers me the acting is atrocious the dialogue is utterly ridiculous the comic relief is anything but comic logic is non existent any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie but you get the idea i feel it's fairly safe to call this disaster mst3k worthy
<START> this movie is so bad it can only be compared to the all time worst comedy police academy 7 no laughs throughout the movie do something worthwhile anything really just don't waste your time on this garbage
<START> this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy's law being applied to home ownership and construction if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional since it was set in the 'simpler' forties we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment 7 10
<START> now i'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie br br that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory br br however the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading it is also offensive br br i am a quarter cree indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of whitaker's character first of all he's a black guy and this isn't a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents the katana represents the soul of a samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a katana anyway it must be one of those replicas which insults the samurai caste even more br br also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it's more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates none the less br br then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master br br everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido br br so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushi samurai holds dear br br 2 5 10 bleah
<START> panic in the streets is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as a streetcar named desire on the waterfront and east of eden kazan already won an oscar in 1947 before this movie so he was not a completely unknown at the time still panic in the streets is mostly a movie that passed under the radar br br the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime film noir elements the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility br br the cast is fairly unknown especially at the time it was released but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles especially palance impresses as the tough gangster boss with a very powerful looking face br br still the movie drags a little at some points the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from br br yet panic in the streets remains a perfectly watchable movie mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch br br 8 10
<START> at last i've finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now i've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the '90's with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible br br this was the lovely meena kumari's film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on finally realising it in 1971 what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face br br the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but i'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india it's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me it's the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding i've seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin' in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata br br because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
<START> by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers harry dodge and silas howard they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it's beautifully shot by ann t rosetti and wonderfully written truly poetic br br the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere this film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it i can't recommend it highly enough br br the best butch buddy movie of all time
<START> ned kelly ledger the infamous australian outlaw and legend sort of like robin hood with a mix of billy the kid australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression and united the lower classes to change australia forever the fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70 immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film indeed quite a few so called facts' in this film are on reflection a tad dubious br br i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when in the opening credits it was claimed that this film is based upon the book our sunshine' if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book there it was this wasn't going to be a historical epic but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version br br unfortunately ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical drama' wannabe the story plods along at an alarming rate alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner's awful wyatt earp all those years ago simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good because the direction sure as heck wasn't however unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent then you're gonna be disappointed between that the game of who has the stupidest beard ' spot the obvious backstabber ' clue they are all ginger for some reason and nature in australia including lions' it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark the history channel discovery channel and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover yup nature pops up a lot as to fill even more time possibly an attempt to look arty the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots and once all the native species are shown here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people br br this is a turgid emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv there isn't even one good word i can say about this film even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head
<START> we tend to forget that the master slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well tended estates powered by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for the white owners it lead to a group of people caught in the middle the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves br br some of these children just became more slaves and others were free but free and coloured which back then meant anything but relative to the lot of their sires br br a class formed around these offspring the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour and that class was able to a certain extent to own property raise themselves from downtrodden to educated and to attain a comparative dignity that is to say they weren't slaves but they were still exploited to a certain extent br br often the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth set up in their own houses with allowances schooling paid for for their children and a kind of gentility dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families in essence they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from labour an arrangement called plaÃ§age br br feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched on their lives in both a negative and a positive way the tale was an eye opener for me a new zealander with no real conception of the black white lines let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly br br the characters are very three dimensional and have been well rendered in this adaption of the novel by anne rice the parts are well cast the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way the lines are drawn out with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites the slaves could not help themselves and the whites even the sympathetic ones couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on br br i recommend this story both the novel and the miniseries to everyone unreservedly if you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and cower through some parts as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour both by their white oppressors and by their own people bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it br br i know it may sound callous but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on and i thoroughly enjoyed it watch it if not read up on the period because there's a lesson to be learned from it all
<START> this could have been a good episode but i simply had to turn it off the british representation was horrible to watch have the makers ever set foot in britain prior to filming at least set foot in england i don't think any british person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of the royal family also with the 2 english boys well i don't think any english boy has acted spoke or dressed like any english kid in the history of the british nation since prince william and harry's preteen public appearances to american film makers there is more than 1 country in the uk england wales scotland and northern ireland meaning more than 1 culture i can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad i could not watch it fire looked cool though
<START> if you are a fan of altman's large ensemble casts as evidenced in major films like m a s h nashville gosford park and lesser seen films like a wedding then you will no doubt be entertained by health centered around a health convention where two women are running for president health contains many of altman's latter 70s regulars like paul dooley who helped write the film carol burnett and henry gibson while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall james garner and glenda jackson like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding rather it has a more centered feel perhaps like m a s h or gosford park the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement filled with over top outlandish contradictive characters with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing underlining the whole election process is altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having this would be one of altman's last films like this for a while
<START> fabulous actors beautiful scenery stark reality i won't elaborate on all of the other reviewers' comments because you get the picture however the movie isn't for the squeamish reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive i also have elinore randall stewart's homestead book i read it several years ago i have to reread it since i just watched the newly released remastered dvd of the movie br br i tried to buy the video for several years finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business but yippee the dvd is now for sale i purchased it on amazon com not cheap but well worth it to me this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days
<START> this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did i think that laurel goes to the prisoner of zenda but it is surely the most depressing sellers especially sans makeup as nayland smith looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy as fu manchu he looks hardly better and spends most of the film with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup the supporting players also look tired and run down and sid caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to chinks one bright spot this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray asians so insultingly or for that matter star a non asian as one the film seems surprisingly cheap with soupy photography and drab sets even the whiz bang elvis number at the end looks cut rate only the stunning helen mirren and the tall thin nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair all in all this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic's death and an even eerier documentation of his dying
<START> this is actually a pretty bad film the ideology is not as perverse as in those films collins made later however my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an ex sas man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists who later become pretty clueless fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale overall i think who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of collins' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier of fortune or army films pity because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that's still successful
<START> john thaw is a an excellent actor i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of london wwii time era br br that being said the film is also excellent a very moving story with a satisfying ending some of the characters are a little underdeveloped the school teacher in particular but none of them are essential to the plot basically the story is about the old man and the boy and the film needs little else
<START> the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen i can watch and re watch the tape 100 times i laugh my a off and i cry on some moments it is really good and funny movie and if you like brooks this is a must in short brooks billionare gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor the reality bites but in the end it is about warm relations between humans hightly recommend
<START> this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanley's ancestors' stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
<START> warning avoid this super duper awful movie if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed br br pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy just not working at all pam and denise act so horribly in this movie br br plus the script is absolutely atrocious i can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas with the development of movie industry movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too br br stay away from it i think watch white chicks from 2004 it's so much better that this make no mistake at that time i thought that's the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80's i went to see this movie i wasted my money the plot was very thin also the movie could not keep me interested for long i was glad it was over br br if you want to see inspector gadget watch the cartoon instead it was much better than the movie
