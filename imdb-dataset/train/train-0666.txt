<START> what a delightful film br br accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman's lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year br br incredible casting br br gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith br br the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson's mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost br br the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over br br the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend br br i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself br br i adored it
<START> i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working evenings i managed to catch some recordings of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series watching the dvd you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes thing is with the way society has come in the last century you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult oriented show the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life it's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny good job dreamworks perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though hmm
<START> i'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about vietnam and were never there this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war as the rodney king beating is true about all police officers yes bad things do and did happen but in general the people there are just like you and me they have morals they are not killing machines they do not all do drugs atrocities were the exception in vietnam not the rule they happened far more infrequently than the hype would lead you believe oliver stone has a knack for making movies that show the vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath but are based as much in reality as star wars if you honestly believe the stereotypes of vietnam do yourself a favour and learn the truth fact the viet cong and nva did far worse things to the south vietnamese than any soldier in the us armed forces ever did fact the soldiers in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in vietnam did and they were welcomed when they came home the fine americans who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint no one could have asked for more from our soldiers and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of mostly true fiction is the way things really were there
<START> well i saw this movie yesterday and it's unfortunately worse than you could think first of all the plot is idiotic it has no sense at all the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues the audience was laughing many times and the suspense is very low actors play so so with an exception of sharon stone who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like i want to beep you and it looks like let's say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all that erotic tension from bi1 is totally gone from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie better than typical straight to dvd but on a far lower lever than the original movie for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly the director of basic instinct 2 is no paul verhoeven and it shows the new composer is no jerry goldsmith and its shows the script is done by people who are no match for joe eszterhas there's no substitute for michael douglas in it the film looks cheap and badly edited at times i'm sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break thru in the popular cinema it was provoking sexy and controversial it had the best sharon stone's performance in her career it had this specific paul verhoeven's style unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories it's a pity that they made this film
<START> this movie took the jerry springer approach to super human power wilder napalm is the kind of theme based movie that i love addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every prodigy is only human and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight satiric edge
<START> predictable told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia 70's style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times i couldn't help chuckling to myself br br i usually like defoe and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad the plot develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time its just that it's all too predictable i felt like i was watching a made for tv drama instead of a new movie maybe thats the style the directors wanted but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production br br don't expect too much and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema i would wait for the bargain bins at your video shop i'm sure it wont take long
<START> no this isn't a sequel to the fabulous ova series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim and the disappearance of woodchuck it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and shiris are reintroduced and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this 27 part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining 19 episodes introduce us to spark a blue haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer br br while it isn't quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard don't we this tv follow up is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss this 27 part series has its elements of appeal the fully realized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll all give this uneven spin off some punch br br while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in 1999 2000 for the most part the lodoss tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return including lisa ortiz as deedlit which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy regan's more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting he doesn't do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some anti dub fans to instantly diss the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less bothersome i don't know if it's because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the oav dub returns jayce reeves only voices wagnard terrifically for one episode he's replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show who gives a scratchy but still malevolent turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony cruise's kashue on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenes br br aside from lisa ortiz deedlit karen smith shiris john knox ashram and al muscari slayn the dub's best voices come from some of the newer characters including crispin freeman spark maar garrack episodes 16 27 roxanne beck little neese meg frances who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla and especially angora deb who steals every scene she's in as leaf the half elf the rest of the cast isn't terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the oav dub some are all right aldonova greevus while others are lackluster hobb palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince reona's va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice br br in fact the lack of aural continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven synchronization and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the lodoss island segments these offbeat super deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty admittingly i at first found them to be a major nuisance but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as i'm king kashue and this is my cashew i'm really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as ok br br if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents in particular the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho hayami of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a respectably good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesn't always live up to its predecessor yet there's enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime
<START> i was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment tom long walked into shot the whole 'bad boy' thing it was just addictive br br the story has you hooked what will happen next will joey get the girl in the end after doing 5 years in prison and all that time thinking about his lost love crossing paths with her again finding he has a son although he is a violent bad guy you still want him to find happiness br br a truly captivating two parter please bring it out on video
<START> it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween as a kid i remember i really enjoyed the sequels especially the return of michael myers which i still think is the best halloween sequel but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the pointÂ­ i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong today i truly understand this film the meaning it has the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece it's not about blood and gore it's not about naked chicks and lame jokes it's about the worst night in laurie strode's short life it's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well it's also one of the first slasher movies a horror sub genre that i always loved halloween has a very dark atmosphere creepy music and talented young actors such as jamie lee curtis in her first role need i say more anyone who's never seen it horror fan or not should do his cinematic homework right now very highly recommended
<START> omigosh this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever ever seen to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement and i have seen heaps considering the limited availability in new zealand that's quite a lot but never before have i had to sleep with the light on until i saw the grudge br br some may say that it is a rip off of the ring both based on japanese horror movies both similar yet different story lines but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie seeing at at the cinema i even screamed at a certain point in the movie br br the acting is great particularly from the supporting characters kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show she is such an enthusiastic person jason behr is a real hottie and william mapother looks like he is having fun however while i am normally a fan of clea duvall's she doesn't really seem into this movie of the supporting characters hers probably got the most depth and back story but she doesn't seem like she is all there as for sarah michelle gellar well she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she the ghosts were genuinely scary the music and sound effects were chilling particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment the ending was cool too br br super highly recommended 9 10
<START> just had to write that one liner but it really is i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry i've seen in recent years i have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one the script it is a weak story about a petty criminal no amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance i love kevin spacey and i hear he's gonna do another film about the general my advice is don't waste your time
<START> this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it it is earthy grounded and a film that will make you think and smile paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors finally a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it
<START> this is another north east florida production filmed mainly in and near by to fernandina beach and the kingsley plantation i was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of fernandina beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes the film is pretty and pretty bad tami erin is cute but overacts eileen brennan overacts even more good for small kids or for those who like fluff in large doses a 4 from the miller movies formula
<START> i thought i'd be locked away in a padded cell and they'd throw away the key thus is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from state of mind br br one wonders in what tangled forest paula milne and her co writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten to create this feeble whodunnit and bring such rubbish to our screens a padded cell should indeed be left available br br niamh cusack did her best as did the other actors but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this the height of absurdity has been reached and this particular state of mind is best buried and forgotten and certainly not just placed in a box and locked away in a drawer
<START> red rock west 1993 br br nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it and the dominos lead to increasing peril adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease br br is the plot over the top yes is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed almost likable killer yes does cage stand a chance well you have to watch and see it never lets up and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it on second viewing yesterday i was surprised at how well it held up how well constructed it was and how macabre and funny it was at the same time br br director ron dahl who also helped write is known more for his tv work but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots it's saved by its humor by the way and by the caricatures the bar is sleazy the cops questionable and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver
<START> stephen feinberg who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie passed away in early 2006 i met steve in portland in 1993 it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier working mostly on tv promos he asked me not to see 'tunnel vision' but it was too late i had seen it already actually i had seen it years before when it was released at that time i didn't think it was that bad a movie however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated steve admitted it was not a very good movie that said he was just a little proud of 'the proctologist' sketch
<START> while watching this piece of crap the day after i saw a 1min trailer that one minute included all all what was at least not boring to watch br br so don't waste money or time on this one get the original it's much better though the effects might not be up to date
<START> shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom die br br ok so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions that's not stubbornness that's just plain dumb br br fine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights aren't even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion i'm talking about things like lalala i'm walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
<START> extremities br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format mono br br a woman turns the tables on a would be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police in which case he could be released and attack her again br br exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough 'n' ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman 1978 will almost certainly be disappointed by extremities true farrah fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker a suitably slimy james russo but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production would their final solution hold up in a court of law maybe br br based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action acing and technical credits are fine though fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation
<START> this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films it is another solid based on a true store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i don't know but i liked the story br br the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the two br br the young man still a boy is played by jake gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments i think he's likable as are his school buddies in here it's nice to see nice kids in a modern day film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time br br the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today
