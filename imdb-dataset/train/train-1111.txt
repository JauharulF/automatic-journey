<START> normally i would never rent a movie like this because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box i rented seven movies at the same time including nightmare on elm street 5 6 and wes craven's new nightmare unfortunately when i got home i found out the videostore guy gave me the wrong tape in the box of wes craven's new nightmare i found this lame movie br br this movie is incredibly boring the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make any sense it's hard to write a good review because i have no idea what the movie was really about at the end of the movie you have more questions then answers br br on 'max power's scale of 1 to 10' i rate this movie 1 br br ps i would like to correct corinthian's review right below mine he says robert englund is ripping off lingerie riding horses naked etc the guy that did those things was mahmoud played by juliano mer not by robert englund
<START> it figures this is a french film lol with the emphasis on young girls with much older men why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing when the age difference is this great it really comes off as pervy valentina cervi is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey of zeffirelli's '68 romeo and juliet set in a similar period but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi her painting instructor looks well 50 is kind br br other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period 17th century her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age old accusation that all great artists were men she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child br br the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up because in some weird frencified way it's hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather that's sexy the truth is boring and seems too feminist politically correct br br it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after not before the rape that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy that she went on to have children oh that's boring stuff after all that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't hot like teenagers br br i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character you need to create dialog have subplots create dramatic structure certainly some details can be sacrificed it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette and a big boned one not a skinny minny or something like that but to turn her story around on her and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing it's even worse because the director is female she should be horribly ashamed of herself br br if you like this and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex you will probably like dangerous beauty with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack similarly based on heavily re written history with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit
<START> all of the x men movies were great and i mean all of them including the long hated x men 3 they had solid characters magneto and xavier were the best ones in my opinion and a good story arch br br i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie i was so disappointed br br hugh jackman is not a bad actor his best movie is the fountain although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor and his acting is not what screws the movie up br br the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot like blob or gambit which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics br br i am a fan of xmen i have read many many of their stories and this movie respected none of them none not even the continuity it doesn't respect weapon x project or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth or emma frost the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies revenge for the death of a loved one br br oh what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x2 in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces but hey this is fox this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero br br besides i had a feeling of constant dejÃ¡ vÃ¹ with this movie because wolverine's origins are already explained in x2 we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know br br i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back story because mystery is the nature of the character do we really want to know how the joker got his scars
<START> i really can't say anything bad or good about this thing its characters are likable enough it's capably produced and designed and professional looking except for that cheesy monster suit however it has no originality no ideas and nothing you haven't seen in alien predator armageddon and or outland it's just another formula cookie cutter grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster flick pretty much a waste of time
<START> this may not be the worst comedy of all time but it's close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it back br br chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snl ers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably there's not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then dead so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career br br avoid this movie like the plague br br c
<START> well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo's the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that's a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it's a bit slow it's a mix of the omen and rosemary's baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals it's a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70's even if it's nothing greatly original it's wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 9 10
<START> it is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of marxism from the berlin wall to the gulag archipelago to the cultural revolution to the khmer rouge one still finds admirers of communist totalitarianism in hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor it just shows the moral depravity of hollywood br br in this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included that both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship
<START> hello i just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days i am a history teacher that has wayyyyy too much time on my hands i need a life i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain i also found that i look a lot like jean lafitte if he were white also my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr petey this baby can shoot a chipmunk's eye from 300 yards oh and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work and he drummed till the death as if that drum would end the war altogether but it wouldn't well thats all i would like to say about this movie oh one more thing bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging beeyotch that is all
<START> its not the cast a finer group of actors you could not find its not the setting the director is in love with new york city and by the end of the film so are we all woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here if you are going to fall in love or find love manhattan is the place to go no the problem with the movie is the script there is none the actors fall in love at first sight words are unnecessary in the director's own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world so in the end the movie is hollow and shallow and message less
<START> if you can believe it another group of teens return to another lakeside cabin three years after another one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number low and behold a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask a cheap papery one at that turns up to waste them one by one this mechanical 'friday the 13th' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally shot features but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable amateur production with sub par performances and a recurring boom mic intrusion a last second twist does little to lift the spirits and 'memorial day' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about one for insane slasher collectors only
<START> this mini series also based on a book by alex haley as was queen' tried to use similar formulas that is constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years whereas in queen' the result was masterful here in mama flora the inspiration was lacking firstly perhaps in the book itself and most certainly in this tv production too much is put in with too much haste over the years such that the unfolding saga is shallow superficial not nearly so authentic as in queen' full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film which was prepared with great care but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration i had hoped for more but evidently haley was less inspired with this tale than his near biographical queen' and peter werner iii is no match for john erman only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up
<START> anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we're about to see can't ever be known and this is the whisper rumor most often told about one of hollywood's most sensational mysteries br br okay so we're not getting anything new and e 's mysteries scandals gives you a better foothold on the particular incident and that's not much of an endorsement what do we get br br we learn that hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents no big news there more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and or political establishment it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters but what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history br br the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun we're not empathetic with anyone and the great citizen kane polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way in the cat's meow we're not ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst as soon as we're told one thing she's off doing the other br br and are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplain's life or is he just trying to cockold one of america's most powerful and apparently moronic citizens the film never makes it clear br br what is convincing are the production values there's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well known personalities in hollywood history no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying br br the performers can't be faulted although meg tilly goes way past parody here kirsten dunst never disappoints she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing only joanna lumley rises above the material but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it one of her first lines is i'm not here and i'm sure she wishes she wasn't br br this isn't on par with bogdanovich's trashy so bad it's good at long last love it's perched on attempting something serious but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it's so full of bitterness towards the beast named hollywood this is national enquirer filmmaking and it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend but the audience gets pretty dirty as well
<START> one previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy i am wondering if s he saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since seven one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the clichÃ© of going to a b b for their first time of course before they do that one has to watch opium den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the girlfriend boyfriend at start who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now what did she do retire at age twenty
<START> i've always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david the monarch with a wandering eye br br a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film adultery redemption sin punishment and generally what god expects from his followers br br when you're a king even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us king david has many wives including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul david's predecessor but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening turns out she's as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women uriah is one of david's army captains david sends for bathsheba and him being the king she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too br br what happens an affair a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought disease and pestilence br br the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death david shows weakness in his previous actions but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film br br my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until they're both conquered br br susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle i liked kieron moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear br br no one can lay the law down like raymond massey his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films same intensity br br so when his own law called for death why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job he'd replaced saul with david already br br but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently i'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations br br watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory
<START> this was keaton's first feature and is in actuality three shorts set in different periods stone age roman age modern age on the eternal triangle of romance the stories parallel each other as in griffith's intolerance which this was intended to satirize the strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms bringing modern day business into ancient settings br br warning spoilers follow to elaborate best points br br here are the classic moments br br using a turtle as a wee gee board stone age a wrist watch containing a sun dial roman age a chariot with a spare wheel roman age using a helmet as a tire lock roman age early golf with clubs and rocks stone age dictating a will being carved into a rock stone age the changing weather forecaster roman age the chariot race in snow buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the chariot's boot roman age br br the above are all throw away gags that keep us chuckling there are however unforgettable moments as well br br buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl putting on make up the fantastic double take when an inebriated buster gazes at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and leaped again into the arms of the waiter one of the funniest moments i've ever seen and that lion the manicure just brilliant br br there's also an off color bit of racism when four african american litter bearers abandon their mistress for a roman crap game br br kino's print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage most probably at ends of reels the metro feature is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from grieg br br lots of fun and full of laughs
<START> definitely an odd debut for michael madsen madsen plays cecil moe an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him cecil grabs a phone book looks up the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night he goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems the preacher teaches cecil to respect the word of god and have jesus in his heart that makes everything all better ahh if only everything in life were that easy the fact that this film looks as if it was made with about 500 certainly doesn't help 1 10
<START> unlike endemol usa's two other current game shows deal or no deal and 1 vs 100 the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen br br dond and 1 vs 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace or end at any moment there is risk involved in every action the player takes the rewards are wildly variable and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money suspense is usually put to good use br br show me the money on the other hand is just too slow paced when a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first and then have the player select a dancer instead of shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they're right the random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler too much time is wasted while not enough is happening and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted br br oh and i have no interest in watching shat shake his groove thang especially right after i've eaten dinner br br i am a lifelong game show fan but even i had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this it either needs major changes or early retirement
<START> even if 99 99 of people that has seen this movie is brazilian i'll keep up with the english since it is the language of this website br br this movie is a piece of cr p worst acting i have seen for a loooong time the kids are terrible specially the boy this was the first time i saw someone with less facial expression than arnold schwarzenegger and one single voice tone like a 5 years old kid reading in front of the class how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better she is 3 yrs old it is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes br br there are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie 1 you are a pre teen 2 you have been so brainwashed by globo's stupidities that you think that anything that has the globo's seal is awesome 3 you have a serious brain damage br br avoid at all costs a shame to the brazilian movie scene
<START> this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured there's male full frontal nudity dead animal parts dogs licking nipples the female loosing control of her bladder all shot in a gray cold color effective but a little too much we then move on to seeing the btk killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy here we don't see fancy or good imagery it looks as if shot with your home camera it doesn't look horrifying but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling what this movie doesn't have is any drama really there are some cop scenes every once in a while but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer there isn't much of an arc to this story this could have been an effective psychological thriller a study of madness unfortunately the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage it's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away and that i have to reject i'm all for low budget horror movies but i don't tolerate animal suffering it was unnecessary excessive and comes without warning i'm glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore stay away from this garbage
<START> in my case i liked this movie because when i saw it i found more than i expected i mean this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after i finished it talks about death vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid point of the film that's what makes this movie so good the ability unique in don bluth director to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time that and the fact that it has so many good characters like charlie and ann marie that in the sad but happy ending you have to say i have something in my eye to hide the others that you cried all i've said are just only some of the good points of this movie as for the rest you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest don bluth thank you
