<START> i'm surprised no one has thought of doing a movie like this before horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme and nobody except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors likes going to the dentist tooth torture has been done before see the marathan man for example but this brings the terror into suburbia br br the plot revolves around a dentist dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen who descends into madness now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with but driven by jealousy and an obsessive compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him the doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas's character in falling down but with a horror edge br br written and directed by horror stalwarts stuart gordon and brian yuzna its witty and has a great flow also featured playing a cop is the ever welcome ken foree br br now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen having really only seen him in la law before i was blown away by his acting br br the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching but slightly under par compared to the original br br ttkk's bottomline a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe capped pun intended by a great performance from bernsen
<START> nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks but Â honestly Â why would we bother every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity every ingenious idea from george a romero's night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything on a secret army base at the phillipines scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport after a failing attempt to steal the virus the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's nightmare city truly bad but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations the undead birds were original for example and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick recommended to the fans don't mind the negative reviews
<START> in our household we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart our overall favorite is the 1951 black white classic because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest however this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely entertaining story quite faithful generally to dickens' novel see my comments on the other film adaptations if interested br br first of all george c scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad scrooge i adore his sideburns his long topcoat hat he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot and quite a handsome gentleman however sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought br br this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere hopeful and optimistic somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending filmed in the town of shrewsbury england it just seems somehow very british the film has a lovely musical score with wonderful lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper br br marley's anguished ghost with his wonderful jaw dropping scene and the three spirits are all quite convincing christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always however i found scrooge's nephew fred a wee bit quiet grim not nearly as jolly hearty as he should be i like the nephew's wife whom they've named janet with her lovely sprightly period hairstyle instead of blind man's bluff they've concocted a game called similes for the nephew's christmas dinner party which is a cute little touch scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing br br the cratchits and their somewhat meagre though much appreciated christmas dinner are well depicted with bob david warner suitably sympathetic and long suffering in his miles of scarf mrs cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york who also starred with george c scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre above all this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim not only an adorable endearing little waif but sickly with those dark circles under his eyes the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour br br this is a delightful heartwarming version of the holiday classic with its festive atmosphere it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season
<START> i'm a black man living in a predominantly black city that being said i have some major misgivings about tyler perry's work i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him because he's black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture but i honestly do believe that were perry white this film would have had the naacp al sharpton and jessie jackson all over his ass br br i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil the characters are poorly written and acted the jokes are so bad i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny i'm just going to break this big pile of sh t down br br madea suck the character may have had some appeal but it doesn't anymore when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless she is unnecessary br br the situation with the wife beating fiancÃ© was horsesh t if a woman was so scared to death of her husband why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work at any rate the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't br br then there are the two lovebirds a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds i couldn't believe it i really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more but what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch i don't use this term lightly but that woman only had two modes morose victim and psycho momma no matter which of these two faces she showed however there was one constant the bus driver wasn't going to get any he even married her without sampling the goods wtf br br then there's the family reunion scene here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos grinding for the sake of grinding shirtless overly musclebound b ball plus the great taste of maya angelou when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack all this crap is going on at the reunion in laughably easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell when they do everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too just like a pack of pavlov's doggies wtf br br then you have the final five minutes of the film in it we see the abusive fiancÃ© get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling wtf the only reason to watch it this far besides testing your threshold for pain is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well guess what it doesn't happen instead perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness wtf br br i'm pretty sure that if given a day i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks don't even get me started on the rest of tyler perry's films i'm just going to say this in my opinion as a black guy d w griffith's legacy lives on the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did selling us down the river i only wish perry's films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts thanks a lot dude what are you going to follow this up with in 2009 a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america
<START> this was such a waste of time danger if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave it thru the window br br an amateur production terrible repetitive vacuous dialog paper thin plot line wooden performances lucy lawless was pathetically hackneyed br br seriously flawed story completely unbelievable characters the two worst concepts in film and t v are 1 the evil twin 2 amnesia there are no twins br br the plot twist outrageously simplistic and obvious like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies it doesn't even resolve properly the evil is not punished for the original crime br br please please please don't watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue
<START> the first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism because this philosophy is a fake one there's a need to use scapegoats to assess the thought ettore scola's movie probably his masterpiece focuses on the outcasts the scapegoats of the regime br br of the historical event hitler and mussolini's alliance we will see almost nothing some military march some garlands some scattered voices our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility genius is essentially masculine this is the golden rule antonietta a never better sophia loren embroidered on her cushion antonietta whose world amounts to her kitchen whose pride is her offsprings at the beginning of the movie she's a victim of this hypermacho world but she does not realize it she thinks she should be happy gabriel on the contrary is politically aware he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country but as a gay man he is no longer part of it he's about to be arrested br br forgetting everything that comes between them they realize what they have in common and they make love this is an act of rebellion particularly for antonietta whose ethic should forbid such a thing becoming an adulteress in a land where politics and religion combine to repress women as ever leads her to some kind of political awareness one of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio br br expect the unexpected and maybe a doctrine which denies the human being his intimate personality will see that its days are numbered
<START> much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30 odd years later it's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote br br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73 year old solo act who can't get a job in a potato chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abc tv celebration of show business nostalgia br br nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter's be a clown then there's the film's present day setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound the periods collide in willy's glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of long dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartment br br willy clearly has been living there too long he's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils willy wakes up and picks up the phone br br hello who is this a pause never mind it's the tea br br old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands but simon's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willy's almost existential condition without turning you off at all 89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing' willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with baby br br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but it's matthau who brings this one home his make up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving ben's description crazy freakin' old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience his lines kill you too especially when he's trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea br br you're out of touch willy tells lewis at one point i'm still in demand i'm still hot br br if this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot lewis replies br br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and mid range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and ross's direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that end br br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
<START> wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood br br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs 45 secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then br br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes br br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money
<START> priyadarshan's hera pheri was a nice situational comedy this film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical br br in fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it isn't anything great br br the first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where akshay and john invite neha for a lunch and another when paresh enters br br the first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script br br the jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person's voices from inside the rooms br br the climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it's quite funny but the film ends abruptly br br direction is okay music is good br br akshay kumar excels in his part which is now become his second skin but this is his film completely and he overshadows everyone else br br john stumbles throughout and fails in comedy paresh rawal is hilarious rajpal is okay the girls are loud at times and awkward too nargis daisy and neetu only neetu is seen now are good in parts but shriek too often manoj joshi is okay
<START> this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name 'fraidy cat' fraidy cat's previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era's in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy br br i watched this movie almost every day as a child o
<START> i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be quirky and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh out loud humor in scene after scene there was a sophistication maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp i've rarely seen in an indie film and even more rarely in a comedy of special note here paget brewster's turn as amy the math teacher after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasn't been discovered by a larger audience she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience i look forward to more from the director and this cast
<START> whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i've ever seen i invariably reply black noon and to this day nobody's ever heard of it br br i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhs br br if anyone can trace a copy please let me know br br if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film
<START> europa' or as it is also known zentropa' is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes the picture was a contender for a 1991's golden palm in canners the award went to barton fink by coen brothers a film stylistically very similar to zentropa here's an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
<START> i studied charlotte bronte's novel in high school and it left me with a stunning impression here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england this young woman was jane eyre a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own her story which bronte told through jane's own eyes was both sad and inspiring br br as part of our study we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story and it blew me away the mini series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte's original text and the essence of the story but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great both zelah clarke jane eyre and timothy dalton jane's lover by the name of rochester captured brilliantly the essence of their characters i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion energy and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre but she captures jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly she holds in her emotions like the jane of the book at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane's passionate scenes the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester's devoted relationship as well the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story br br i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale if you have not read the book before then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story
<START> there have been countless talking animal films in the past the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting or are ridiculously amateur 'homeward bound the incredible journey' is neither br br this film doesn't need the infant pleasing addition of moving canine lips or gesturing feline limbs it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart as all great boy and and his dog films should br br homeward bound is the epitome of all family friendly animal romps to me and boasts some beautiful cinematography an inspiring soundtrack from the genius of bruce broughton and an impressive cast br br michael j fox chance br br sally field sassy br br don ameche shadow br br frank welker voice god various br br it is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'the incredible journey' which was made into a semi documentary film by disney long long ago in 1963 the sequel lost in san fransisco isn't nearly as good a film but extends the adventure of my favourite furry footed friends and is a fun urban twist on the grand outdoor adventure theme want to entertain your children with a witty pretty heart warming mini epic without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema parents buy all three films for your children now thank you disney for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early 90s classic
<START> it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left deathbed testimony which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying br br please understand while i admire ruth gordon's performance her character really really irritates me she is selfish and demanding she gets her own way by putting on a simpering 'little girl' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age worse she has now set herself up as judge jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband br br when columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off the cuff speech to an audience of high class ladies he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work br br nothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self respect not to do his job well here is one situation you can't squirm out of ms mitchell
<START> this one features all the bad effect of prior's cheap o movies but is so overtly racist nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature unless you plan to enlist in the marines skip this one oh and even if you do avoid it at all costs
<START> dick foran and peggy moran who were so good together in the mummy's hand return for this very minor universal horror offering but this time instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick babe we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named stuff but the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually nil br br dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as the phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself br br this phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness it's always nice to see perky moran but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal's instantly forgettable misfires
<START> tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting br br underground introduced the storymode which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard which is nice because now you can actually climb run and do all sorts of new things br br the levels are good neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs the first two games for the ps1 n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits in this version they shortened those features there isn't as many people wondering the streets in fact there are almost none in some levels and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot br br this game does have one con the storymode is a little short of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater so that is understandable however with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day br br overall a great addition that was very refreshing
<START> never realized that charles boyer luis denard appeared with lauren bacall rose cullen in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together even peter lorre contreras had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint this story deals with a republican courier luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations lauren bacall rose cullen comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life the real bad guy in this film is victor francen licata beast with five fingers who gives an outstanding performance great classic 1945 film without humphrey bogart
