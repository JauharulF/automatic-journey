<START> the story idea behind the lost missile isn't bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub par level br br the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth in a panic because it's about to strike the earth the soviets manage to deflect the object this isn't necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet in other words with each pass it makes a swath of death follows one that could potentially kill us all so it's up to the good scientists of the us led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia to formulate and plan to save us and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path unfortunately they aren't able to save ottawa i've never been there so i can't say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old american know how they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction br br so as you can see the story idea isn't bad and rather original but so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like all others see it at your own risk
<START> i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts all great but the french doors was amazing it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation the most spookiest thing happens br br eeeekkk i wanted to stop watching but i was glued br br the films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects it chills you right to the bone a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations br br the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time br br the french doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more br br loved it and well done and thanks for the ride these new zealanders are really turning out the talent br br a new fan
<START> this 2004 oscar nominee is a very short b w film in spanish a young woman goes into a cafÃ© gets a coffee and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments all the patrons are motionless like mannequins one guy however is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7 35 in the morning there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite well surprising the people the place everything looks quite ordinary and like the musical piece bolero the thing keeps building until the climax with its structure theme movement and wit it is an 8 minute masterpiece
<START> 5 minutes into this movie i was hyperventilating shaking and writhing in pain and not in the good way the story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea turns out psychos don't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he's at their door killing poor williams mom and dad well skip ahead 15 years and guess what still prank phone calling people yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no so after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life this piece of crap isn't even worth laughing at the shoddy production the acting or rutger haurs dwindling career i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i've ever seen just don't
<START> burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with dennehy although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horse lovers out there will love this movie br br
<START> lillian hellman's play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct refugees teaching the clueless head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little patronizing the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn't allow her much color their children all with divergent accents are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a wwii era man may be german that doesn't make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead it's rather dry eyed and inert from
<START> a stale misfits in the army saga which half heartedly attempts to be both surreal the foreign subtitles and vulgar the flatulence gags but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara bach the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste 1 2
<START> oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie's new wife and baby the problem is they don't exist ollie apparently made them up so it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family br br this isn't a particularly unique story idea as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the best of these was bobby vernon's don't kid me it is much better than one too many probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and strangle each other etc with little provocation sadly at the end of one too many that's exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas br br overall not exactly a milestone in entertainment there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself
<START> almost too well done john carpenter's vampires was entertaining a solid piece of popcorn entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects and obviously aiming on the from dusk till dawn audience vampires los muertos tries the same starting with a rock star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters but does that almost too well i haven't seen jon bon jovi in any other movie so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los muertos to his other roles but i was really suprised of his good performance after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing it' my life or something but kill vampires showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done this means a lot because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking just because he's a rockstar of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer machine of a vampire leader we met in part 1 or in similar way in ghosts of mars jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy moving as lithe as a cat attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin light almost transparent very erotic cloth and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made it really takes some beating but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's nosferatu you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the fun bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed make no mistake vampires los muertos is a fun bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins the bar massacre is what you expect from american popcorn entertainment the seducing zoey in the ruins scene is almost european like cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress but refuses answers at the same time because it would had slow down the action showed the audience a vampiress with a human past a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not and also is the from dusk till dawn audience really going to like this i'm not sure about that nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job vampires los muertos is surprisingly good but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative too expressive like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience in my opinion wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time vampires los muertos is almost too well done i give it 7 of 10
<START> oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself jeffrey jon heder is a 29 year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert jeff daniels who she may be getting married to br br it would have been an ok movie if heder didn't play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie br br keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don't look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort
<START> i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just dies br br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it br br some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence 3 the emperor now that's evil 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest 5 the last battle 6 the dark side seduction scene 7 the return of anakin to the good side of the force 8 and the last celebration br br some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary 9 out of 10
<START> this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen br br the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself br br ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better
<START> when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective br br when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original synchronized to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in mannheim germany the reaction of the turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish br br esthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness on first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very much br br the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity shown at once in the same characters at the same time
<START> robin williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill donald moffat is too one note as his father in law jeff bridges is excellent though as the quarterback and holly palance and pamela reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots it fills time nicely but is little more than that
<START> unfortunately spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out i'm glad they did i first watched spacecamp at a drive in movie which really enhanced the viewing a lot br br while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt i had never heard of the others in the movie so it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good of course kate capshaw was excellent too br br i especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for the actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us however this one was different br br all in all this is one of my most treasured films escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me after probably renting it for 30 40 times i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it now if it only comes out on dvd i will probably have it forever this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me
<START> with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars but produces and directs as well you know it's got to be good although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series i completely disagree in my opinion apart from the original dirty harry sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good in diry harry it's well do ya punk in magnum force a man's got to know his limitations and in this it's go ahead make my day also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series with great acting by clint eastwood and co star sandra locke and good directing by clint this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever
<START> being a fan of andy goldsworthy's art for a while now and owning some of his books i had some expectations of what i would see what i got was something completely satisfying and quite a bit more than i expected being an artist myself i work in clay finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered following him over the course of a year the director captures the spontaneous energy skill and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating if you are an artist in need of inspiration or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience then see this movie i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there creating dancing wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful
<START> i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
<START> this movie was absolute torture first of all it's a whopping 4 hours long true the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown so maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised sure didn't seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws the battle sequences were so poorly executed i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border each battle was the exact same as the previous it was so predictable this might be a spoiler the whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says no don't get a stretcher that will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies that exact same thing happens over and over and over again oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed the actresses had the most miniscule roles they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same two of them were weeping synchronized it was so comical they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together br br the list just goes on and on i know i'm still forgetting something anyways i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture
<START> i know that you've already entered this in film festivals or at least i think you have i may just be making that up but i think this should get best animated short film in every one bravo i can't wait for the full film i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations but hear it now and accept it as the truth kudos my friend okay now i'm just trying to get ten lines of text though i still mean it and here comes yet another shoe and i cannot stop here yet this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do in fact i'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic jason steele marathon i do have a lot of those br br r
