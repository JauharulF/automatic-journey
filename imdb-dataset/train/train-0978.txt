<START> early hollywood at it's best a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and admit it you do too

<START> i would just like to state that this may be biased as i am a producer on the film however i will maintain some sense of dignity br br the star of the film oscar ovies gives a stellar performance as jeff grinderlin a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy his mother played by christine haber is the constant support beam that without he would crumble upon himself his friends also lend a hand in jeff's life often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will which often times he neglects is there anyway br br the writing is superb and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie with half as much ben affleck boo hoo fests br br the camera work is a little shoddy at some points and the sound could also use a boost however the performances out shine the minor details it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer br br all in all this was a treat a rare gem among many jewels
<START> this movie is far better than the original the jerk i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python br br the card game with the hobos and then with mr suicide the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged while i like steve martin he seemed like he was trying to hard the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk
<START> this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark it's writing is lazy absurd self indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead br br it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing i've ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate i've ever seen it's absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement br br makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
<START> simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script crackle there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less quality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar moreso in the odd couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances i've ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simon's superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate must sees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history
<START> fascinating movie based on a true story about an australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused of killing her baby daughter she insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction based on barely any hard evidence i love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system i've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties it's not as has often been said a liberal movie but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge a cry in the dark is likewise clinical schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic some may find the film boring or dry but i found it engaging
<START> i don't know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this in fact it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way jafar panahi did br br the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time one connected to the other the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium br br it makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters and while watching the movie as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie it's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending you will want to find out the verdict you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls br br i like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee it's like venus vs mars it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like iran br br this is the second movie of jafar panahi that i have seen the first being crimson gold and am looking forward to watching some more br br am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a must see
<START> wow who ever said that edward d wood jr never influenced anybody this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point it makes the violent years look like casablanca santa claus also makes keith richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission i've had nightmares you know waking up and sweating bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being however i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well also if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa satan dichotomy on vhs tape look no further don't check out this movie as i've been notified the mst3k version is now available move over satan here's santa claus
<START> you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period br br this is a very chilling story even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind br br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it's this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it's scary too br br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end
<START> the american humane association which is the source of the familiar disclaimer no animals were harmed the registered trademark of the aha began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james 1939 needless to say the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me i suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making but i can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken
<START> the tenant is roman polanski's greatest film imo and i love chinatown but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy it's also a great black comedy some people i have shown this film to have been very disturbed by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way polanski does a great job acting the lead role in the tenant as well as directing it
<START> i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort true professionalism can't say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system appeared disinterested gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash
<START> waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting sci fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot technology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also dissatisfied me will smith didn't show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like i robot and men in black 2 4 10
<START> most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth it is worth paying attention to the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich all the gangster actors were cast it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way this is a film buff's film it was made by people for people who love the medium don't miss this one
<START> stargate sg 1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is teal'c a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team br br the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person's brain br br through the episodes we mostly get to see sg 1 the exploratory team comprised of jack daniel teal'c and sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth br br through the years you start to see a decline in the sg 1 team as close knit and more character building story lines this in turn means even more on world episodes which is perfectly understandable br br my rating 8 75 10 while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction
<START> one of the worst romantic comedies nay worst movies i've ever seen boy who works as a phone psychic must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams hilarity does not ensue boredom light gay bashing and horrible dialogue do if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue you'll like this movie br br be smart avoid this if you see it destroy the copy
<START> when a film has no fewer than five different titles it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad i saw the version on video called rosemary's disciples yes i am sure it differs from other versions but i am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have going to be really any better the story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists yep it gets bad this early the town is called lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in soon we find that everyone living in lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of mr cato the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back hence the name necromancy the people in the town do witch kind of stuff have ceremonies some like wearing a goat's head and promiscuity abounds not much really shown in this area but none of these people are very good actors mr cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger than life movie maverick orson welles welles is misused but make no mistake he is the best thing in this movie and that is really the saddest part of necromancy as welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance in one scene at a party director bert i gordon keeps going back to welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames it looked ridiculous as did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash it looked like the arm of a shop mannequin the story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed this also applies to the corny hokey ending the lead pamela franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent other than her performance real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans welles the direction and story were both done by gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine this is not a good movie in any way under any name
<START> edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least artful objects imaginable everyday items such as crates boxes metal containers etc items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by burtynsky's camera he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world for those perceptive enough to spot them that is even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky's lens but didn't we already know that from wall e he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures i e the workers in those places with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape br br manufactured landscapes a documentary about burtynsky's work has much of the feel of a koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns indeed director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china a dockyard in bangladesh and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china with their fluid camera work the filmmakers match point for point the beauty of burtynsky's images in fact the movie opens with a stunning eight minute long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color coordinated rows br br the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused contradictory and decidedly half baked at best but it is as a purely aesthetic experience highlighting image and form that manufactured landscapes resonates most in the case of burtynsky perhaps a picture really is worth a thousand words
<START> a masterful treatment of james caine's the postman always rings twice as luchino visconti's first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war torn italy the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo realist work today a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe 1941 star as the sensually charged and ill fated lovers who plot to kill her husband unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime excellent direction script acting and cinematography reportedly not as good as the french le dernier tournant' 1939 but probably better than the us version 1946 featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles highly recommended
