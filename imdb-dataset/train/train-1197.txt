<START> everyone in the cast from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone we know in everyday life they were so natural and sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable the score is so moving it brought me to tears the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic mai's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing the king and i aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right br br this film is truly a keeper
<START> this movie is ridiculous anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet lame i feel like all the other soaring comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers i was not very impressed by the storyline but just wanted to see some beautiful oregon countryside and there was some decent cinematography but the casting was anything but inspired i think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile and possible it places jokes in the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me think it was written by the state department or something back to the drawing board to even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like harold and maude is absolutely retarded and along the same line of begging and pretension and joking as is rampant in this film
<START> as you may or may not have heard there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either there was absolutely no story or plot just things happening the acting was incredibly bad worse than safeauto commercials bad br br not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer i'm not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects br br this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i've ever seen in my life the only circumstance that i wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's br br really though even with all of the criticism i offer here i'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever and because of this is quite comical even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained
<START> and rent a good horror movie it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichÃ©d and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like scream and scary movie br br in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid we're going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialog br br there really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really br br all the characters act in stupid ways including the police cover the place in teams of 2 front and back not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed br br the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims or doors nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door the people are like mentally disabled sheep br br by the by if you're a gore fan you'll be disappointed too all the killing is kept offscreen and is ahem tastefully done so boo hoo for you br br none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out br br the only clichÃ© missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer aiieeee br br and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die well let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice snore br br the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough don't encourage this kind of lazy film making br br oh and by the way no crowning of a prom king or queen no tiara no bucket of blood br br so save your money and rent carrie or friday the 13th or halloween or scream or scary movie any of them to get a good scare with some original twists
<START> gene tierney and dana andrews who were both so memorable in 1944's laura re teamed for this excellent 1950 film noir br br an embittered policeman andrews as mark can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail as a result of his bitterness mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands it's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small time hood craig stevens br br in trying to frame gangster gary merrill mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab drive tom tully who is the father of gene tierney who was separated by stevens br br this is a well thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human being br br the ending is not exactly upbeat as mark will have to face the music at least he finally admits to what he has done
<START> when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles this opinion however does not resemble neorealist movies in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the postman always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to entail below br br first visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna clara calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr giuseppe bragana juan de landa her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters we have to love each other affectionately answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything isn't it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that it's not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provoking br br second ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at gino giovanna's first meeting the first focus of camera is on giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look br br third ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona clara calamai who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance br br in sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely fellini's style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you don't have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of visconti's best 8 10
<START> what do you get when you mix a lump of clichÃ©s with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichÃ©s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget why you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made i'm referring of course to domino br br here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie br br ooh wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasn't been done a billion times before and much more skillfully than in this movie br br wow look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style it's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they're in and it's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating br br i've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before br br i've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before br br this one too br br uh didn't they reveal this 'plot twist' about half an hour ago was that supposed to be surprising br br if this movie is supposed to be showing a 'tough chick' going around kicking ass when why doesn't she do very much of it br br i can't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is br br how long is this thing i feel like i've been watching it for over four hours already br br i have no idea what just happened but also i don't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out br br is this over yet br br i want my money back br br the songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here br br it's ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one br br ugh br br and finally i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me br br in summation this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect avoid watching it at all costs if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn't flammable you should seriously consider being burned alive instead br br if i sound bitter it's because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and uh i didn't enjoy it very much
<START> not a woman film' but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy mckay simply doesn't know woman peaks of bad taste american pie's humor style crude story no sense groundless story refuted characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it
<START> what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this columbia picture it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show maltin's movie book does not contain it in nearly every department amazing mr williams is a jewel br br it's the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended as the wedding bells are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force there are a lot of laughs in the process br br melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious br br the film goes on a bit too long but who cares the screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best
<START> my husband and i went to see this movie being the horror movie buffs that we are two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back i was so disappointed the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances etc i found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us my advice if you are a fan of true horror movies save yourself the pain of sitting through this one i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either unless you have a free rental coming to you
<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england
<START> drawing restraint 9 is a kind of movie one either loves or hates fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with killing whales is bad propaganda aesthetically the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception i use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone probably it's just me but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived even when it's all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment br br in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of stretching only in my opinion drawing restraint 9 could've been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 1 4 hours yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15 minute gaps of nothingness without notice the movie has no standard scenario and there's no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary it's rather a kind of conceptual installation that's an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here otoh i also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes br br and yes the music score mostly resembled whale sounds how surprising br br 2 10
<START> i love tudor chirila and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i can't even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won't i'm not a movie critic i can't describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore
<START> i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and i'm still loving it now 5 years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out br br sure the movie is over the top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly over the top in a fun way without ever becoming truly ridicules it's a visually spectacular movie to watch it's a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie br br main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up which also received an academy award of course if you're a jim carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch br br the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps it's because i'm dutch and we don't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest br br the musical score by james horner is good and fun even though it's your average every day horner stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work br br perfect christmas entertainment br br 8 10
<START> i didn't like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie going tastes in the 80s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movie br br now stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad movie br br why is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie br br stripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis's lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie br br lastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murray's self centered smart alec man child character so if you don't find that character funny like i didn't you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny either br br stripes is very much a movie of its era it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early 80's buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fast paced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
<START> a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
<START> i really like slasher movies but this one is truly awful the acting is lame the script is bad and the atmosphere is non existent the plot is as follows a deformed gardener charlie puckett slaughters people in a small american town that's right this is the plot very original eh the night brings charlie isn't even gory enough if the film ain't gonna be scary at least they should make it bloody avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs if you want to see some good slasher flicks check out madman the burning the prowler just before dawn or humongous just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage
<START> at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it wasn't br br is a bad copy of the richard donner work lex is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin spice br br the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced br br the script is predictable and simple all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady br br the story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better br br i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy br br all read you later
<START> hg is normally exploitive and it's never really bothered me before i loved bloodfeast 2 but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch i'm not opposed to witches and i liked carrie the novel and the movie but this one bothered me i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99 of the time and then just snap nothing could be further from the truth i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology br br there were some decent concepts to the movie i liked the way the witch used men it was a nice change i liked how she could make herself attractive but didn't when she was around her forced lovers i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber this may have been a decent movie
<START> what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds br br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film br br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin' in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron's character br br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetary's meeting in the cafÃ© a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red Â a table cloth a bunch of roses Â until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tra la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated br br the achilles' heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin' in the rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin' in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
