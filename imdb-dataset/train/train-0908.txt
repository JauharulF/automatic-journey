<START> yes georgio is a light hearted and enjoyable movie comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music it's not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd although a full opera might be a better representation of pavarotti's operatic talents oftentimes an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person yes georgio permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not br br many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable i don't agree enormously talented people can be both self centered and charming charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other br br relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities the ending scenes from puccini's turandot alone are worth the time to get there
<START> this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults the idea of a child's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she's really exploring her subconscious just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep the bit that gives me goose pimples is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her the only thing i can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film it really isn't if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch paperhouse
<START> broadway and film actor turned director john cassavetes from rosemary's baby creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film it stars gena rowlands john cassavetes himself ben gazzara joan blondell paul stewart zohra lampert laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk the premise of the film an aging stage and film actress gena rowlands re evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph the movie has a slow pace and a dark moody frightening quality it has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanski's rosemary's baby without the supernatural horror the fears here are the ones every successful actress has she is getting old and she will become useless in her career furthermore she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality humanity and merit she has lived only for her career she has no children doesn't do charitable deeds etc the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film she is falling apart she's in a crisis gena rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well she is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers it's a movie with lots of deep seated emotion but has a cold cynical feeling as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects nixon's deception watergate vietnam etc although the production values are not great and this film is not well known it's a very haunting film with haunting moods kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late 80's
<START> the character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen unfortunately one of the better actresses jean simmons played many bit roles on tv like in star trek tng and in the heat of the night dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed br br the lead role is mr ballard as portrayed by cliff robertson cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time he doesn't do a poor job but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting robertson's most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last 3 spider man movies starring tobey maguire br br the plot is predictable a husband murders his rich wife for her money thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him on the day he is predicted to die no less br br the second chauffeur mr ballard hires looks a lot like an english mark hamill uncanny really the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue many minutes pass in quietness no one speaks and few act it is a shame the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie it could have been much better if not just as predictable with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothingness' br br i kept expecting g'mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the nothing that inhabits this film
<START> part of what was so great about the classic looney tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they weren't afraid to do anything that they wanted in this case marvin the martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling sure enough he comes across bugs bunny who warns of a mutiny on the part of marvin's dog after marvin finally traps bugs by means of an acme strait jacket ejecting bazooka bugs has more stuff planned for the voyage back to mars what i mean is if you thought that it was a major change in the solar system when they stripped pluto of its planet status then you ain't seen nothing yet yes the hasty hare goes all out how they buy acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people but the point here i mean hare is to have fun and believe me you definitely will after all a little space out never hurt anyone
<START> this movie should not classify as cinema although it is over 10 years old now it should never ever have gotten funding and is a blight on the australian film industry which is now producing such brilliant films as the dish br br the actors cannot act the music is to be blunt not music the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through br br do not watch this film it is a complete waste of your time
<START> the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the non directors cut br br the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there br br as a horror movie it doesn't work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented 15 minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part
<START> easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century in cold blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling and absolutely riveting br br robert blake walks away with the film the story seems to be presented almost entirely from perry's viewpoint despite dick being the leader and planner of the pair the viewer will invariable perceive dick as being more unstable immature and generally feel like perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score br br based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy in cold blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural kansas family one cold windy night because dick has bought into an age old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home as prosecutor a character that isn't given a name in the script played by will geer so astutely points out their lives are bought for only 10 a head director richard brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of dick and perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement but also perry's own ever escalating sense of impending doom he repeatedly makes remarks no one ever gets away with a thing like that and i can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime only irritation at perry's indeed after they are caught it is dick who breaks first and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime i felt somewhat sorry for perry from the very beginning of the film and more so as events progressed but i only loathed dick br br the genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played we do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred the story is unrelenting taunt the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes br br for those of you who are interested in such things i noticed a couple of the goofs listed here on the imdb page for in cold blood are incorrect or exaggerated such as the reversed process shot at the beginning of the film as dick and perry are driving across the bridge into kansas to begin with this isn't even a process shot the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real a large cargo truck located to the left front of dick's pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle br br as i previously stated this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to but a thoroughly excellent film
<START> just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water br br another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate br br b movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill genetic mistake monster movie costas mandylor evokes mick dundee aussie accent hat big ass knife the works as a croc specialist hired by gereco executive joanna pacula wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people charles napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane longenecker is his hot daughter who works at the animal shelter soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker's love interest a local artist who welds sculptures his brother is a victim of the croc of course this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide br br the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food the special effects of a low grade variety in regards to roger corman productions dealing with renegade dino monsters i stick with carnosaur the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs often upright as it pursues potential victims i felt mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen as expected pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion gulp
<START> every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them but for jake anthony de marco Â of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling who resembles henry thomas circa 1982 the combination may prove deadly br br a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter sean bridgers late of deadwood and jules brooke bloom cbs miami suddenly decide to divorce leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant Â a zombie in his closet br br jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon matthew josten who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re zombies jake is so convinced that one is out to get him Â and his family Â he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late br br indie newcomer shelli ryan Â who wrote and directed Â blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former smartly outweighs the latter with a decent story buoyed by fine acting de marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not 'acting' all his nuances are very evident of the awkward shy introverted child that many can relate too i certainly can bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality Â it doesn't help when dillon's mother ruth monette magrath who resembles laura dern is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is and more importantly how she has also affected her own child br br the fillmmaker's subjective camera is also well employed many angles shown form jake's pov at waist level or somewhat skewed i e the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard and the editing is relatively flawless br br ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears anger and stress onto their children here the film is very successful in getting its theme across br br however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan jake's mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy handed but again the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal
<START> this is an attempt by both author edgar rice burroughs and filmmakers at an arabian tarzan of the apes but this desert set film shows none of the majesty present in burroughs' more successful jungle adventure the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall as el 'lion chatham and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke as princess eulilah with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge the opening states that although guilty of conduct unbecoming the lad's mother is living but she never re enters the picture unfortunately the lion man has deteriorated and is looks like it's missing footage br br the lion man 1936 john p mccarthy jon hall kathleen burke ted adams
<START> whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies br br a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for you br br do not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on it doesn't
<START> what an incredible fall for sean ellis br br you gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectations br br it is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type br br 15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day br br a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring movie making imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions this is what it is br br decent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of time br br final words stay away
<START> umm i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks br br lets face it tori spelling is not a great actress and this movie just proves the extent of her talent the movie's plot was weak i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom if there is a good thing about this movie i would say it's that tommy chong's daughter just for the fact that she's his daughter and then there is that soap opera ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive but ceases to help his dramatic abilities why does imdb require at least 10 lines how many more ways can you simply say this movie sucks
<START> this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables the plot changes constantly one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90 000 dollars the dialogue is horrible br br please don't watch this movie
<START> there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don't 'get' it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross br br it has every a hem artistic clichÃ© in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense br br the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie 'ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers
<START> awwww yes it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abc sears and has their home renovated that's where the humanistic appeal ends i liked it early in its run but now this show has become disgustingly excessive br br ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on the people at habitat for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief for example is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or have his bed tricked out with low rider hydraulics does the mom really need her dilapidated non running and rusted out old pick up truck restored and pimped by some of the best customizers in california a new one would have done the job quite nicely and probably for a third of the price do people really need a sixty five inch plasma screen in every room of the house and then there's the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills even after the zaniacs at makeover leave somebody still has earn a living i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this largess br br this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for abc and a tacit commercial for its sponsors
<START> i'm 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter matthau this is the first time i've ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
<START> how can you resist watching a film with some swing it's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line too bad they don't tour out here i'd go see them see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music
<START> hobgoblins what a concept rick sloan was a master with this film he had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act on top of that he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong put it together you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners this movie was very painful the pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon and then having the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid
