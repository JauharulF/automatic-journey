<START> i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor mclaglen's performance in every sense of the word a tour de force the atmosphere of 1922 dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40's and early 50's very nice attention to detail also during frankie mcphillip's wallace ford's wake the mourners are all praying in gaelic max steiner's score is unforgettable as in later films such as 1939's gwtw he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time john ford already a film giant in 1935
<START> i had no real expectations going into this movie and i'm glad even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointed br br where to start first i think 15 of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field i get it there's scarecrows i think the title scarecrows was sufficient br br second not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences there's too many times where i was left going wtf br br third the movie takes itself seriously i'm all for a b movie with buckets of blood screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse but those movies often know they're b movies and even flaunt it like dead snow hilarious scandanavian zombie flick or evil dead 2 but this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom br br finally there should of been more blood and or nudity yea i said it if you're going to have a crap horror movie make with the killing and if you're going to have one hot and one semi hot girl one of them needs to show some side boob at a minimum br br so like the summary says skip scarecrows and just poke yourself in the eye you'll thank me
<START> the only part lacking in this movie is shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her aunt's footsteps as a daytime soap star otherwise it would be a perfect 10 br br it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script i have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you br br it's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once i'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose br br you'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely 'nurse nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you br br if you love daytime soaps or despise them this move pokes fun in all the right places
<START> i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5 2 10 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci concerning mr kamar del's reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of time and i'm trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o
<START> didn't know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling book tried guessing from the opening scenes what it would be about best guess buried treasure and a death list that lasted about 15 minutes when i got the sneaky suspicion that the film was crap i'll not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film makers i watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to rush to the hospital he had his on his suit shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a t shirt couldn't even get the continuity right i got the christian theme hard to miss it
<START> this man's navy is as other comments have indicated a rare and well filmed look at navy lighter than air lta activities the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about beery his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting drake's leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly ltas in action taking on a surfaced sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly gritty and realistic i imagine then we shift to southeast asia did the navy have ltas there never mind this part is really wild with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle and the japs are shooting like mad shades of vietnam except the getaway is oh so leisurely this is a blimp we're talking about in the end a feel good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war
<START> i haven't seen this don't plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless until poor little rich girl straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007 br br in fact i don't know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsay's recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she cleans up her act all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies br br up to this time movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to auditions actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in br br sooooo now lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wanted is she going to be able to handle this br br i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show br br all of the foregoing is merely my opinion i have no inside information
<START> if he wanted to be accurate he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free not sucker free i've lived in sf my entire life and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did everything was over dramatized and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his warriors jersey not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or 9ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made up sf or oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here hp has no bowling alleys black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china's olympic team nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops further while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission all that was shown was some white dude and a self proclaimed 100 west coast boriqua this is not new york puerto ricans here are few and far between and the latinos in the mission are very very different from the one that was shown here who was without a doubt from ny also hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs fillmore sunnydale lakeview etc br br this film could've been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with
<START> when the scientist and family man matt winslow robert urich finally accepts the invitation to work the micro digitech corporation in a space suit project he moves with his beloved wife patricia joanna cassidy and their son robbie barret oliver and daughter chrissy soleil moon frye to a huge modern house in the corporation compound they meet their friend tom peterson joe regalbuto and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro digitech but matt is not tempted with the offer later he is introduced to the director of the club jessica jones susan lucci that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club finding an evil secret about jessica and the members br br in the 80's when i saw invitation to hell i liked this movie that partially recalls the stepford wives with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound i have just seen it today and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story but i believe it fits perfectly my vote is seven br br title brazil convite para o inferno invitation to hell
<START> robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searchers or james stewart in the naked spur but as the film goes along gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him stewart granger is sandy mckenzie who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings debra paget as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time she lies with gilson in total resignation even though she hates him the last scene of a frozen gilson is unforgettable
<START> i loved the way earth is made its photography is unbelievable editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart's voice over is perfect in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you don't want to miss you really are on a journey to where you would probably never ever end up by yourself br br and although at first i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival i could not help laughing myself sometimes nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend br br but rather than the need to laugh i left the cinema with a profound question howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years br br with this question in mind you'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth i felt the immediate need to change the world to help all these animals in their struggle to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once all that not being a ngo activist at all br br so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our still fantastic planet and the polar bear from its depressing fate www loveearth com br br i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through br br i hope that cutting on my energy use will do i don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state br br an inspiring film it is but i didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy
<START> the fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in norway is bizarre this movie is just awful this image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary and the distributors did they even see it this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it
<START> i watched the first 15 minutes thinking it was a real documentary with an irritatingly overly dramatic on camera producer br br when i realized it was all staged i thought why would i want to waste my time watching this junk so i turned it off and came online to warn other people the characters don't act in a believable way too much immature emotion for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country he acted like a kid and i don't believe it was because his character was so upset about the trade center bombings br br very trite and stupid br br have you seen city of lost children french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams i liked it
<START> i watched this today partially attracted to the all star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk however this is one to avoid there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow the billiards challenge at the start for example the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh is that instantaneous death there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about 5kph are the highlight somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip its as if there was no time to get out of the way like when the obelisk in the city falls over the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left but no he screams and it falls on him i only give this a 2 because of ekland and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses
<START> stargate is the best show ever all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles i love the connection between the characters if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time which is highly depressing however this program is very very good and is a must see but be warned it is highly addictive so in summery i love stargate and amanda tapping
<START> blood of the sacred blood of the damned is the third installment of the gabriel knight games a series of adventure games about the roguish writer paranormal detective gabriel knight gabriel and his companion grace have been asked by prince james of albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so called night visitors when the son of prince james is kidnapped gabriel pursues the night visitors to rennes le chÃ¢teau where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the holy grail br br despite the marketing this game is not about vampires vampires have a token appearance in the game but never command center stage as did the voodoo hounfor in sins of the fathers or the werewolves in the beast within gabriel and grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or to research lore on vampires although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot br br a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight installments was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains through these relationships the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster however in blood of the sacred gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single cheesy interview which does nothing to endear the villain to the player br br the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly futile gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure hunter tour group staying at his hotel but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring grace spends her time researching the mystery of rennes le chÃ¢teau but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries br br the actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite the vampire leader are insupportable the ally leaves hints about the mystery of rennes le chÃ¢teau in broad daylight and expects grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them however he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours and in the end he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway br br meanwhile the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child the only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory br br the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail the kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted replaced with a race against the vatican to uncover the mystery of rennes le chÃ¢teau since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development br br all in all the game was a disappointing installment in the series despite an improved interface and the return of tim curry as the voice of gabriel knight
<START> i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn't been this is one god awful flick i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is indie films blow well this film does nothing to shed this curse the actor writer director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re hashes tired clichÃ©s from movies past i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it's way too overdone br br i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring br br the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back not that this concept bugs me but i didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it's inconceivable my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her br br the last point that i have is and i won't hold this against kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting br br lord help us all
<START> an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era i loved the visuals very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel br br i thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work which he didn't fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen don't want to spoil the plot but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action gangster format it is violent though
<START> oh my god i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious that is what it gets those three points for other than that it was atrocious it wasnt meant to be this funny that much is obvious but the dubbing the acting of the dubbed voices the dialogue they said where often hilarious the actions performed and or not performed also lead to much hilarity and or throwing things at the screen such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass or the attempted escapes from the church in which they hole up br br evil mayor i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window br br hero ok br br evil mayor now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and flail around with fire being totally ineffective and getting hacked up br br insert sequence in which this occurs br br evil mayor damn wait i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry pappa seemingly obvlious to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee insert sequence in which this occurs br br hero upstairs he is trying to escape again fool and he has left the door open he is silly this is a nice view br br woman where is my daughter br br hero downstairs now i dont know i cannot see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire neighbourhood and she is standing right outside where on earth could she be br br needless to say anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this so watch the first film with a couple of friends having a few drinks and make sure by the time you get to watching this one you are absolutely blindly drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all and there wasnt even any decent gore such a shame
<START> a call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here his camera swoops around corners in a museum after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals and stages his first finale during a thunderous rainstorm dressed to kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial much of the acting with the exception of young keith gordon is mediocre and the second finale is a rip off of de palma's own carrie not to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly half baked from
