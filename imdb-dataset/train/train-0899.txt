<START> this is easily a 9 michel serrault known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career does a stunning even worryingly stunning job of impersonating dr petiot a legendary french serial killer br br he is just so believable at every and any moment in the film that the actor completely disappears behind the character only the very best ever achieve this feat and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at best br br the whole story a real story which happened in 20th century france is so powerful so sinister it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long long time
<START> every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you're a part of this country i guess hundstage is such a movie br br you see the lowest level of austria's society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them 'normal' because they're doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria's art movies br br but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner queuing in the same line maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why you'll try to get away but you cannot maybe you'll end up like them but it seems 'normal' for you because you're doing it through your whole life now br br life isn't so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so far br br a very pessimistic movie
<START> my observations vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful exotic and fantastic jeanette wore it well and got even with naive nelson boat crashing into his balcony served him right costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well especially by today's standards 1942 costume designer did great job main song theme just lovely br br caution to negative posters 1942 was time of ww ii pearl harbor happened year before u s just coming out of great depression needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing dance and yes fantastic fantasy despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl snuffing out freedoms thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend movie going was a privileged treat in those depressing times when you negative posters become actors or even movie stars then you have room to talk and criticize jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time br br angel wings wonderful on the real angel rl wings at costume party not so hot but great on jeanette considering the sl br br beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson as always jeanette dancing was a pure delight br br 15 10
<START> i am not an artistically inclined individual i am a science minded woman and i felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget i watched part of it with my fiancÃ© and my future step daughter we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest my fiancÃ© and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to ocean's 13 but that is another story not to be deterred i awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot i began again watching this movie in earnest i just don't get it i thought i would get it i thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers interesting and still it had dead stuff inside it was an odd and bizarre movie maybe this is what they were after however i won't be tricked a second time
<START> i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store it was in almost mint condition and i'd never heard of it before clearly nobody else had either br br i can't believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message the very moral and non triumphalist stance of the mandela party undoubtedly despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two sittings it was like a book one couldn't put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing glows on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic i've seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book i'll treasure this little find until it wears out one day they'll make this again on a better budget br br
<START> i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie really unhappily i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it especially when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic i think that this is one of those movies every movie lover should have watched at least one time so that was why i watched it don't get me wrong i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion no really good plot neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story well not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'bogey' and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another i think to have and have not is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the 1940s
<START> this sure is one comedy i'm not likely to forget for a while br br wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is br br so what is it then well of course it's not really a comedy instead it's intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent br br of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned also even though i'm a big fan of the horror genre i'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting br br but still br br b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances if you can find the humour in that and i could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after that then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer oh that and two or three pairs of breasts br br woohoo how exciting br br as for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime the lesson watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done br br i rest my case br br so all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock 'n roll br br i rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if i could or perhaps i wouldn't it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles i mean that's something innit
<START> it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase bakshi's work is quite true to the original work the visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting br br drawbacks occasionally the movie is confusing or muddled there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl but overall buy this movie it's great for kids adults and collectors
<START> probably somebody heard of alberto tomba a former policeman a former sky champion and now a terrible actor alex l'ariete was planned to be a tv mini serial but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels now it's a believe me ridiculous movie the script it's simply hilarious it's supposed to be a dramatic movie something like a 5 years old kid work but what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting alberto tomba who actually was not believable as a policeman himself plays terribly a totally silly character a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open ariete is ram this super guy will try to save a young nice girl life an actual italian little tv showgirl married to the singer eros ramazzotti nice but absolutely inept in the acting lose this one and make yourself a favour a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry only john travolta in earth attack got close
<START> perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone for some folks the idea of slowing down reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell for others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists some part they long for contact with br br i suppose it's a function of where i am in my own life these days but i count myself in the camp of the latter group i found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological this is indeed a journey story a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days br br much as been written of mr farnsworth's presentation of alvin straight though i'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish i had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure i hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people not just for acting but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty br br given the realities of production economics i'm not sure full credit has been given mr lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly an outsider to film production i nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression time is money is so accurately descriptive going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed and to his credit mr lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality no simple task that br br if you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with the straight story and then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night
<START> having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs having others taste your food before you eat it facing an over bearing mother these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film there's also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing br br i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears prada and little else as she was in that film she is once again the standout here i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria and thought she handled the role very well she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role she's quite simply exquisite commanding your attention every second she's on screen she keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film br br rupert friend proves to also be well cast as victoria's love interest and eventual husband prince albert the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship they have their disagreements but you can tell that they are in love blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert the other actors in the film are also very good paul bettany as lord melbourne miranda richardson as the duchess of kent mark strong as sir john conroy and jim broadbent as king william there is not a single bad performance in this film the less focused upon people are well portrayed also given what little screen time they have even victoria's dog a cavalier king charles spaniel named dash is memorable and makes an impact in the film br br although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victoria's life especially at the end and instead tells us what happened with her and albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see this is after all a film about 'the young victoria' not 'the middle aged victoria' nor 'the old victoria' while there are some embellishments made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power br br the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it it's exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days this movie is actually a good length as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out br br it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt she's in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather important historic role this is one finely crafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a must see
<START> okay 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre br br mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films i've ever seen without the nasty edge of the exterminator other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia all the extras are filipino in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente' oh yes we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism
<START> i have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the u s government's yearly demand for taxes ever read a tax code it is quite a trial to follow it's multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups despite claims that it is fair the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential most of the various special clauses are meant for their use go through the average 1040 or 1040a form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules most people will never have any use for these br br the story here is that a wealthy landowner philip ober uses his influence to tip off the irs that his neighbors paul douglas and una merkle have not payed taxes in 20 years the baltimore office of the irs is under fred clarke and he is snapping to attention for ober with his influence he sends tony randall to check out the situation br br randall finds that douglas merkle and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people who rarely have need for cash they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors but randall trained in the clear to the irs lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals but gradually douglas notes that reynolds is fond of randall and he keeps sidetracking randall from his chore eventually getting him drunk he also makes it difficult for randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed for repairs by his two sons br br the plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban vaguely ambitious randall and countryside life loving reynolds they make a cute couple actually eventually after ober complains randall is sent back in disgrace and clarke a tougher cookie gets down to brass tacks and comes up with a very large tax bill that will possibly ruin douglas's family br br the film does not end there it does end happily but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the government does all too frequently go in for destruction a chance in a million reversal saves the family but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick more realistic is how clarke's boss charles lane cuts to the essence regarding ober's help by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully after that ober is rather green
<START> i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't this brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time i've never found margaret atwood's books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isn't easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious
<START> let me start by saying i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before however i am in the video biz myself and coming from that perceptive i can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short should be it has a very good story and another thing i love an even better twist ending opening was very well done i loved video chosen for it and how it was edited br br i am not a fan of b w but the way this film uses the effect it works and with any film that is all that matters the flow of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done from a technical side of things which is side i normally work on everything is also very well done there is no major tech stuff to point out only minor one i have is that the end credits are a little bouncy this is probably due to a rendering issue let me also say that i would have prefer to seen more of the love scene but i am guy so you can chalk that up to a guy factor br br so overall i rate it a 9 10 it is worth the watch if you fan of indies and or short films br br ps sorry for bad grammar or spelling
<START> one of the unsung gems of the 1980's scenes features razor sharp satire and outstanding performances from arnetia walker how did she not get a ton of roles after this and wallace shawn it's a delicious send up of class warfare and the people in those classes the writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced and sorry but the asian gangs if you can call one japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a gang were not put in for sociological value as another review implies they should been the value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it i found it creative funny and idiosyncratic
<START> this movie was made in 1948 but it still rings true today very very funny it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing great cast cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's clothing architecture and family life many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it a true classic

<START> yes i sat through the whole thing god knows why br br it was a long afternoon i had nothing to do it was bitterly cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones i have br br i gave the darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 i have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom poor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effects br br the storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family daddy mommy and little girl that i assume the viewer is supposed to be identifying with all three of them were tedious and annoying you just want the dark side to get every one of them br br daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious orient rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as the darkling br br during the course of the film the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy because trust me it doesn't really matter br br the darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion it gets a human companion and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being this of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who hooks up with the darkling br br and for the rest of us it just leads to a very long tedious movie br br
<START> wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'king of masks' for his mastery of sichuan change art liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang's mind the film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth br br i can't recommend this film enough the whole film is in loops everything has a significance its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes a total satisfaction for five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face last scene on the rope is phenomenal story and script is flawless actors are brilliant both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed very impressive it was not even nominated for oscars that year 'english patient' got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category 'kolya' won 'kolya' was just ok and about 'english patient' the lesser said the better watch it 9 10
