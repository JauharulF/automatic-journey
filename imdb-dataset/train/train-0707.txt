<START> the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter ashleigh richard burton and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton tatum o'neill and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society's standards the problem with circle of two however is that it fails to live up to its promise director jules dassin and hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay when i watched this film i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality instead i got boring dialogue a pointless lecture on art outings where sarah seemed to have more fun away from ashleigh and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost this script makes good actors look bad so one can imagine how the film's problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules dassin assembled tatum o'neill was not in her element i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with ashleigh her performance seemed superficial like a contestant at a beauty pageant it was as though she forced herself to be happy when the script required her to be happy and to be sad when the script asked her to be sad the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all that was probably the closest tatum's sarah norton ever came to being real but tatum was not the only one at fault richard burton's ashleigh lacked the charm the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age let alone a fifteen year old the rest of the cast was also dismal even their arguing was unconvincing because they waited to take turns who does that michael wincott as the jealous ex boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film but his role was small to be fair to the actors dassin's direction let everyone down but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script kubrick's lolita did that with james mason and sue lyon konchalovsky's runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing convicts the directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them in spite of its own score a combination of antonio vivaldi carl off and bernard hoffer circle of two never succeeds in doing that br br in conclusion the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one but its execution in circle of two is terrible in many ways it is a shame that a controversial lolita type story Â which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid Â did not have receive more intelligent treatment that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written that actors who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real could not be found and that the director jules dassin who did so much better with films like rififi and topkapi did not have to will to put his foot down and say before we do any filming we must rethink the love story and revamp the script the only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made if such a film ever appears this it will be surely spark controversy debate and questions for many years to come
<START> about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare we'd sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark s after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything we'd read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool it's the only other movie i've ever walked out on and i have no regrets i'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america
<START> in terms of the arts the 1970s were a very turbulent era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m a s h to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft literate arts films for the masses of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s br br but unlike the films of the 1930s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was precedent for this approach for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running george lucas's first film thx 1138 which dealt with consumerism group think and existentialism and logan's run which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation a few jarred strawberries cost 150 and soylent rations its assorted colored foods soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green reputedly made from 'the finest undersea growth ' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release and the scenes of crowding and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny the rest of the script by stanley r greenberg however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a dystopian flick but fleischer and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft dimly lit visuals murkily filtered add a stygian feel to the new york of the film almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer's vampyr the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless br br the end of the film where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers is both chilling and oddly drama less in the end the soylent minions hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to chief hatcher yet one does not know if it is enough for hatcher has already been co opted and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching
<START> mad dog time trigger happy whatever you wanna call it simply doesn't hit the mark maybe its just me maybe i just don't like gangster comedies as i thought oscar johney dangerously and mafia also sucked it's probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it or the other reviewers make it out to be br br the rick mick vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch br br there wasn't enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in the majority of the film was either set in dreyfus's club or a variety of offices dim rooms what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning br br the supporting cast was on paper excellent great to see silva drago but characters were killed off before they had time to develop and richard pryors cameo was a joke the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down br br 4 10 i don't think i'll return to it anytime soon
<START> how sheep like the movie going public so often proves to be as soon as a few critics say something new is good ie shake cam everyone jumps on the bandwagon as if they are devoid of independent thought this was not a good movie it was a dreadful movie 1 plot what plot bourne was chased from here to there from beginning to end that's the plot don't look for anything deeper than this 2 cinematography do me a favor any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job i am not exaggerating here this film is a tour de force of astonishingly amateurish camera work the ridiculous shaking of every i really do mean every scene will cause dizziness and nausea 3 believable oh yes definitely this is a masterpiece of credibility i loved scenes about bourne being chased by local police through the winding market streets of tangier i've been to tangier even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples 4 editing i don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some every scene is between 0 5 and 2 seconds i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the scenes flashing by 5 directing hmmm this is an interesting aspect the film appears to have actually not had any directing more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script all two pages at the cameramen and told to shoot a few scenes whilst drunk don't worry boys we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room the editor should be tarred feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor talk about stupid nincompoops whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper clip on the floor well all men are evil aren't they except for snags of course yes this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity 7 when the you know what finally hits the fan good triumphs over evil just like it always does eh and the would be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger yeah right at that very moment the evil deputy director just happens to turn up gun in hand and he does pull the trigger how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath wonders will never cease 8 don't worry there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts well we can't have nasty politically incorrect cia operatives going round shooting people can we how lovely to see a true to life p c film of the noughties the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish
<START> a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father ray milland br br syrupy sugary and most of all sappy story about a battle of the 'classes' when rich kid ryan o'neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout catholic father but no one in the film is more annoying than o'neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard's champion yuppie br br followed 8 years later by 'oliver's story'
<START> i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed there are not much movies i like but i do like this one you should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie i fancy to see this again action fused with a fantastic story very impressing i like modesty's character actually she's very mystic and mysterious i do like that the bad boy is pretty too well actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld' i considered about the vote of this movie i thought this is should be a very popular movie i guess wrong it was me who was very impressed about this movie and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one see and vote
<START> this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely mean spirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy that's a stretch and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasn't i'm a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was br br warning plot summary below rampant spoilers br br the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishy washy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck remember the movie's title so now he's dead two thirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant br br she's already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him she'll marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they not quite confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not it's that bad i left out the part about the cancer red herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment
<START> br br as usual i was really looking forward to a new tv film on a favourite subject of mine makes a nice change from a strangely familiar documentary about kursk or stalingrad on the history channel br br i avidly looked forward to pearl harbour and enemy at the gates but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent stupid ifying power of hollywood and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe br br so yet again i got excited about 'the rise of evil' especially as i heard that ian kershaw was involved as i've enjoyed his books i can see why he quit br br to quote some guy responsible for this rubbish br br the kershaw book was an academic piece he said it was br br quite dry we needed more incidents br br incidents are they totally nuts hitler's life cannot be said to be without 'incident' yes kershaw's two volume hitler biographies were long and detailed but they were supposed to be br br the thesis behind 'rise of evil' seems to be br br hitler was a very bad man no he was a very bad man who hated jews and just in case you miss this we're going to emphasise the fact in every scene in the film br br there was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did needless to say unlike the generally excellent 'nazis a warning from history' this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the munich communist rising were jewish and that this may have coloured his views on the subject and his axiomatic linking of the jews with bolshevism an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the nazi era br br but there was not much understanding to be done the film makers weren't going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway we certainly don't get the fascinating fact that kershaw alludes to which has hitler briefly being a socialist communist immediately after ww1 that would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless 'he was very bad' mantra which bangs away incessantly br br we know he was a bad man however we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations he could be polite and even sympathetic and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism anti alcohol and anti smoking that many guardian readers could agree with he was also famously fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dog flogging scene was so absurd br br he was also from all the accounts i've seen a brave soldier in ww1 whilst we saw him with his iron cross we never get to see how he won it acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say we also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst sassoon owen brook remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience and again like the point above re the jewish bolshevik link this is vital to anyone's understanding about the subject why did he love war so much why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary why didn't he care about his colleagues who died or maybe he did but still drew the wrong conclusions br br this film certainly didn't have anything of any interest to say on this either br br as all too often these days the film is a classic example of 'making history relevant to the present' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with 'the present' which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator where you don't trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing sadly correctly that you'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world br br history is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse this rubbish was a great opportunity lost again they spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didn't know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history br br wt
<START> i had tried to rent this on many occasions but was always with the girlfriend who as a general rule usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment uhm looks good but i'm not in the mood for that movie thus entereth the almighty solo movie night br br anyway i found welcome to collinwood a rather enjoyable movie while ultimately fairly forgettable it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments i was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway george clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that for the most part left me wondering two things 1 wouldn't every comedy be better if mr clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo and 2 how do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easily do they wash off the cast all fine actors in their own right put in a great job and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie both plot wise and humor wise but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original so i consider it a success rent this one for a good time maybe grab a few friends and a pizza you'll have a good time br br 7 10 br br on a side note the soundtrack is spectacular it's great to hear the far under appreciated paolo conte used and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled

<START> once upon a time there was a charming land called france people lived happily then the women were easy and the men indulged in their favorite pastime war the only recreation of kings which the people could enjoy the war in question was the seven year's war and when it was noticed that there were more corpses of soldiers than soldiers recruiters were sent out to replenish the ranks br br and so it was that fanfan gerard philipe caught tumbling a farmer's daughter in a pile of hay escapes marriage by enlisting in the regiment d'aquitane but only by first believing his future as foretold by a gypsy that he will win fame and fortune in his majesty's uniform and will marry the king's daughter alas adeline gina lollobrigida is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiment's recruiting sergeant br br when fanfan charges away from the recruits saber in hand to rescue a carriage under attack who should be inside but the marquise du pompadour and the king's daughter he now is convinced he will marry high despite the extremely low cut blouses adeline wears she in turn will soon discover her own love for fanfan we're in the middle of an irreverent movie of fanfan's destiny the ribald adventures of a sword fighting scamp and rogue there are escapes from hangings swordfights on tile roofs blundering battles romantic escapes and more joyous derring do than you can imagine what fanfan lacks in polish he makes up for in irreverence and enthusiasm he's a quick stepping swordsman and a fast talking lover but with such naÃ¯ve belief in his destiny and such an optimistic nature how can we not like him br br gerard philipe was an iconic stage and screen actor who francois truffaut disparaged constantly in the pages of cahiers du cinema he did most of his own stunts he was handsome athletic graceful and charismatic men admired him and women dreamed about him he was dead at 36 seven years after fanfan of liver cancer all of france mourned gina lollobrigida as adeline holds her own it's not those low cut blouses that do her acting she's sharp passionate not quite innocent and no one's fool br br fanfan la tulipe just sings along with endless satiric action pointed situations and good nature not to mention amusing acerbic dialogue after adeline has taken steps to save fanfan from hanging she meets the king in his private quarters give me your pretty little hand he says but my heart belongs to fanfan says adeline who asks for your heart says the king all i ask for is a little pleasure i'm a proper girl says adeline says the king you owe my esteem to your merits you love fanfan then thank me my whims enable you to show the greatest proof of your love by betraying for his sake the loyalty you have sworn him now this is clever funny stuff br br jean luc godard francois truffaut and the rest of the new wave gang tended to detest popular movies as mere entertainment and they personalized their attacks fanfan la tulipe and its director christian jacques were among their prime targets they probably missed the point of fanfan which is a very funny satire on the pointlessness of armies and war how much better it must have seemed to make movies of angst which only fellow cineastes could appreciate thank goodness some of them truffaut and chabrol for example outgrew this childish condescension and came to recognize that a good movie is a good movie whether the masses like it or just the cognoscenti a smart person who enjoys movies can appreciate any if the movies are well made those who condescend to a movie based on its degree of popularity are as self demeaning as those who brag they've never read harry potter br br jean luc godard eat your heart out viva fanfan

<START> if you don't mind having your emotions toyed with then you won't mind this movie on the other hand if you enjoy british crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end you'll be very disappointed br br here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment br br while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera this is a critical piece of the mystery it's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery br br the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues br br in england driving is on the left the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several meters away from the flower kiosk when it could have easily parked immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck did br br the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall br br search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting br br it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk br br it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators Âeven coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park br br the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow dimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the motherÂ but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self incriminate br br there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado's disappointment 'five days' is a very weak british crime story
<START> gayniggers from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name running only 27 minutes long it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women while i see a little significance to the plot it also is really illogical granted its meant to be a comedy spoof on society and science fiction i found myself laughing several times so it succeeds there br br the special effects are horrible when the spaceship is floating above the earth you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason the asteroids shown in the beginning look fake the equipment on the ship is illogical there are several misspellings in the text the actors are unconvincing the characters are messed up in general the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie its very accessible and easy to see through to the end some parts are hilarious but overall the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever br br seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects its not the worst thing to see but its illogical and holds little long term value i can't really recommend it if you do watch it do so for the unique concept not the quality
<START> you must be seeing my comments over many films under evren buyruk i am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though this film is basically two hours of dafoe's character drinking himself nearly literally to death the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of time br br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter stormare is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one it's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result
<START> bingo is the game bullshit is the name rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown up hodgepodge of half baked conspiracy theories puritan prudery and new age gibberish the bulk of the story is set at viciente a cristian resort in the peruvian jungle think tolkien's rivendell meets star trek's planet baku inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow minded cult of love and peace thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design the rainbow colored visualization of the mysterious all healing energy is particularly hideous the celestine prophecies looks and feels like a discarded 1980s twilight zone episode factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound i can't believe hector elizondo agreed to be a part of this maybe it was made without his consent bowfinger style may the lord have mercy on the director the screenwriter the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book
<START> well basically the movie blows it's blair witch meets sean penn's ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader no offense to 8th graders the two main actors over act the entire film they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film not that i know anything about those things but it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd i'd rather watch the blair witch viii than sit through that again
<START> the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist the lady barbara skelton gets raped and gunned down in the end and not a moment too soon i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason br br the original 1943 novel called the life and death of the wicked lady skelton i guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then was written by a woman an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both her heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty nothing else matters but other things do matter such as the fact that lady barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide she murders three men in five attempts a serial femme fatale she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate br br lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration era joan rivers or a restoration era joan rivers ha yet lady b is irresistible to all three principal male characters michael rennie james mason and griffith jones all of whom do good work as does patricia roc of course all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down accidentally in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death but hers is the first corpse we don't care about
<START> this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies and the '80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can't be all bad also fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack br br the original vhs this was pre dvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the 'ozzy gene' cover was only created for the 5 re release the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put 'em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star br br i have a trick or treat web site and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr' br br all in all it was just a good time rock n roll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed
