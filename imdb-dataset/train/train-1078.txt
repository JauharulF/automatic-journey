<START> rated nr would be rated r for pervasive strong language and crude sexual humor quebec rating 16 should be 13 canadian home video rating 18a br br eddie murphy delirious is eddie's first stand up comedy routine this came out in 1983 back then he starred in the movie 48 hrs and trading places and he was on saturday night live eddie made two stand up comedy films delirious and raw i preferred raw because i just found the subject matter to be more humorous delirious however is also very funny with eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as mr t and singers such as michael jackson any fan of stand up comedy films should see eddie murphy's delirious
<START> enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find out br br did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization particularly of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince albert's contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here br br the costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york i e did princess victoria really stuff an entire truffle rissole into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full br br 'could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached uninformed outside observer much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avant garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
<START> colleges high schools fraternities and sororities have been the most popular stalking grounds for maniacal madmen since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category from early entries like to all a good night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like urban legend or schools out there's usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline despite being picked up by troma the titans of b movie badness Â splatter university was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience even notorious hack and slash websites like hysteria lives have written off richard haines' splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom i always approach criticised movies optimistically because there's often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu which crowds the judgement of certain authors br br it begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges yep you guessed it Â an insane asylum it seems that one of the inmates has decided that he's unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore he's looking to take his business elsewhere the unseen nut job makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly doesn't shine he obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform blood stained trousers and all br br three years later we transfer to st trinians college an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests a teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden there's a knock at the door before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap this of course means that there's a vacancy at the university and so we're introduced to julie parker francine forbes the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer it seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughter thon before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade suspicious suspects abound but can professor parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic br br i'm not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available the uk altered video was released under the alias of campus killings but the us copy that i own states that it's the complete unedited edition which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere i'd be fairly surprised if that was the case as splatter university certainly isn't as gore delicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe one or two litres of corn syrup certainly don't stand up to gore hound's scrutiny when compared to the likes of blood rage or pieces so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped one thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from francine forbes who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79 minute running time despite amateurish direction from richard haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer unfortunately that possibility never came and bottom of the barrel bombs like death ring and splitz certainly didn't help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarship br br the rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of grease or the wanderers the bog standard point and shoot direction couldn't have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in haines' slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion let's just say that it's not a final that i was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle br br at one point in the runtime one of the teens says man that parker bores me to tearsÂ well the same can be said for splatter university which never lifts the pace above slow motion with that said though francine forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that i would have paid to watch again in a similar role so that pretty much sums up this un troma tising ride slow paced shoddy but still strangely alluring you'd have to be especially forgiving to give it a chanceÂ
<START> you think you've had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one
<START> okay who was it who gave revolver 10 out of 10 are you tripping of your head on ecstasy pipes there were so many of you did you do it for a dare is this some kind of cult or did guy richie himself sign up 788 times under different names br br before i say anything else i'll say this just because you don't understand a film doesn't mean that it's not great maybe you've had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then weren't in the mood maybe there's a more fundamental stumbling block like you just don't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it but and this is a very very big but the xxl elephant sized mega but to end all buts br br please don't confuse incoherence for complexity and please don't confuse this two hour non squirter for an interesting film really you may think you are pretty smart you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep like naysayers please don't you're embarrassing yourself br br revolver's a waste of everyone's time if you thought about if for a few minutes you'd recognise it too it was a waste of the cast a waste of the crew a waste of the caterers and definitely a waste of the precious minutes you can't get them back you know of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable wretched mess br br no wait comes a voice in the darkness you just don't understand its non linear that means the story doesn't go in a straight line this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur it addresses difficult existential questions and anyway they slated fight club when it first came out didn't you hear because they couldn't deal with the complexity they're eating humble pie now bet you hate lynch films too doncha br br hate to disappoint you but i am quite a big lynch fan i rather like memento so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesn't necessarily fill me with fear and although i've only studied it briefly a few years ago philosophy interests me greatly i don't dislike revolver for these reasons i dislike it because it purports to be about weighty big brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable i'm not much of a chess player but richie's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old i dislike it because the characters without exception totally alienated me aha cries the richie apologist guy is cleverly tipping his hat to brecht just maybe you're right i think its more likely that he just can't write a decent script for toffee br br comparing revolver with fight club is actually really instructive fight club has acid tongued nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one liners that make your ears bleed fight club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened revolver has as far as i can tell several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because well they don't make sense if you keep pulling the rug out from under people they eventually kick you out of their house and then they lock all the doors and windows and they never let you back in ever br br guy richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz phrases mostly they are spoken but often they flash up on the screen with attributions it's almost pathological br br but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichÃ©s in the world ultimately its so inconsequential you don't care about anything you don't understand anything you go home br br actually there was a bit i really liked the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence he's great but i can't recommend you see the film just to see him he's only in it for a few minutes br br please believe me it's horrible
<START> three girls the youngest descendents of the gaylord family one of america's most royal families are orphaned at a young age right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi their father tells the oldest fiona never to sell the land by the time the sisters have become adults they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property through certain loopholes in the father's will a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle barclay is actually based on john d rockefeller who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller center br br this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters fiona well played by barbara stanwyck although it's certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold domineering woman and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet susanna played by nancy coleman is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young coleman's was my favorite performance in the film evelyn played by geraldine fitzgerald is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england but that doesn't stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister the three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in the gay sisters never well enough charles barclay is played by george brent he isn't very good well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a scumbag in the film when we're asked to sympathize with him late in the film it's impossible gig young is played by huh gig young no he's not playing himself what happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name byron barr was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy i'm not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters weird eh young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience's sympathy for him in two other supporting roles helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite good br br the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas the characters are all interesting as are their situations unfortunately the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic it also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the gaylord family we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more and the ending needed some major fixing it basically just gives up at the end fiona's problems are solved so poorly that it hurts whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart it's also far too happy this story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss and we still hate barclay and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved as bad as fiona's story ends susanna's gig's and evelyn's is even worse br br i still liked the film it's thoroughly watchable even if it doesn't involve us like other great films of the era 7 10 mostly for its potential it should have been remade or the novel should have been re adapted at some point during the studio era it is too dated to be remade now the 1950s would have been the best time during the time of films like giant
<START> lady in cement pi spoof with ole blue eyes frank sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in miami in this rarely funny comedy burdened by an annoying and repetitious hugo montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this 1968 flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on tv made for television movie status dan blocker is effective in the mike mazurski ted de corsia big galoot role and raquel welch should thank her personal trainer the only thing that makes the dvd worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for welch flicks like bandolero fantastic voyage mother jugs speed and myra breckinridge even if you get the dvd skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features besides tons of mysoginistic asides sinatra lisps the homosexual owners of the local go go bar a relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule d
<START> this is best comedy i ever seen but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie overall one of best film i ever seen vachtangi benjamin and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili father germogel is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia sergo zakariadze sofiko chiaureli verikoan djafaridze sesilia takaishvili dodo abashidze they all are stars in georgian cinematography plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
<START> what is this crap my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title i decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality br br first the acting was terrible they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards the delivery is sub par and very formulaic scene cuts were terrible it looks like they took it straight from the story board if there was one br br secondly the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all again very formulaic i can't count the times i was able to predict the next joke i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly subtle sexual innuendos the cat the beaver patch hung wong c'mon just stay away from this movie it's not cute it's not funny it's not even stupid funny it's just stupid stupid it's like a pg kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo vulgarity and violence to bump the mpaa rating stay away br br would you like to ride my yacht br br is that what they're calling it now br br you could ride my ding br br oh i think i got blood on my stool br br badly played sir
<START> i think via satellite is one of the best new zealand made movies around i loved the way the movie delt with all the characters within the entire movie it was brilliant and a heartfelt movie br br a well made movie one which i will always remember and watch again
<START> i had the pleasure of screening the big bad swim at the 2006 new london film festival last week the festival highlights some of the best independent and non mainstream films from the past year it was my assumption that the big bad swim was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around eastern connecticut however as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well the big bad swim compared to the others featured during the festival by far it topped my list followed by the puffy chair who killed the electric car and transamerica br br the the big bad swim is an engaging truthful and often humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that i've not seen on screen in quite a while the interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which i found refreshing the plot doesn't beat you over the head with a direction rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on i was never bored i never cringed i never stepped out of the story on the screen br br the humor of the film is something like napoleon dynamite meets old school the acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived obviously not being a multi million production the camera shot weren't all awe inspiring and clear but adequate and well done for the budget the lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in closer i also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be br br i sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry but i have to say it if the big bad swim isn't picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed the big bad swim needs to be seen if you have the chance to see this film see it disappointment is impossible
<START> i watched 'speak easily' one night and thought it was o k but missing something maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldn't get durante's song out of my head i kept trying to better remember thelma todd's first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal a very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway buster in his blissful innocence botches every act again i was laughing out loud appreciating keaton's clowning and tumbling so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time it's stupendous it's sensational it's sublime three great comedians todd dances durante sings keaton speaks sure it ain't poifect but there's a lot of laughs in this picture
<START> i'm a big fan of 50s sci fi but this is not one of my favorites while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci fi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie it's clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever i have never seen so much time killing in a movie br br there are probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly written run on dialogue it was fun to see steve m and anita c together but good heavens how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers
<START> a truly unpleasant film while rick baker's special effects are quite impressive if stomach turning it has no other redeeming features like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense
<START> if the makers of atlantis had something to say in this film its theme was literally drowned out by the emphasis on special effects over characterization almost as if in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the summer action blockbusters disney has ditched the character driven movie with a message approach in favor of a star wars shoot 'em up with stereotype heroes and villains br br the art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images cgi of flying fish craft and submarines to fill the gap they are wrong and the days of beautiful handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly line cgi br br this movie is all spectacle with no heart at times the film comes close to being a good worthwhile movie but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz br br another problem with the movie is the pacing it starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated the viewer is rushed out of the door along with milo thatch voiced well by michael j fox and is left thinking gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to atlantis unfortunately not much happens the secret of atlantis remains a secret with the story tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island continent they are afraid to commit to saying where atlantis is even in a fictional story is it in the atlantic is it in the mediterranean sea who knows nothing is hypothesized even from a purely fantasy based point of view the viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves now what was that all about what was the point of the movie why couldn't the surviving atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the present day and why did atlantis sink and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw there is nothing left to think about or mill over except the loss of money in their wallets br br the characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable from the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 to the spoiler collective consciousness that enters kida and voluntarily deserts its people the crew are a collection of quirky 2 dimensional people of anachronistically for 1914 p c race and gender the demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a warner brothers' bugs bunny short most of the jokes are gross one liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons they are delivered at lightning speed pacing and usually mumbled the way these supporting players do a moral turn around near the end of the movie is hard to believe br br while we applaud disney for trying to create animated movies for adults and this is the first disney not to have cute talking animals or objects it fails to make the transition younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles when the characters speak atlantean in the first five minutes of the expedition approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought obviously disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were then why should you care again the movie has no feelings on any level br br mulan and tarzan were the last animated movies produced by disney that were done extremely well sadly atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the black cauldron and hunchback of notre dame disney needs to get back to their roots a sequel to peter pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself and now that disney has discovered science fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it we also hope that the upcoming treasure planet a sci fi adaptation of robert l stevenson's treasure island will have more heart to it than the unfathomable atlantis the lost empire
<START> what a fun movie experience i was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that i enjoyed it more than my teens take a tissue it's not sad just 'moving' in parts finally its a 'feel good' flick for the whole family note it's 2 hours so consider leaving the littlest 'squirmers' home for this one ap
<START> that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscar winning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx's performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe he's better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that i'm surprised his face didn't fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny it's funny if it's not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver it's important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether it's the right time for it or not i'm not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie's as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more low key approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly over the top as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless you're a die hard fan of foxx please don't take the bait
<START> does anything at all happen in this movie there are only the bizarre short scenes where i didn't know what the hell was going on so that doesn't count this movie is sooo boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies confused well i was after watching this crap what was donald sutherland on because he missed it with this one completely and what's with the pedofile scene at the beginning of the movie can put anyone to sleep 4 10
<START> i just saw this episode this evening on a recently added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekday br br as the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonetheless br br my father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago br br minor spoiler br br this particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period br br viewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4 5 decades ago and still provide some food for thought as did this episode br br while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20 some minutes of entertainment and interest
<START> personally i find the movie to be quite a good watch it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized br br not only that it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads br br overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens br br i'd recommend this movie to any triad mafia movie fan another good watch would be dragon squad that movie has more guns than this as in this movie there's more knives than guns in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun
