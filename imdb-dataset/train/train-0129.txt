<START> yet another son who won't grow up flick and just the other recent like entries heder in another bad wig channeling napoleon for what the third time anna faris is forgettable as always jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state at least and diane keaton how does one become typecast this late in a career do not bother nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over i will say this it's about a hundred times better than failure to launch there are very few amusing bits in the movie unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny ha ha he's old and he dropped the f bomb tee hee hee pitiful
<START> jim carrey rocks if he's in a movie its bound to be good he did not disappoint me with this one the rest of the cast was cute especially little cindy lou who and martha may i was laughing through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again
<START> imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain it's sold out options the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night you've seen the bank job suprisingly decent heist movie that and in bruges again pretty good so you're down to two you don't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the 8 50 walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for 8 50 it would be money better spent br br it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyone's intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden christansan i hate his acting so much i don't care how you spell his name you are relieved on your title s br br so in summary 'not good'
<START> i was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed the main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back why because of bad script although dillon lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie just like for admirers of beautiful diane lane legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him far below his level so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary the only thing that you'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes rest of it is very forgettable
<START> this movie was such a blast it has that feel good yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie it has a good message party girl decides she needs a real job yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor but is also a thinker
<START> the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands but she is speaking german to him the 2 languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes french commands and start talking spanish br br james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesn't fit him even if its mend to be a comedy br br to many stereotype predicable stuff typical comment or comebacks br br if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldn't suggesting renting it
<START> if you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the hollywood scene made it to where they are the vast majority will tell you assuming they will tell that a strange coincidence took place they happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects quinten tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew harvey keitel kevin spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role and robin williams credits his career to gary marshall's son who after having seen star wars suggested to his father that an alien should visit the cunninghams of happy days these coincidences many times viewed as pure luck shapes many of the careers in hollywood today or is it pure luck is possible something else is going on grand canyon written and directed by lawrence kasdan proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable aka the strange miraculous coincidence the movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstance br br kevin kline a middle aged father experiences a break down in one of the more dangerous areas of la after he phones a tow truck a young gang accosts him they threaten violence if he doesn't leave his car just before the confrontation can escalate danny glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang although glover denies it later he probably saved kline's life a producer steve martin of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience he then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment and kline's wife clair mary mcdonnell while on a morning jog finds a baby hidden in some foliage she claims the baby cried for her and that her rescue of the infant was preordained br br the movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships end to relationships and new beginnings and all the while a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on br br it is very rare in hollywood or for film in general to explore such a purely esoteric subject there are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable but maybe that's the point what makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast although the miracles and coincidences may seem far fetched the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities maybe this is a subject we should explore more often
<START> i started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago maybe 5 and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camera work make new york look spectacular br br the apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all time the amazing race is no 1 however but just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast the same case as with tar star world the broadcasters in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept fresh br br in conclusion you will love this show especially the first 2 seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast
<START> presenting lily mars mgm 1943 is a cute film but in my opinion it could have been better judy garland is great as always but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly br br i mean one minute he's ready to beat her butt but the next minute he falls in love with her i believe that this production the film editing and the script even though the photography was great the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well could have been a little better it feels as though the production was too rushed br br the supporting cast was good as well especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie she at the age of 11 looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's except for broadway musketeers 1938 she's really good in that when they tried to make her into a shirley temple sybil jason hybrid overall this film could better but in the end judy gave it her all
<START> excellent film suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout has not been shown on american tv for a decade one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack you will find others hope they soon put it on tape
<START> it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general however br br no spoilers only a brief introductory description br br buddy portrays four young people living in a flat share in oslo the protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the clichÃ© although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a 'young person' one can sort of identify with the characters crazy' situations and complicated love affairs i don't find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as friends' yes that show on tv br br has norwegian film finally found its identity audience pleasers in well known american style br br how about watching lukas moodysson's tillsammans together
<START> angels in the outfield was originally a 1951 movie from the ted turner library disney remade it in 1994 this time using the california angels now the los angeles angels as the team disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team also good use of the words huh br br this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family a man promised the boys a family only if the angels won the pennant so he called upon god one night about this the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and only that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball for much of the post all star season of 1994 the angels were at the top of the al west of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is however they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox angels game there was no central division in baseball back then hence chicago being in the west and no angels were there to help thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games but wait in the final championship game the angels won it was a miracle indeed br br what i liked about this film this is a good movie i mean i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now my work was good so for one this shows that if you believe god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life and second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting this is an old disney movie too i've seen this just recently on the new disney channel blech br br angels in the outfield will change your life forever once you've seen it br br 10 10
<START> the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production i've seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirs br br the first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good br br in the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second best of the film after the third br br the third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employer's strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father's views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11 year old chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must see for every true horror fan br br in the fourth segment horror actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistress co star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segment br br all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must see in short the house that dripped blood is an excellent horror omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended
<START> in a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as snakes on a plane and the da vinci code that's a pretty bold statement but i stand by it nonetheless superman returns like king kong 6 months before it is overlong hyper indulgent and with cgi up to the eyeballs my god this stuff is doing my head in br br richard donner had the idea of 'keep it real' for his 2 outings and i do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate brian singer bombards us with so much cgi that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend 250 million a totally irresponsible amount of money on obnoxious visual effects that don't live up to the hype we've seen everything and been everywhere that cgi can take us there's no real atmosphere or involvement in this and for a film that is 95 made up of this crap well you figure it out br br i've read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has 'soul' or 'a human heart' or 'tender character moments' puh lease we've already had brooding superheros silently screaming 'you'd love me if you knew who i am' dozens of times already in recent years and sr offers absolutely nothing new in this regard even the plot is recycled garbage lex luthor a seriously mis cast and hammy kevin spacey plotting to destroy the landmass of america was done in the first film already and well that's your lot it's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2 5 painful hours even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable but brandon routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat stand kate bosworth is completely unconvincing as a pulitzer prize winning journalist james marsden is 250 wooden as usual and kevin spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement the only cast member i liked was the lovely parker posey but i'm into weird looking girls br br every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic pretty soon we'll have 300 million films studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up for all the money that warner spent on this pile of crap for all the resources that this movie cost to make was it worth it in my opinion certainly not this garbage has put me of superman for life
<START> today i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids 6 8 years old payed 3 x 12 euros about 45 us total not to mention gas popcorn soda was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last 20 years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in heaven's name br br ps 1 the average working greek makes no more than 850 euros a month approxiamtely 1050 us br br ps 2 my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies in greek mora morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this 3d disgrace happen br br ps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a
<START> in 1933 dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes gold diggers of 1933 42nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players br br all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash both lack the infectious energy of cagney however who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend br br of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh hugh herbert guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size busby berkeley's dance numbers are surreal suggestive and risquÃ© and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in 34 sadly the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again gentility and morality made sure of it
<START> excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary finland touching and profound one of the best finnish films ever made captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town people's desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki
<START> oh dear good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but i'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good sorry
<START> well no not really its not really a good movie but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be i really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for the plot is ok nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty the directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem there was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasn't all that hot all in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film i've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan check it out sometime i'd even watch it again br br bonus fact for horror geeks kane hodder jason vorhees in a few of them plays the werewolf
<START> the infamous ed wood classic plan 9 from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race stupid stupid stupid stupid i'd have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie a ridiculously silly sci fi film br br falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie luke a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around so probably cursing under his breath the whole way he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks you'll find plenty of mindless violence but i'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing otherwise you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it's over br br luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth makes hal look like ghandi turns all the other universal soldiers into evil remorseless killers of course this is what these things are programmed to do but in this case they are killing their creators not the enemy so that's a problem br br i love the dumb logic of this movie logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue haired cyber stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time br br the film also features a daughter in peril character wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier and a romance so tacked on i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing and when this movie ends it ends not a minute after a gigantic towering finale style explosion are the credits running no epilogue no where are they now no final kiss just explosion hug over even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible br br while it's no plan 9 us tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths not to be seen on a serious stomach
