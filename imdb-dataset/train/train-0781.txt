<START> no i'm not joking around if you ever ever have the chance to see this movie see it if you need chop off your arm to see it see it it's worth it br br fatty drives the bus is unlike any film you've ever seen it takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art while it contains poor shots idiotic characters bad dialogue strange acting and cinematography that belongs on public access in iowa it actually succeeds in its goal as a film it strives to be the dumbest strangest most inane movie you've ever seen and boy does it ever succeed br br i will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things the filmmakers obviously didn't but really you needn't pay too much attention because the entire film's plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits in any event fdtb as its admirers call it is the story of a bus tour through chicago which is led by satan you see jesus is in town and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die and all their souls would have gone to hell except with jesus in town a lackey in hell calls off the job and this angers satan because well he doesn't like looking like a fool in front of the guy so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly but he's a devil so he needs to disguise himself otherwise who'd go on a tour with him right so he disguises himself as roger and he gets on the bus where the driver is never referred to by name but he is kind of fat so i guess he's fatty the bus and the riders are on a collision course with wackiness br br examples of some lunacy the title repeats on the screen 3 times i don't know why a character appears on the bus in mid trip without explanation or introduction and occassionally sits next to the others and they look at her like she doesn't belong i don't know why two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances that are really the same shots repeated over and over again i don't know why after satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes satan is going to transform i don't know why one character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag and is referred to by other characters as the glamorous bridget i don't know why br br if there was one good thing that came out of my internship at troma last summer it was getting my own copy of fatty drives the bus
<START> a really bad sequel part 1 had a lot of funny moments part 2 is just bad in a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans br br shame on you otto waalkes br br the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pis ed about the other characters it's quite easy to identify with him br br the screenplay is sloppy non existent the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play br br technically the movie is awful as well but who can blame the cinematographer sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director
<START> we had starz free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on it was this movie howling ii the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great sybil danning and marsha brown as the afore mentioned eye candy i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i saw br br my friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies if they saw this film they would know why i would get thrown out for laughing so hard br br just a couple of trivia notes reb brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie marsha brown was mick jaggers inspiration for the song brown sugar mick has great taste in women for sure
<START> i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august 1996 the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece it's the kind of film that people should be making i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around in this french film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men daniel's life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it's one of my favorite movies it's enough to bring a tear to your eye
<START> the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as esteban's sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non tropical latin american country settings of clara's home and esteban's ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere
<START> sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say gilligan's island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all
<START> guy kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs like most candidates he knows almost nothing warren william a very under rated actor is superb in giving instructions to kibbee that is he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public a campaign based on no comment i'll take it under advisement and maybe yes but then again maybe no is the nearly perfect way to win an election succinctly the dumber the candidate the greater the chance he or she will win after all the public can identify with such a person with respect to the movie it makes for a lot of comedy
<START> i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly recomend this film i wish it was available on dvd
<START> this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in school it is very complicated you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride hooray
<START> all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente run lola run franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentions br br plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy scary but plenty that are just plain dull br br all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour br br the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell who's done better than this Â that's even including erasmus microman
<START> for a lot of time i was looking forward to see this movie here in latinamerica japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters we can find some of those movies in some underground stores and i just found avalon i was expecting something good but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene the rest of the movie is boring and senseless just plain stupid with a lot of useless scenes and a boring story i am wasting my time even writing about this film sorry but is the truth
<START> some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school br br there are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for his her chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like you're at a picnic but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up br br all right i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places as i said the camera work is quite good br br but i feel cheated the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making br br that betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we don't like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just don't care br br i took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back br br now that really hurts
<START> this was great when i saw the japanese version first it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen it was not blood and guts it was eerie atmospheric and terrifying when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version i nearly had a heart attack i was concerned that the american version would be watered down and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version i needn't have been concerned the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand and gave the direction of the movie to the same man they also set it in japan in the same location in the same house in fact the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original the only difference was the casting of american actors that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of strangers in a strange land to the overall horror not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land having difficulty integrating into society it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch br br buffy actually does a very good job she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation in fact it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as horror 8 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards
<START> the film begins with promise but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation we are left hanging but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over it's a shame because the concept is not without merit br br we are left wondering why a loving couple a father and son no less should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining this loss of presence in the real world is rather too obviously and unnecessarily contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some colour we are left with a gnawing sense of loss but sadly no enlightenment which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all
<START> a badly acted two character comedy drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren't we awful to the indians polemic with lousy special effects exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence it's as sincere as a politician's handshake as obvious as a car salesman's pitch one of the worst movies in the history of the universe absolute and utter dreck
<START> let's be honest here the only reason anyone bought this the only reason anyone reviewed this and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch's children but guess what even david lynch can produce a piece of crap br br maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in itself as a pure subject of knowing maybe the atrocious cacophonist sounds and chicken scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity's place in the world about our relation to the real about the absurdity of it all br br instead it just says one thing to me i just lost 20 br br if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes br br there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland it is meta meta funny that is it is so bad that it isn't even funny because it's so bad this fact however is a little funny br br if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy dumbland if not spare yourself the agony
<START> a well made run of the mill movie with a tragic ending pluses the way the story moves begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there the music a disinterested look at the life of policemen minuses the violence and the gore but i guess they add to the realistic effects still having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided br br no complaints 7 10
<START> the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on unless you read the book which i had not br br if you can stick with the first half the second half is sweet predictable yes but sweet none the less br br the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80's not 2005 br br no stand out moments bland but it moved along without boring me br br i would like to know why keaton selected this role her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance
<START> the bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow haze of socio introspection emerged inspiring such famed derivatives as cop land the departed the godfather 3 and most recently of course the wire br br with multi faceted characters and story lines that have been described as '4 dimensional shakespeare' the bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go br br the show covered anticipated and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010 the most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 which aired on the eve of the second gulf war detective jim carver's misguided and ultimately career ending drugs raid on craig 'fun boy' richardson's flat in the jasmine allen estate in early 2003 was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of iraq several months later br br however it was the work the bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise this was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet phobia under uniform cross dressing in van homosexuality lost truncheons casual drunken bestiality regretted siren aversion syndrome sas groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many many more issues that still trouble disturb haunt and excite officers to this day br br the last word should go to one of the bill's most famous fans nelson mandela Âit is no exaggeration to say that i would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on robben island if it wasn't for the heart warming casual buffoonery of reg hollis
