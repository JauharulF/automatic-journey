<START> ok i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film let's name the problems first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion why is it that they can't get shetan's dam's name correct or her color in the black stallion returns we learn the sagr was the black's chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny wtf and it's set in africa in 1946 and 1947 i could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship wrecks time line doesn't sound quite right to me also as a goof there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetan's father upon further notice it appears to be a gelding ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way might be a cute family film to some but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year
<START> this is one of the best films ever made it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history the setting is 1906 wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation with this film you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago in a beautiful scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history this film is worth your time to see my only question is why aren't there more films like this one
<START> a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark infested waters as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters i thought this might be my kind of movie it wasn't this should be more of a guideline of how not to do it it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air it looks ridiculous good for a laugh though if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse i'd guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells totally i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast and somewhere towards the beginning there's some kind of meaningless makeout this is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me it's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish if you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
<START> in iran women are not permitted to attend men's sporting events apparently to protect them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans so since men can't restrain or behave themselves women are forced to suffer go figure offside tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who dressed like men attempt to sneak into the high stakes match between iran and bahrain that in 2005 qualified iran to go to the world cup the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game br br offside is a slice of life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films the shop on main street loves of a blonde closely watched trains etc that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the prague miracle in the mid 1960's as with many of those works offside is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative indeed it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective br br once their ruse is discovered the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside stuck where they are all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in guards who are basically bumbling good natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in still the prohibition persists yet how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction and yet the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a point they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and like all the men in the country cheer on their team br br it's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous but in either case the actors with their marvelously expressive faces do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing mohammad kheir abadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform as writer director jafar panahi and co writer shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others with this documentary type approach we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in real time very often it's quite easy for us to forget we're actually watching a movie br br it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good natured humor in the film it's what the czech filmmakers did as well the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign offside is obviously a cry for justice but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy breathing tragedy instead it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience's common humanity and isn't that what true art is supposed to be all about in its own quiet understated way offside is one of the great under appreciated gems of 2007
<START> after losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman a trail boss winds up in the yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup
<START> i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv i was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic br br the thing that mostly concerned me was the length i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end br br on the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard i also felt that gogool who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes br br i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9 still its a great film for the television 8 out of 10
<START> if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema if you've never seen a moving picture before you'll think this movie is a child of the gods but if you've seen a movie a tv show even barney the dinosaur then you won't be very impressed by this film heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick br br now i like b movies i just watched the giant gila monster right before i watched this swill and i liked that movie much better it works as a b movie it has lamer dialog hokier acting cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster carno 3 just doesn't pack much of a b movie punch it has some gore and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming almost flaccid it's the little engine that couldn't of dinosaur movies i'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie br br some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained if you're one of those people then give this movie a shot
<START> the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in 1990 the other being the more well known grifters after dark has all of thompson's hallmarks dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless br br jason patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring director james foley uses raging bull esquire sequences to flesh out the back story and the too little seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance but bruce dern is the film's secret weapon his sweet talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his scenes br br there's almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void
<START> just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid if your child likes this film you'd better have him her tested i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad this film is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else the writing is horrid i can't remember when i've heard such bad dialogue the songs are beyond wretched the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much who decided to employ joey fatone he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin br br the worst thing is the obviousness of it all it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible great children's movies are wicked smart and full of wit films like shrek and toy story in recent years willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past but in the continual dumbing down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo yes that's right the recent charlie the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood
<START> spoilers some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence but this contention ignores the actual content of the film oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination instead he lends them justification the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt engaging in vicious stereotyping stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures dumb rednecks broken english speaking immigrants lazy fat people the one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype of course they befriend the old hallucinogen using american indian because they're trendy dude let's make him an admirable character fat chinese clerks and hicks are uncool so let's make it seem like the deserve to die instead of twisted hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds their rampage makes them happier and more in love mickey and mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people justice is mocked the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal ugly and scowling compared to the gq murderers again this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film there is no nuance or subtlety in the film just overblown performances and visuals the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed the film's message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real life results the clever message is nowhere to be seen
<START> joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta joe don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to italy but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there joe don getting taken into custody various times joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don's character you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever
<START> after reading the previous comments i'm just glad that i wasn't the only person left confused especially by the last 20 minutes john carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him i anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior naturally i assumed he had something to do with the evil goings on at the house but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse hereafter referred to as zombie 1 these scenes made absolutely no sense please if someone out there knows why carradine kept climbing down into graves let the rest of us in on it br br all the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so i'll attempt a synopsis john carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate and is throttled by zombie 1 so far so good but then we get the confusing scene where john ireland and jerry strickler out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard discover carradine's dead body strickler repeatedly tries to push ireland into the open grave from whence zombie 1 had emerged but ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead and presto strickler comes out as zombie 2 yeah i guess we can infer that strickler was dead all along a witch but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting flesh version by flying into zombie 1's grave is never explained considering how excruciatingly slow moving these zombies are i'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his normal form until his business was concluded this scene also brings a question to mind just who the heck is zombie 1 we can only assume zombie 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits but who knows which one nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew br br anyway after ireland sees this transformation and runs away we see the exact same shot of zombie 2 shambling through the trees as we saw for zombie 1 this leads to momentary confusion over just how many zombies there really are then in best 1950's horror movie fashion ireland manages to trip while fleeing he conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of faith domergue's dead cat wasn't that nice of john carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew br br meanwhile zombie 1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house he easily dispatches three film crew members then starts up the stairs faith domergue hears him and thinking it's lover john ireland back from his night shoot goes out upon seeing it's only zombie 1 she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves ireland's revolver while starlet carole wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream her co star charles macauley who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom does taking his sweet time and only after some more swigs from his hip flask he finally decides to investigate one thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how slow to react the stars are to screams and gunshots domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready but mistakes macauley for zombie 1 and shoots him six times he does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing then a horrified domergue backs up right into the waiting arms of zombie 1 br br carole wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and domergue's screams she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate so during this time zombie 1 has time to string domergue up from the neck with a rope wells sees domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead away the next time we see her is in a stream outside the house but more on that later meantime ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers zombie 1's bloody carnage though ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined mercifully for him and the audience zombie 1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor that's the last we see of zombie 1 at this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths showing that the new ones mirror the old ones how profound br br zombie 2 meanwhile has gotten near the house remember these zombies move as slow as molasses in january where he happens to see carole wells floating by in a stream and fishes her out how did she get there did zombie 1 carry her down throw her in then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush john ireland apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub so wells has to drown too but why outside in a stream instead of in the tub is never explained zombie 2 never makes it into the house himself everyone's dead by now anyways thanks to zombie 1 but instead he carries carol wells back to the graveyard as the end credits flash on screen we see zombie 2 with his dead love still in his arms descending into the open grave br br the viewer is left wondering yes but wasn't this zombie 1's grave why is zombie 2 taking up residence and what if zombie 1 comes along and wants to climb back in is zombie 2 gonna let him or will there be a zombie fight will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased carole wells and what about now dead john carradine where's he gonna stay after all from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave if this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused don't worry cause you're not alone
<START> this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well
<START> i've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like mann's the insider is completely subjective it's from howard's pov so any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about nolte's character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then you're saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis br br but hey that's the nature of people br br andrew
<START> if you're a fan of the late gram parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock history's oddest tales br br spoilers br br basically the story concerns a well known roadie named phil kaufman played by johnny knoxville who supposedly made a pact with cult rock country folk music hero gram parsons that stated when one of them died first it didn't matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert joshua tree national park in california to be exact and set the body ablaze so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on sure to keep his word the barely sober kaufman with the assistance of a self hating pot headed buddy jacks the body of the late parsons whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior from the airport and shortly after that what ensues is a cringe worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late parsons girlfriend kaufman's girlfriend parsons stone faced father and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch parsons body br br the film's incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the titanic and not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place the accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as i've heard them include number 1 parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriend's and the chasing and whatnot number 2 kaufman's drugged out buddy was a known willing participant unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the disposing of parson's body and finally number 3 gram parsons real life father died when he was just a boy and so it was parson's step father who could have honestly cared less about gram parsons when he was still alive in real life that took care of the body after it was torched altogether though what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real phil kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story and yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind frankly br br also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it's lead character played by the ultra grating johnny knoxville phil kaufman is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical brain dead or seem utterly clueless as to what they're actually doing there in the first place overall if you like johnny knoxville and or really dig the so bad they're not even good buddy flicks then i suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie but if you're like me and are a fan of the late gram parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they're based on an actual real life story and or you just like good films be them road movies or fictional slice of life stuff you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise i obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made i would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of gram parsons life not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it but until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all around terrible memorial of sorts to the musical legacy that gram parsons was known to have left behind it should also be noted that they did actually use parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit turkey zero stars
<START> this could be a cute movie for kids my grandson watched it once he was watching it a second time i was watching some of it with him br br when the little bear gets lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says come back stupid ass fool br br i don't want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like this in it br br that is why its rated for children should be child friendly that is what i would expect put out by warner brothers and g rated i would expect this to not have cuss words in it the words don't even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later and the movie drags out in many parts
<START> for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing eva longoria who now stars on the tv show dragnet is sexier than ever the locations were ideal for the ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has it's share of problems such as continuity i must say that i would rent the director's next movie if your a film student you could learn a few things from the director's commentary
<START> i just finished watching this movie i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock horror films and spoofs i was very surprised at what i saw i knew it was low budget but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera it opens with a good song and a great very underrated band the horrorpops reforming their song where they wander and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways it's a great opening but the problem is the fact that up until the end this was really all that the movie was a live performance a death another live performance a death it gets old and there is a gross literally overuse of intestines in the death scenes why doesn't the killer use other body parts like legs or eyeballs or brains don't get me wrong this movie has some parts that are awesome like the hardcore french band known simply as beret the prospect of a band named atticus the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together since neither bands had enough members to play their show and bowling for soup's overweight and proud of it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner that i will save for the future watchers of this movie but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical but after a while terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the actors especially warped tour creator kevin lyman he tries very hard but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film but was contractually obligated or something in addition to that the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd the movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil bottom line this movie has a lot of good qualities but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror music or comedy film although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to otherwise such as tsunami bomb and the phenomonauts an insane psychobilly band i recommend that you rent this movie watch the first 10 or 20 minutes if you like it watch the next 20 or 30 if you still like it then watch on if not just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances they rock long live punk rock and horror
<START> i loved good times with the rest of many of you i love reading intelligent and insightful commentary the writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond talented to answer strawberry22 the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary what happened was that james was killed in an accident i believe i remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident and it was the saddest episode when it first aired and i was a tiny thing it was so sad to me br br florida and the children actually get out of the projects and even become neighbors with willona wilnona and that is how the very last show ended br br all of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams it was a wonderful ending and i cried because i was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that i actually believed in their fate i hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many br br a great show and many other great shows followed including benson and the jeffersons this was an awesome period for african american television and the best writers were awesome at that time tv land is awesome for the memories and i just love it because i cannot stand the junk that we are watching today somebody bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material br br love a tv land original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s as they sing in all in the family those were the days
<START> be warned neither zeta jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact minor br br the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancÃ© the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about 2 3 unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars br br 2 10
