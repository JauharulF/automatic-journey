<START> so i thought i'd throw in a few words about william mcnamara not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty whities it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them or less there's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies there's a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff with only his hands cupped over his groin william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side but he has a nice generous handful of a booty also there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada if you're inclined to do so and come on half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a road trip are i'd just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity can william mcnamara act heck if i know
<START> i first read the book when i was a young teenager then saw the film late one night about a year ago i checked it out on imdb and discovered no copies available i then hit the web and found a site that offers war films soooo glad that i did ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why i wanted to see it again br br in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film the book is no longer in print but i did track a copy down via e bay the author alan white was a commando paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book it is written by someone who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film not as good as the book there are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war the film illustrates this exceptionally well i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch in that order br br if you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and i only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see one of my all best war films ever
<START> i first saw breaking glass in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can't wait for it to be available on dvd
<START> i'm a big mark for the music of neil young and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt indie press circles hit the first showing of greendale i could find my excitement was short lived as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed br br neil says the film started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack not the best way to craft a story no character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer doesn't cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point the film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung the technique works for the first stanza it is done and is grating on the nerves after that it doesn't feel real or fake it just feels unwelcome br br terrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it poor lighting at times the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it an alright soundtrack but nothing i'm quick to buy a bad film
<START> working with one of the best shakespeare sources this film manages to be creditable to it's source whilst still appealing to a wider audience br br branagh steals the film from under fishburne's nose and there's a talented cast on good form
<START> i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it reminds me of the story of anne frank br br
<START> what's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie it's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens br br the violence and nudity might turn some people off but that along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i suppose br br my favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire alas your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say alas in a movie line unless they're english and living in the 18th century br br the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl rally isn't bad i also liked master little played by ron little wicked martial arts don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it
<START> when i first heard about this series on animetv i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen this one tops it all off i had to see this show and that is what i really did when i got the first volume of this show it was the best i really liked the animation and all the fight scenes were awesome i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber and archer and of course i also like illya and of course all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie famous for transformers and others playing the voice of berserker he does have a cool character and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume so if you to see something good then see this show it's the best
<START> much has been written about purple rain the apparent quin essential musician bio movie however i'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it's high praise br br first of all let's get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels even the score is mesmerising and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not and as such the movie has some problems br br first of all is the horrendous acting writing prince's character the kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments unfortunately prince's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it's hard to believe that he'd get the girl this way everything just seems a little off here which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live but we aren't ever allowed to get inside of it br br a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert prince and morris's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here which i guess makes sense from a business perspective but it's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it br br so to sum it up this isn't a very good movie
<START> sergio martino is a great director who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and as far as i am considered his gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire la coda dello scorpione aka the case of the scorpion's tale of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror's most original sub genre and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere style and suspense my personal favorite of the martino films i've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant your vice is a locked room and only i have the key of 1972 followed by torso 1973 and the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 all of which i personally like even more than this one that's purely a matter of personal taste however as la coda dello scorpione is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general br br the film which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man's wife soon after lynch begins to investigate a person is brutally killed which is just the beginning of a series of murders br br the case of the scorpion's tail excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant the plot is wonderfully convoluted and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end regular giallo leading man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead the includes the great luigi pistilli one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s and alberto de mendoza another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema athens where most of the film takes place is actually a great setting for a giallo the atmosphere is constantly gripping and the photography great and bruno nicolai's ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense long story short la coda dello scorpione is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must see for any lover of the sub genre stylish suspenseful and great in all regards
<START> yes keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film with a skip in his step in his tailored pin striped suits he'll remind you of jimmy cagney johnny keaton is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high priced medical bills to send his younger brother griffin dunne to law school no one even knows johnny kelly is johnny dangerously until later on in the film joe piscopo is vermin doesn't like johnny one bit i don't like vermin marilu henner has a nice singing dancing routine while johnny revels in it i love the part when they're in the ever changing getaway car the cop who's calling all cars is the skipper from gilligan's island see this one for 1930's gangster laughs the gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them look in the background of every scene
<START> this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not english but are an annex of the french province of burgundy br br the film features comic actor stanley holloway best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period br br the story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty the idea actually reminded me of the real life case of the hutt river province in western australia where a landowner seceded from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments br br this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the tv show yes minister as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well
<START> the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f murray abraham was in it spoilers about halfway through f murray gets zapped because the darkling is some kind of demon like creature who enjoys living vicariously he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins however part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness that's what the little guy said in his barry white voice which i found both charming and amusing mostly amusing like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen dee plane dee plane bos here eet come dee plane all through the movie dee dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice saying things like it's ok to be bad you know you want it now you've committed murder you're really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for being evil stores or something it really is hilarious in a sick way br br anyhow aiden gillen is no f murray abraham and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe or knifed f murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film he is a good actor aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical if this movie were a parody the ending was perfect if it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross out that the movie itself could not deliver the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending
<START> in what must be one of the most blood freezing movies ever a transvestite is murdering people in new york and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff michael caine plays a most thought provoking character while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo keith gordon who later starred in christine is probably the most interesting character in the movie but you can't really understand this movie without seeing it and after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust also starring nancy allen and dennis franz
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br long time inmate twitch kurupt gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re opened alcatraz he claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose there he crosses paths with burke bill goldberg a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself twitch despite being less muscular is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke but the sh t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics cortez robert madrid takes twitch's girlfriend and burke's daughter hostage br br steven seagal doesn't do sequels reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie so despite this being a dvd sequel the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end but there's a reason he hasn't done much work since universal soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor and not much of an action star either managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one liners support wise veterans from the first film kurupt and tony plana have merely jumped at the chance of extra work br br this is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well with the dim lighting dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it it does this quite well unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along
<START> oh my i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends wanting to watch one of those mild feel good christmas movies and i walk out disgusted the movie failed full stop paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine they try and turn a christmas movie into some new style sort of bad mixed with good but it all turned out very wrong the first ten or so minutes weren't too bad but once we saw santa it was over it didn't get any better the rate stayed the same there was no character development and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented don't watch it whatever you do
<START> i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one hour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director then when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag i attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better br br boy was i in for a shock at least season one had a few good stories here and there season 2 with the exception of the black cat starring the excellent jeffrey combs was a complete and total loss to me the episode sounds like may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years and most of the other episodes aren't much better i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year but i'm not holding my breath
<START> roman polanski has made many many movies that are unexceptional his fame bewilders me nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown i haven't seen 'knife in the water' or 'tess' any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago his work is just embarrassing safe and or dull the pianist frantic oliver twist the ninth gate pirates br br r's baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out it's lux produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie never show the baby but this is just misconceived horror sap everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early um thanks for that finale destroying title and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days it did not sustain my interest i find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was farrow is such a chronic distracted helpless waif housewife her frailty is oversold she's irritating in the extreme there's no real ideas in it nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil br br the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential
<START> starfucker which reads starstruck on my box was the most amazing movie i have ever seen i thought that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen so why not a 10 nothing is perfect jamie kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of hollywood i have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick
<START> i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured claudio cassinelli an actor i like i was certainly disappointed br br the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with rollerball logan's run blade runner and the new film death race which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason statham br br this was just a bore for the most part the kill bike action was ridiculous the training was a snooze fest it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including dallas star jared martin or fred williamson br br pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off
