<START> although kris kristofferson is good in this role who wouldn't want to see elvis pressly instead with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away elvis' agent to be apart of the movie it was a mistake this would have been a perfect movie for elvis even though the soundtrack is far from terrific paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this period piece musical somewhat of a love story this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption like is most tragedies the hero of the story was die also gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role
<START> william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it they move with their daughter sophie emma ridley and become friends of their neighbors jean patricia maynard and george evans brian croucher however eerie events happen in the house inclusive the death of sophie's cat in sophie's birthday party a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place disclosing a secret later br br the house that bled to death is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series hammer house of horror the fantastic twist disclosing a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent my vote is eight br br title brazil a casa que sangrou atÃ© morrer the house that bled to death
<START> valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii had concerning pacifists for lack of a better term the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspiring given the time although the revised edition through the transfer technology of early foreign films cuts off characters heads at times this film holds it's own in many different aspects character analysis lighting techniques historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker br br pabst went on to direct and put to screen weil brecht's three penny opera starring the original star lotte lenya
<START> yes i admit i cried during this movie it was so incredibly disappointing that i couldn't help myself but cry tbn trinity broadcasting network has done it again first with having the million dollar man ex professional wrestler on their program and now this br br the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies it was quite amusing yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate the movie follows what is known as the bible code rather than following actual biblical scripture this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie br br i highly recommend you do not watch this movie even if your life depended on it
<START> i grew up with h r pufnstuff and the dashingly talented jack wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of jack wild too this movie is exactly what movies should be fun and entertaining this movie is not limited to children either a lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully and as a jack wild fan i would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing knowing the hard life that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song if i could it makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that i am now passing on to my children let's all go to living island where there is friendship and fun and keep jack wild's memory alive by passing pufnstuff on to others
<START> kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on br br the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i don't think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well br br the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhem br br this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages
<START> i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed cotton club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature br br harmann ising cartoons tended to be more cutesy and more upscale after all we are talking about m g m than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disney's very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went technicolor br br disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example 1937's silly symphony woodland cafe but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place 50 years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even vilified by future viewers
<START> i gave this film 8 out of 10 reserving 10 for e g amadeus and 9 for slumdog millionaire most recently this film is close to slumdog but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully to understand it you really need to be one of balkan this is an amazing movie much better and more contemporary of his previous films which are boring at this time i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie i like humour balkan humour photography is an art itself each scene is artistic to the limit plot is probably a fairy tale don't recall it now but remember reading to my daughter going to sleep a similar story
<START> a young woman unwittingly becomes part of a kidnapping plot involving the son of a movie producer she is babysitting the kidnappers happen to be former business partners of the son's father and are looking to exact some revenge on him our babysitter must bide her time and wait to see what will become of the son and herself while the kidnappers begin to argue amongst themselves placing the kidnap victims in great peril according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br that acclaimed director renÃ© clÃ©ment could be responsible for this haphazard crime thriller is the real shocker despite beginning with the appearance of having been edited in a washing machine the film develops a linear storyline once you've figured out what is going on the engaging maria schneider as michelle and endearing john whittington as boots can get you through the film there are a couple of female nude scenes which fit into the storyline well br br wanted babysitter 10 15 75 renÃ© clÃ©ment maria schneider john whittington vic morrow
<START> there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset br br but it's basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost br br i had it as a xmas gift as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in a time to kill and the the newton boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work br br however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of view br br the films star though patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy he'd be well written into a rom com br br so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen i'd recommend a time to kill the newton boys frailty how to lose a guy in 10 days edtv and amistad and avoid too larger than life and angels in the outfield unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines br br as for scorpion springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either
<START> i'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lee's latest a wee bit boring although he was trying something different i e not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer i don't think it worked too well br br there's really a bit too much going on vinny john leguizamo and dionna's mira sorvino relationship ritchie's adrien brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is good but at the end thats all you have 2 or 3 stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film br br there are some good points though all scenes with the 'son of sam' killer david berkowitz look very nice colour saturation etc and the acting is pretty good throughout br br overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings it just wasn't strong enough in the end br br
<START> spoilers spoilers br br this movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine i've got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very sceptical br br upon viewing i was surprised br br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and it's all good br br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitles br br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research it's all good br br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war it's a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect it's a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i 52 it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck br br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i can't remember it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again it's all good br br plot wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and it's crew one of the visitors a man in his 50's has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever found br br what to expect br br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprise br br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem it's not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtle br br overall really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while yes a child's story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nice br br medusa 2001 br br
<START> this movie is one of the most awful i've ever seen not only is the dialogue awful it never ends you'll think it's ending but it's not how long is it 140 160 minutes i don't even know i do know that i'll never watch it again it's like someone took a romantic comedy took out the comedy then decided to downplay the romance leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen but don't take my word for it find out for yourself how terrible this film is
<START> it ran 8 seasons but it's first in early 1959 and it's last in the autumn of 1965 were shorter than seasons 2 7 cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in september 1965 because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor who had departed after season 7 the last new episode aired in november 1965 the lone 1966 cbs broadcast on january 4 1966 was a rerun br br i have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white gunsmoke was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on september 17 1966 for the episode snap decision
<START> this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen to begin i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown you are soooo wrong in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight i mean seriously wtf how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right wrong the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s i c k br br bottom line is don't see this film
<START> i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasn't sure that i was getting whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies i e sister act br br however this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking br br this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community i do think that it is worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you
<START> first thing i noticed in this movie of course was the unnecessary amount of nudity it's not oozing nudity or anything but a lot that was not needed annik borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf and believes their fate are destined to be the same which actually i found quite interesting the original wolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie but universal threw in the actual wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two i find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting unfortunately this is not the film i was searching for br br instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning so there's no thrill or twist also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario they fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality at first i was excited upon reading the description of the film but i slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible br br annik borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role since the character danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf it takes little skill to play she has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light the idea is great but hideously executed throughout the film 3 10
<START> i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but i can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a red blooded male to watch except for a single instance at the very end of the movie i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self indulgent melodrama ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie br br ann lord is elderly bed ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side discomfited by the memories of her past ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before harris while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her ill fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with br br both ann and her two daughters one married with children one a serial commitophobe struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters br br the cinematography for evening is interesting most of the film is spent in ann's mind as she recalls the past and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past claire danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just 5' 5 in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test br br you can't really talk trash about the cast which leads off with claire danes and doesn't let up from there vanessa redgrave patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film br br i can't really say anything negative about this film at all though hugh dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one dimensionality is in the end a total loss playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration he had his orders and stuck to them br br in the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick it'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all
<START> i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now i managed to get it on dvd for my 18th birthday and was over joyed because i had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger my favourite character is charlie because he learns to be a good dog the movie is filled with fun songs and music the animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect this movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadn't seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as i do although i still believe that i would still like it because i am really into animated movies
<START> ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul
