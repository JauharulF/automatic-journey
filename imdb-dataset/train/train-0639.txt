<START> i watched grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a public service announcement br br grendel is another version of beowulf the thousand year old anglo saxon epic poem the scifi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies and the previews promised an inauthentic low budget mini epic but this one refused to let me switch channels it was staggeringly overwhelmingly bad i watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from i reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what i was seeing the following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity you've been warned br br just to get it over with beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets trivial issue compared to what came after it also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next fit appearance and function were apparently irrelevant br br marina sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the ringling brothers barnum and bailey circus she managed to avoid a red rubber nose but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup br br ben cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king his character hrothgar must have become king of the danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet br br to facilitate the actors' return to their day jobs waiting tables none were required to change their hairstyles at all the variety of hair included cornrows sideburns buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog to prove it was a multi national cast all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose br br as is typical with this type of movie at least since mad max leather armor was a requirement in this case it was odd shaped ill fitting and brand new br br the female love interest ingrid played by alexis peters followed a long standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down br br the unintended focus of the movie was a repeating compound crossbow with exploding bolts it never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired it managed to shred the laws of physics the integrity of the original legend historical fact and plot suspense all by itself br br hrothgar's palace heorot rather than being a norse long hall apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with atlantis br br beowulf arrived at the danes' homeland in a two masted stern castled ship that originally was part of a set the other two being the santa maria and the pinta br br prince unferth observed beowulf's ship's approach using a telescope before you could recover from that astounding innovation you got to see the ship from his point of view judging from the angle the prince was in an aircraft of some sort br br fun fact 1 in bulgaria fire as from a fireplace creates light without heat this explains why you could see the actors' breath whether indoors or out br br fun fact 2 dark age dancing in denmark looks like slow dances i went to in the 8th grade br br fun fact 3 you too can make a catapult with a timed release air burst explosive but don't expect it to actually harm anything incidentally beowulf was apparently a veteran of world war ii yelling incoming to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief br br grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely cgi creation he couldn't leave footprints even in snow br br grendel's mom hag was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn't inherited her wings recessive gene i suppose by the way we can now make an educated guess that grendel's pop was probably swamp thing br br grendel and mom chose to randomly kill fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script br br fun medical fact being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don't bleed much br br the sword of legend beowulf used to dispatch the hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the golden gate bridge luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight br br best line of the movie prince unferth had just been impaled by hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet princess ingrid cradled him gently and said you're going to be okay my prince so much for that job at the triage clinic br br i feel better now
<START> i think this movie had to be fun to make it for us it was fun to watch it the actors look like they have a fun time my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more or more because we laugh together if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man he make us laugh together the most i would give this movie a high score if you ask me br br i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors but the main boy is cute the actor with the grand chest has to be not real they doesn't look to real
<START> first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help it's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast it's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie i want the 20 minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back
<START> this movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a mom lisa hartman black who acts like a man would in an action thriller unlike other movies where the focus is on the police here the mom is tracking down her ex husband who kidnapped their son she gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her br br before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen the mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local children's play at a community theater she gets caught and then realizes it is not her child that alone would have gotten most people put into the mental ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial however in this movie the mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her a little while later mom breaks into her mother in law's house and then the police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her and feel sorry for her br br at another point in the story they have found the child but when the police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the dad kept around just for such an emergency escape the mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time in a real world she and the lawyer boyfriend and the police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall instead of getting out of the raft to search for the dad on the land mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life jacket of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock the lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the dad at one point the mom is told her son died at a clinic in mexico on and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows in some ways this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive on the other hand seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun or funny
<START> the plot has already been described by other reviewers so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see gabrielle drake in all her undoubted glory br br miss drake has to be one of the sexiest prettiest examples of posh totty to have been committed to celluloid of her era and ilk only the equally exquisite jane asher comes close what was it about actresses with musical brothers nick drake and peter asher for those who like me have admired gabrielle her scenes in this movie will not disappoint she has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here br br as a whole the movie is very poor and being of its time very cheaply made the song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling
<START> reign over me titled after the who song is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye it was a moving story of a guy sandler that lost his family in the 9 11 world trade center attacks years later he runs into an old college roommate cheadle that he doesn't even recognize due to the post dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family the two rekindle their old friendship and cheadle's character johnson realizes that he must get sandler's character fineman some help before it's too late br br this was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time it's completely worth watching and after seeing it i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more
<START> this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour tim healy and jack ellis are spot on this cast is a theatre impresario's dream the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole non sexual love for poppy rÃ¼diger weigang as wonderful as always his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals outstanding rent it buy it love it
<START> a great movie lansbury and tomlinson are perfect the songs are wonderful the dances with a particular mention for the portobello ballet are gorgeous as for the animated section the match between animals has become an instant classic the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating i recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes if possible watch also the german videocassette it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders
<START> made in 1946 and released in 1948 the lady and shanghai was one of the big films made by welles after returning from relative exile for making citizen kane dark brooding and expressing some early cold war paranoia this film stands tall as a film noir crime film the cinematography of this film is filled with welles' characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting the use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in touch of evil and the mysterious chinese characters and the sequences in chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to roman polanski's chinatown unfortunately it is welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety the plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques br br however despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by welles hayworth and especially glenn anders laughter make this film a joy to watch orson welles pulls off not only the irish brogue but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions finally glenn anders strange and bizarre portrayal or elsa's husbands' law partner is nothing short of classic
<START> five year old michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father the highwayman who later commits suicide 20 years later grown mike gordon currie from puppet master 4 and 5 invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to master their own fears at a halloween night costume party morty a life size wooden doll kept in the attic by the indian handyman becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their phobias characters are thrown out a window drowned in a toilet eaten by rats blown up etc morty morphs into the dad and a tree walks around and makes stupid wisecracks after finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box the characters remain in the house act cheerful crack jokes and have sex br br the morty design is good and betsy palmer mrs voorhees from the original friday the 13th is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares bad acting brain dead characters repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera work plus the only two minority characters the indian and a half black girl are the first to die blah
<START> i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film if you sit close to the screen you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures the detail colors and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story how they were able to pull off the shading i will never know i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished based on this film i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film
<START> ok so it borrows a little from it's a wonderful life but that was 44 years prior to this film so why not a new attempt belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday he didn't get his wheaties his coffee and has lost his job the capper is when his self described big blue piece of sh car breaks down at the end of the day he heads into an empty bar to call for a tow while waiting he's recognized by the bartender caine as the kid who lost the town's championship baseball game 20 years earlier this gets him to thinking how life would've been if he had won the game he finds out when unbeknownst to him caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion the prom queen russo as his wife and makes him president of the sporting goods company he's been canned from caine later reveals himself as the one who's responsible for this change but belushi is not entirely on board he never fully adjusts and in a plot development that doesn't kill the movie but is still odd he tries to court his wife hamilton from his real life who is now married to someone else the good move is that they don't spend too much time on it as basically they rip of ghost with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know it also brings in a hokey dramatic element as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows new wife russo and his unbalanced lover cox but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning and cheery end also good work from the big and recognizable cast as belushi is very likable very attractive ladies chosen and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy strange that this was belushi's second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches which was found in taking care of business though similar both films are on the same level of laughs provided so check this out for a fun exploration of what if
<START> i understand what this movie was trying to portray how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty br br i do not have a problem with this message but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self consciously arty as in this case the result is often frustrating including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience br br the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its' merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies for example 'notting hill' but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching
<START> for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from hitchcock's the lady vanishes this movie requires an adjustment here she's anything but kindly or batty instead her son george macready is the loony one just don't give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mother's domineering hand br br really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never strays from foch's dilemma she's held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea they're going to kill her but why her predicament makes no sense the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her br br director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless it's a good nerve wracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios
<START> this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing quincy jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows this is truly a film to cry and die for the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself whoppi goldberg margaret avery oprah winfrey oh lord danny glover and the others all give us their best and you can feel it almost touch it goldberg is celie she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery even when she's at her most arrogant and shows us that sinners indeed have souls too the always sympathetic charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of i'd say sir quincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film the photography the music the director and the music makes this beautiful soulful movie into an experience of life you don't want to miss it sista' remember my name
<START> really excellent movie one of the best i've seen touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful not too much of anything just as it's suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of society's pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you don't have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it's hard there lies the true happiness br br great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie br br nice nice nice br br i recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians' life
<START> i can't say much about this film i think it speaks for itself as do the current ratings on here i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it i even tried to like it by watching it twice but i just couldn't i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again and i'm not one to trash a movie but i truly believe this was awful it wasn't even funny in the slightest the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me all i can think of when i see one of their films now a days is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money amy poehler is so very annoying too br br overall well i think you get my point the stars are for walken by the way
<START> i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina ricci has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film
<START> soulless milking of cash cow franchise generic superhero flick cgi showcase gavin hood's a series of improbable events combinatoric iteration of mutant fight scenes strung together by inane exposition justifying formation dissolution of arbitrary alliances i'm not expecting shakespeare here but the clichÃ© per minute meter was off the charts primal scream while looking skyward and kneeling over murdered girlfriend renegade military commander predictable double crosses revenge sought for slain lover erased memories evil character discovering morality at last minute misguided failures to execute nemeses after defeating them in melee lover not really dead lover actually acting as spy for hero's arch nemesis girlfriend spy actually falls for protagonist good people work for antagonist in order to save kidnapped family members evil mastermind fails to honor promises to reluctant employees kindly old couple care for weary hero and get murdered for their troubles certain deaths averted as third parties arrive on scene before coup de grace hero reluctantly joining secret government agency abandonment of elite squad in protest over slaughter of innocents scientists unable to control indestructible killing machine of their own creation outdated but lovable government 'secret weapon' kills off better designed but heartless successor hero strolls away from wreck and casually lights a trail of gasoline behind him after everyone has given up flatlined heart monitor picks up a pulse evil mastermind explains plans to hero he no longer sees as a threat hero refuses to kill defeated foe because he's better than that transparent comic relief character makes hilarious understatements and offbeat comments cheerful psychopath revels in random murderous rampages nigh indestructible goliaths hurl one another through a series of walls and other physical traumas that would kill a mere mortal man dispatches dozens of gun wielding enemies with nothing but skillful swordplay common sense and the laws of physics biology and chemistry temporarily abandoned antagonist using loved one's murder as justification for misguided crusade br br i could go on but this is just exhausting if you're over the age of twelve and not living in mom's basement there's probably nothing here for you depressingly enough it's not too far off of par for superhero movies so discount all i've written if you can't get enough of the genre
<START> well i don't know what people saw in this movie i don't know br br i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie br br the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age br br i didn't like the movie at all i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as br br i like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by ab my word dont watch br br save your self donot watch this movie br br save time and money
