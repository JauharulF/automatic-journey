<START> this film is quite boring there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed br br the best thing about the movie is lena olin she does a masterful job handling her character but day lewis garbles most of his lines br br kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this the incongruities in bouncing between domestic household marriage issues and political crises are badly matched character attitudes change without explanation throughout badly disjointed
<START> margaritas and cock br br this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments i had more fun watching the matador than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnan br br julian noble brosnan is a facilitator hit man who specializes in high end corporate gigs assassinating rich dudes he is also experiencing something akin to a mid life crisis after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright kinnear br br danny is a down on his luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him he loves his wife dearly especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier br br the two men are chalk and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever br br the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear br br but make no mistake this is brosnan's film he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date i wouldn't be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role br br consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line all blushy blushy no sucky fucky he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it he manages to tell a young boy tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years then get back to me without coming across as unlikable in fact it makes us like him even more br br and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns however when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday or when danny and his wife davis console each other in their bedroom one night the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion br br the matador is stylish and energetic it is constantly entertaining and it contains a career defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit man looking for normalcy friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible br br tc candler of independentcritics com
<START> i was excited to view a cataluÃ±aÂ´s film in the berlinÂ´s competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in uncountable films and plays as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism but what mr villaronga try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the filmÂ´s history it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film
<START> i must agree with the very first comment this movie sucks very very hard despite having a very big b list cast the cover of this film for those who aren't watching it on comedy central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get tries to put the blame on dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has been comedian from the '80s randy quaid check ed begley jr check the voice of lisa simpson she can now say that maximum overdrive wasn't her only horrible flick double check and so many many others br br the saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already told jokes nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny you're better off watching paint dry this is definitely direct to video scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage throw an old time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental considering the days of video rental are changing consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage br br the only use this movie has if you're having trouble falling asleep it'll get you there
<START> probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well br br doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers 1939 one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made br br a true compelling classic
<START> yeah right sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983's zu warrios from the magic mountain now 2001 he does it again with zu warriors but this time he finally does it right you seldom see him in wuxia more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick but this role simply does fit him the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies as far as i know about movies translated for the west although the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities straight said you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie and that makes it so great and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep right into the heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did ok true i didn't understand all of it the first time but that makes it only better you know you didn't understand all of it because there is so much spice in it therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again and yeah it grows deeper in your heart the more often you watch it br br summary a story to love characters you cry with and truly a movie you never forget editors note well i think i must watch it right now again d
<START> moonstruck is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller norman jewison in the heat of the night fiddler on the roof the hurricane the film is great on many levels it shows a good slice of italian culture has a touching romance and best of all is a hilarious comedy br br one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film and cher well cher always looks a little odd br br overall it's a fun film and easy to recommend br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex wife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects
<START> from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power and he is struggling to both fill his father's shoes and cut the apron strings mother and co executive keeps too tight he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later such as his friendship with his surgeon terrence howard and his romance with a middle class girl jessica alba uncreative story lines but not bad enough to ruin the movie the only real oy vey moment was the name of lena olin's character overbearing woman named lilith subtle br br the surgical scenes are not at all censored i appreciated that people who find surgery scenes scary might not the horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him br br the big twist however is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he like us initially missed br br there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother one is an impressive gesture by olin which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing the other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless br br the initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat taking the entire movie with it
<START> in the film brokedown palace directed by jonathan kaplan two best friends alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii but hear that bangkok thailand is much more fun they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans while they were in thailand alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks daniel lapaine he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison br br i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made br br this movie has a great setting it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand this film also has great music a few of my favorite songs are 'silence' by delerium 'damaged' by plumb 'deliver me' by sarah bightman and 'party's just begun' by nelly furtado i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience it makes no difference young or old we all are human and subject to mistakes even though i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of who really smuggled the drugs i would definitely give this film two thumbs up
<START> good story good script good casting good acting good directing good art direction good photography good sound good editing good everything put it all together and you end up with good entertainment br br the shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days we may count ourselves lucky that writers directors like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard br br whenever i notice that i'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right
<START> the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic one liners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat freak felix ungar and funny obnoxious slob oscar madison this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitations br br the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches what's the brown it's either very new cheese or very old meat i also love the line about oscar's refrigerator it's been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle there is no question that walter matthau's oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen he's almost as good as jack klugman's version in the tv series br br the problem with the movie is jack lemmon's felix ungar jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical tony randall's performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to felix's character which lemmon's portrayal lacks tony's felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jack's felix ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the time br br the movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever one of the other great examples of felix's little notes on oscar's pillow will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after bawling out felix and a scene involving felix's linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comical br br perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning 20 minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with felix's conversation with the pidgeon sisters the movie's ending is predictable and too pat there's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack lemmon's monotone persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters br br it really took the 1970's tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better
<START> you got to go and dig those holes holes only leaves troble which makes a movie so good disney has done it again shia labeouf should be nominated for best actor for his performance as stanley yelnats he has alredy won the daytime emmy for best actor in a comedy series even stevens holes is one of the best movies in 2003
<START> i'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre spoiled br br this movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this you'll say oh yeah that is a ripoff br br i think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once you've identified a plot element is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
<START> lupin sets off for morocco looking for a legendary treasure his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him it's a nice different location for lupin with the desert and that hot exotic feel br br one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual generally being in a different place than lupin on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed but it is a change of pace plus this way lupin can focus on the ladies br br fujiko rules in this throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin and us viewers then there's lara the damsel of this particular tale and she's quite likable this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime which is a fun distinction to have br br there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon as well as some fun scenes with fujiko inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here in fine form br br pretty much this is a smooth ride with lupin the plot is average and there are some slow spots but all in all this movie is a real pleasure enjoy
<START> this is a masterpiece footage in b w 35mm film the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7 35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes br br the short amazingly gets you in a complex story using very little elements and step to step makes you realize that something isn't totally right it expresses a lot makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details and is incredibly understandable by anyone not just the cinema critics experts br br but i know how it sounds european short black and white and low budgeted don't let that scare you is really worth to see by anyone not just experts in the genre br br isn't really much more to tell since the film just lasts 8 minutes exactly and i don't want to spoil it but i just watched it online and i couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it br br really worth watching it 10 10
<START> i cannot believe how unknown this movie is it was absolutely incredible the ending alone has stuck with me for almost thirty years the road sign through the rearveiw mirror blew me away if you liked race with the devil you will love this movie
<START> i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give immortel a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like science fiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runner style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning synthetic humans unfortunately the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the great pyramid of khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there i won't bore you with the so called plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thank yous to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who don't speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesn't help that the animations are poor no better than a video game skip this one
<START> this movie is such a bad work nothing seems to even try and be realistic plot is weak acting miserable actors wondering around like in a 1st year production trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning what a flop what a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a whistle as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat did she ask him politely to bend down for her much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager hungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virgin bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area asking for guidance to scenery spots not a word about last night such a waste of time even to try and write about this low low supposed to be movie
<START> jason alexander is a wonderful actor but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead the fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more cutesy moments with the girl in the train station in the final number with rosie i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent you keep expecting him to drop the nice guy act and start snarling vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you'll see three versions that have more revisions different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical i've ever seen
