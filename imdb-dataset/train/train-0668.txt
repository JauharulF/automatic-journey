<START> my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn't that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it's still a pretty bad film but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn't that good overall it's a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be
<START> those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated george balanchine production live onstage or are letting their disdain for the star casting of macaulay culkin influence their judgement the atlanta ballet was fortunate enough from the 1960's to the 1980's to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the new york city ballet and i have seen it live onstage several times i can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase culkin it was balanchine's idea to use a child in this role just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of marie the heavy dancing is left to the adults in the story br br this is deliberately a stagebound film in a way it resembles laurence olivier's othello exactly as in that film the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage but not made any less artificial and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups and without the distracting music video quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated maurice sendak carroll ballard version there are only two false steps in this 1993 film one is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects mouse squeaks the children whispering ma gic to drosselmeyer etc those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any nutcracker and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on film br br the other false step is macaulay culkin's nutcracker make up which looks absolutely ridiculous when he is on screen as the nutcracker rather than wearing a huge mask as is always done when the balanchine production is performed onstage culkin is actually made up as the toy he wears what looks like a bald cap as well as a white wig whiskers and a beard he also has his face rouged up somewhat and the worst aspect of his make up is that it is still recognizably his face amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to ray bolger jack haley and bert lahr's makeups in the wizard of oz that film's makeup results though worked spectacularly as this one's does not and a comparison with baryshnikov's nutcracker in his production shows how wonderfully creative baryshnikov's nutcracker mask was the jaws actually seemed to move whenever baryshnikov tilted his head back br br the dancing itself in the macaulay culkin version is excellent of course except for culkin himself whose dancing as i said isn't meant to even be spectacular the sugar plum fairy and her cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in balanchine's production of the nutcracker the film's colors though could be a bit brighter since this is a fantasy the choreography is also brilliant and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from tchaikovsky's ballet the sleeping beauty as marie sneaks downstairs falls asleep on the sofa and dreams that drosselmeyer is repairing the broken nutcracker this sequence was of course never included in tchaikovsky's original ballet it is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than the nutcracker br br those who have missed out on this film or those who despise or loathe it should give it a chance despite its two big drawbacks it is far better than it seems when one first hears that culkin is in it
<START> when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended i on the other hand felt completely the opposite i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else people i talked to said there was too much talking plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie going public seems to have a tendency to want easy to follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused they also like to be spoon fed tidy endings happy or sad this disgusts me nobody wants to be challenged anymore and as for the ending and i don't want to be a spoiler i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again it's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny it's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people but it certainly spoke to me give it a chance be patient with it richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass it's very intimate plus ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life they must have improvised during some parts and it works well they have a great chemistry in their roles their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much bravo for romance
<START> i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made right up there with schnaas' other horrible zombie entry zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot i somehow managed barely to sit through zombie doom but zombie 90 is so horribly inept even when compared to schnaas' other horrible film that i had to fast forward through everything after the first 10 minutes zero acting skills inept gore horrible camcorder style camera work ridiculous dubbing it just goes on and on i really can't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film this truly is one of the worst films ever made you've been warned 1 10
<START> terrific film with a slightly slow start give it a chance to get cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an antidote to the hbo hollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name
<START> i've come to realise from watching euro horror especially films made by cult luminary jess franco that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense however franco has gone overboard with this film and despite a surreal atmosphere and the film's reputation as one of the director's best succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film i've got to admit that i saw the american cut version which runs at about 76 minutes but unless it was just the logic that was cut i'm sure the longer european version is just as boring the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around practicing s m and talking rubbish and it's all really boring there's no gore and the sex is dull and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film i had difficulty making it all the way to the end i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere but the positive elements end there jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films but this looks like it was one he made for the money and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works
<START> this is an amateur movie shot on video not an electrifying drama as the dvd liner notes falsely boast i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students the bulk of the story unfolds with an all nite taxi ride around jakarta this movie could have been made using a single video camera but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later the editing is extremely rough the final edit was probably done with two cameras bouncing content back and forth instead of with a proper editor perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english e g where you go now to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous if you're not scared away yet this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta
<START> life begins and ends in a typical 1930's maternity recovery ward where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great grandmothers i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving br br oddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton grace's loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly i'd like to see more of this actor's work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed don't cut don't cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession br br loretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes i've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months br br glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didn't anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies' health but her character redeems herself in the end br br also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as a grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notable br br life begins is a must see precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into 9 out of 10
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br ray ray winstone has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat meanwhile her mother janet laila morse is aware of ray's son billy charlie creed miles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives br br it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way films like nil by mouth highlight this it's a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough if you pick up a little of what it's about from the off set you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this br br it's true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars winstone and burke do deliver some great acting we see winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid likewise in a private moment we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in br br this is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next it's been acclaimed by many including the baftas but it really was just too grim and bleak for me i have no right to criticize it for this knowing what i knew about it from the off set but sadly this is how i found it
<START> any way the wind blows is tom barmans who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'deus' debut movie entirely shot in antwerp belgium the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different story lines are left wide open br br the movie has a purely instrumental sound track that will rock your socks off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shot br br the director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately br br the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too and i loved most of the acting br br the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that interleave br br without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times br br this is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time cheers
<START> the script was very weak w o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called a blessing overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes the obvious in your face homages to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off c'mon this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed
<START> based on fact this is the story of a teenager named homer hickam jake gyllenhaal growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to end up in the mines but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets to the dismay of his mine foreman father and the consternation of the townsfolk generally a misfit for sure he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft times errant rockets unfortunately most of the town and especially homer's father chris cooper thinks that they are wasting their time however the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles only one teacher laura dern in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars director joe johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as jumanji jurassic park 3 october sky surely stands above all of his other films without any doubts october sky is his best effort obviously his best film it's not only a true story filmed extremely well but even as a movie it has every single thing which is required for a top level cinema and along with johnston's extra ordinary direction are some exceptional performances jake gyllenhaal was around 19 when this movie was released he gives a beautiful natural performance he is a perfect actor chris cooper as his father also gives a very fine performance the same goes for laura dern also she looks beautiful even the rest of the performances are extremely well the background score was fine highly inspiring movie which lifts up your spirit sky high one of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment not to be missed
<START> hello this little film is interesting especially for an artist film maker or music creator or a visual artist for br br one can feel and examine david's touch style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity br br you can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots the pans and the sound elements br br even as simple film this creation is multy layer for example there are some sounds that drone all along while others appear though subtle at certain points to support certain shots br br one can see also several types of pans some go up and down in a gentle back forth way there is diagonal pan zooms also go back and forth sometimes br br the lightning and the composition disposition of elements in the space is as usual and obviously work of a painer artist this can be felt even in this crappy room this is to say one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look view and composing the scene then comes the forcelines of the visuals like digonales parallels etc the light's degradÃ©es and the colours although without too much research for textures as in big productions are fine too this is an artist's sketch of a sort br br all this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the david's touch feel to it as with any true artist
<START> you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that ' before you see it the first time ' is implied i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too still it did br br this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough the entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns i would have given this film 10 10 however some of the shots were pretty fake looking i don't hold that against this film too much but i don't think it deserves a perfect score br br lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious as always i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as well br br jeremy northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself however as he changes throughout the film it's like night and day i know some fans of clive owen jude law or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this but northam would could should fit that bill he's suave and cultured he's got a great bond posture and voice i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather down to earth as well br br great film and definitely this movie buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
<START> this is apparently one of shemp's first shorts with the stooges this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team but the threesome's comedic timing is at its honed best here aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot or watch the real object prompting moe's exclamation oh highly polished mahogany br br emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest and the goon may look scary but he's somehow funny he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shorts br br for shemp aficionados this is a must have episode it won't disappoint
<START> when this movie first came out back in 1984 prince was one of the hottest acts around everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video the acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time despite that it was still a very entertaining film morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy especially their rendition of the password which will make you think of abbott costello doing their who's on first baseball routine br br appolina who went by a single name then provided some beautiful breasts so you had the brief nudity covered plus she is very attractive and of course the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded prince later on had a fallout with warner bros and changed his name but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his game br br this movie doesn't rank in the all time great category but it is pretty entertaining
<START> for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to twitch in the original movie heres your chance and then get back to the real world br br the guy who hid the gold in the first movie told twitch so he gets transferred to another prison where wrestling champs hang around looking broody twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman br br then something happens and someone gets shot and the film turns into die hard in another prison but the wrestler's daughter is caught up in it all so he and twitch go to find her and twitch's woman br br as you can imagine the acting is below par it features a lot of really annoying rap music and poorly edited fight scenes on the plus side it's got that hispanic bloke in it who stars in every prison action thriller ever made and he shuts a door in this br br it's not very eventful but at least it's harmless br br if you were a massive fan of the original it's okay ish stuff br br if not you have been warned
<START> i simply can't get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is it's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two br br lemmon had already been in several well known films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time i think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthau's apartment is a tad long so was this sentence that's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time br br i have already written a comment about how the follow up to this film sucked and i won't go deeper into that the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a well i never out of the most prudish person out there it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few f words and that just doesn't fit them br br of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler edelman died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films ever br br add i have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry i didn't mean any disrespect and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah blahing next time
<START> gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time the result is uneven but generally entertaining keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well wantabedde is even better one warning george wendt is very poor in his supporting role otherwise this is quite enjoyable time capsule
