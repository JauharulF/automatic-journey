<START> the sarah silverman program is better than those other shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program the sarah silverman program if you're like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for you br br sarah silverman brings out there funny and right here funny to the table with ease a mix of different styles which makes for its own br br this program isn't something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them other shows this show is its own entity and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine br br go watch and see
<START> i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it when a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation they are torn between believing him and not as the horrifying events of this tale unfold we learn a lot about the father about his two sons and about their destinies with shocking twist after shocking twist this film never allows for a lull in the plot bill paxton plays the father but the most notable performances are that of his older son fenton played by matthew o'leary and his younger son adam played by jeremy sumpter this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot i give this film a 9 10
<START> spoiler below but read on or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent rodentz br br on a moonlit night in a remote research laboratory a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results a chemical compound that was created to hunt and destroy deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building's basement now the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species professor schultz a leading bio researcher has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his hunt and destroy formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors when three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty waste hazard sink shocking side effects result in a night of terror right br br seriously this is probably the worst film i've seen this year everything about it screams low budget from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are clichÃ©d morons and act in stupid predictable ways walking down dark hallways alone looking for a cat tripping and falling so the rats can catch up with them boarding themselves up in a small room etc br br while some films are cheaply made this film really takes the cake every possible corner is cut everything from reusing earlier shots filming the lab hallways from different angles to make it look bigger that reminds me why were only two guys working in this freakin' massive building to music and special effects that could be done on a children's workshop pc br br that brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung the special effects just horrendous the computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated and that giant rat suit oh my god seriously are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster just pitiful on the better side some of the gore looks pretty cool especially considering the budget br br the actors all suck no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing i've wasted enough time with review just take my advice it's garbage 1 10 br br about the dvd the transfer sucks the audio is passable and there's a commentary track on the disk by the director and two of his friends who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments all three of these sub human primordial slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others i don't want to waste any more of you kind reader's time or mine for i am starting to remember more than i want to about this film dvd rating 1 10
<START> in the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films so it's interesting that this one should star shirley temple who had long since established herself as the most famous child star of all time then again she probably wasn't the one being tested i would imagine that would have been frank coghlan jr who played shirley's brother sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance then again a 9 year old shirley temple was probably not an easy act to accompany br br the film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling which i suppose was designed to have shirley temple give a scornful look at the ceiling illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie and provide a clean transition into the next scene which features shirley gleefully stomping in the rain br br it's sonny'y birthday and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give sonny a dog that he really wants for himself but sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since it's curious that when his father insists on getting a dog sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house and as he is running away with no destination in sight it's also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today br br sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks right after a train flew by which given how close to the tracks he was you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks but no matter after sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie it's interesting to consider what a longer film would have done because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end br br not that that matters sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs it might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs but of their lack of power over him as soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear br br hey if that's all it takes all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i'm set br br it's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to but it's cute enough and enjoyable enough and short enough as it were to still be a fun movie we already don't expect an epic plot in a 19 minute film but pardon my pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time and it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made charlie chaplin proud i am hardly an expert of shirley temple's films but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time
<START> after disney's witty live action george of the jungle i had high hopes for this flick major disappointment thread bare plot bad acting bad visual effects this film relied on lame one liners idiotic and pointless product placement and the lamest most annoying side kick in that gadget car thing i took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind the only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin
<START> i've read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movie and the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise com and judge for yourself blessings to all
<START> i really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad the one when samantha and nick are flirting in the hotel the story is so cool and can't wait to read the book bravo for the super station
<START> director f w murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the south seas the documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie the landscapes are beautiful and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch the film loses momentum though when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers the storyline just never gets that interesting despite being handled well by murnau won an academy award for best cinematography although the award probably should have been for best scenery you can't really credit the dp for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location
<START> have i seen a worse movie perhaps only manos the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point let's touch on a few br br there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they don't respond he shrugs and moves on since neither the knoxville or scott know what he's talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was restarted br br the few times the general lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting nothing i haven't seen on the tv series br br very little chemistry between knoxville and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forced br br seann william scott's awful horrendous accent or lack thereof br br i hated willie nelson's performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappear br br jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film that's telling you how horrible this movie is she's a goddess br br during the climax of the film i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his accomplices a nuclear bomb would have sufficed br br this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film br br if only we could erase and start over
<START> to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5 4 rating because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2
<START> made only ten years after the actual events and set in the bunker under the reichstag pabst's film is wholly gripping it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war haven't seen this in over three decades but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave searing bit of dialog between two generals does god exist if he did we wouldn't shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge im toten winkel aka blind spot hitler's secretary and downfall with bruno ganz
<START> here's the good news first spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release the artwork and effects are revolutionary and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone br br and now for the bad news i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it you may remember that spirit got badly trounced by lilo and stitch last summer the first person who argues that it was because disney is more well established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled why 'lilo and stitch''s script didn't stink br br for all the incredible new animation technology on display in spirit the story is almost astonishingly dull there is a lesson here and needless to say it doesn't just apply to animated movies you can have the most mind blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal but if your story is boring and more importantly we don't care about your characters it's bad film making simple as that the animation is still mind blowing i just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it
<START> richard widmark is a tainted character in this movie he is a professional pickpocket he's been in prison three times yet at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four thelma ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody jean peters is amazing as the girl flamed by widmark br br this is a period piece during the mccarthy era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely what is unusual about this film is that peters ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films this is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film br br the film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by fox as the under card for double features in the theater the sets show it is a limited budget film the script made j edgar hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift hoover wanted it changed br br instead it became a b under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953 the script acting in it are better than other big features were that year
<START> the most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called the great ladies of the grand guignol camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday br br what's the matter with helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple in california debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing agnes moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ouch br br the sloppy script penned by henry farrell the man who started all this genre with whatever happened to baby jane along with master director robert aldrich joan crawford and bette davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted motherhood with debbie and shelley's characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars and obsessive female bonding debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat texan are wasted instead we get debbie reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller but still this movie is highly entertaining the two stars and curtis harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws the movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant look at debbie's clothes made with a very tight budget the increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days and you wouldn't easily forget that silly goody goody song that runs through the movie either and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie reynolds' chances at happiness is a hoot to watch br br 8 out of 10
<START> i don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets this movie rocks excellent movie has it all great music prince of coarse romance and drama br br this is really a very sad movie very moving i don't want to say to much more i m not into giving away the plot but i will say this the film is very realistic there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film i see this as being very realistic and being so real makes the movie that much more moving my generation loved this movie growing up so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems br br that said it's definetly not just a movie for teens id recomend it to all age groups and it's not all so dark the movie has some great music band performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia
<START> what a fantastic premise a movie about the berlin airlift it should have it all tragedy suspense comradeship rivals berliner frauleins and tough us pilots love and tears what we've got is a film with none of the above heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so but he fails miserably he acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack he tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy why would bettina zimmermann's character fall in love with him cause they were throwing stones in a lake cause he brings her coal bricks the sfx are very very well done too much though the hundreds or so planes over berlin look like an attack fighter formation squadron rather than an organised airlift Â as it actually was interestingly enough the white house the kremlin and general lucius d clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set notice the same drapes hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty by the way general lucius d clay comes across as a small time insecure looser general who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift he was very much the opposite so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy sad it started out so promisingÂ
<START> recently when i was shopping i saw the box set of americian gothic and i thought 'i remember that ' i used to set my alarm to get back up watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1 30am i was 14 i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck with a b no one ever was anyway br br what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box set as when on tv episodes in funny order i kept thinking when does dr matt leave they made it so confusing br br however this is not the writers producers or directors fault its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don't like originality in studios br br to finish if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci fi fantasy horror supernatural drama fan you must they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box set
<START> we watched this on the wonderful world of disney on abc last night and i came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at the mouse than usual br br since this movie only runs 74 minutes and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time they had and i'm not making this up commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes and during these commercial breaks they had another advertisement in the guise of a tv show hosted by the oh so annoying kelly rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of cinderella 2 dreams come true br br again and again break after break disney took time out of the real movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel thank you disney for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie br br anyway all this commercialism and cash register ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of cinderella because by the time the commercials were over i had forgotten where the story had left off br br but of course the original cinderella still maintains its magic and the story is still a good one though we've all seen it countless times it's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow up
<START> this is the french and belgians doing what they do best it's quirky visually inventive exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling director jaco van dormael takes us into the world of georges a down's syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone just anyone this is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty georges' interplay with corporate management guru harry is dazzlingly handled shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease br br the eighth day puts similar hollywood fare like barry levinson's oscar winning rain man or robert zemeckis's forrest gump well and truly in the shade at times it evokes the humour of milos forman's one flew over the cuckoo's nest with shades of dennis potter thrown in for good measure br br as the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie harry daniel auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance but it is matched by the brilliant pascal duquenne as georges it's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable set pieces the shoe shop scene car showroom scene george's dance to genesis's 'jesus he knows me ' the conference scene the fireworks scene if you haven't seen it there's only one thing to do just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing better still buy this movie sheer genius
<START> the acting fantastic the story amazing the script wonderful br br just a few ways to describe this movie yes it's slow and it has mostly talking but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story i myself am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie i'm also to read the exectioner's song which is the 'other' half of the gilmore story this movie made me think so much about the phrase piering into the other side of the looking glass you hear a song in the movie called gary gilmore's eyes which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have gary gilmore's eyes which is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died and as you listen to it which is after the last time mikal ever sees gary you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others i recommend this movie and the book very very much
