<START> i didn't know what to make of this film i guess that is what it was all about really i have never seen a film like it and i doubt that i really ever will again glover puts together something that is unique to him i think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry maybe see one of his slide shows i really like this guy he is just so bizarre i can't help it note i saw this film before it was through its final editing so maybe what i have seen and what others have seen are different i will know i guess if i choose to view the film again i think i will have to be properly drug influenced
<START> i really wanted to like this movie a lot more than i did that's because i love wacky foreign comedies particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise however although this one frequently caught me by surprise these were almost never pleasant surprises it reminded me of south park in that nearly every social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny for example after exploring adultery drug abuse of nearly every sort ranging from pot heroin speed to glue sniffing prostitution s m suicide murder etc the movie got to the hilarious topic of pedophilia mom encouraged her one son who looked about 12 years old to sleep with neighboring men in fact at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work funny you've got to be kidding this movie just goes too far and delves into the black hole of comedy what should they make fun of next cancer or rectal tumors
<START> first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus single parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it br br second of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close minded in fact i don't recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptight so classical it's really insulting how label classical music in this way br br third i've went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isn't any point at all br br and oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly i'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole time br br 1 10 stars
<START> when i first saw this movie i thought it was the typical love thy neighbour stuff the more the movie was going on the more i got involved acting is magnificent from both actors direction was great the story unusual cried my eyes off first time in my life for a movie a real must have in any serious videoteque 11 out of 10
<START> but i enjoyed this show anyway i've been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show and i'm having a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism in my own head except one that the show was stale this program was anything but stale a lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money pretentious forced overwrought desperate for attention self satisfied annoying ever present narration but you know what i really liked it it was different it was original it really really tried and that made up for all the minuses the show was bright verbal quick witty interesting fun to look at you know it was only on once a week i could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it i will mourn its passing but i guess nobody will be bringing this back to life
<START> the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew
<START> i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly br br the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv series concept like masters of horror it's violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean spirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons
<START> director douglas sirk once said there's a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art' this statement defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramas br br sirk's melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music the music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screen turned canvas but this ain't life but its representation an imitation of life sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood most notably technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing let's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama blackboard jungle rebel without a cause sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else br br another of sirk's statements summarizes this you can't reach or touch the real you just see reflections if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass' i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen one ends up giving up br br therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where there's no difference between real and its false copy nobody can say that the hadley are real people that town ain't real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place so in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower for example sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time br br the angles are the director's thoughts the lighting is his philosophy' in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows the hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way a house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night sirk's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director's craft br br sirk considered himself a story bender' because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose written on the wind is a good example it wouldn't work in any other hands br br the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin who was for 50's comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising tv sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay i'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences the game was played by both sides so it was camp now we regard them as cult' or bizarre' because we are not those spectators anymore that is why todd haynes's homage far from heaven' turns into a pastiche because it reproduces sirk's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film br br sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly there were always immovable characters rock hudson and lauren bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones sirk is interested in too when robert stack flies the plane and tempts' lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river br br in the sirk's universe the studio often imposed happy ends' have no negative impact in fact they worked just great sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud br br it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga i absolutely agree and i'm sure the parallel is not incidental both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan's sonny corleone the action of fighting her sister's male friend is symmetrical the non son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork because both films deal with the subject of power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even kyle hadley's sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power in this case a weakness in sexual power the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane one wouldn't think at first of similarities between welles and sirk's films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family's fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne rock hudson as charles foster kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive amazingly the same actor harry shannon perform both wayne and kane's fathers this detail is cannot be a coincidence br br written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director some say that this is his best film in my opinion magnificent obsession' all that heaven allows' there's always tomorrow' and imitation of life' are just as good and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end
<START> this movie should be nominated for a new genre complete mess except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time calling it campy doesn't even cut it campy implies fun which this movie was not you spend the first half of the movie thinking its got to get better right in fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the brother sister team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr onorati ms pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie br br
<START> when i rented this movie i thought i was going to see a horror movie however there is little horror in this typical seventies mystery drama directed by strange james t flocker nice looking matt boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of flocker's movies is all present
<START> as others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido when men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy and the boy becomes a man really fast we should all be so lucky at this age he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love
<START> can any movie become more naive than this you cant believe a piece of this script and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes the leading actress seems like she wants to be barbie but she doesn't make it the doll has more acting skills br br the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the one good thing of the film is madsen's performance which manages to bring life to a melo like one dimensional character br br the movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth i can think some 13 year old britney obsessed girls shouting o do give us a break if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic i gave it 2 instead of one only for virginia madsen
<START> after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the hopelessness faced by organisations trying to tackle the problem the film portrays the scale of the prostitution seems so large that it's hard to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in cambodia br br anyway on with the review br br although it is a sombre movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film and i'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable the film was well edited for the running time and the performance by thuy nguyen was excellent i also felt ron livingston played a very difficult role well br br it would have been nice to have a little more insight into why patrick feels he has to help holly but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to chris penn's character i won't explain it here go see the movie br br this is a good thought provoking film with obviously good intentions i hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the k 11 project
<START> i hate those stories that begin with a funeral but i'm afraid this one begins the day we buried george not that we buried him in the interests of the environment we had him incinerated so speaks elizabeth judi dench george's widow she's led a comfortable predictable life with george she has two grown children and a 12 year old grandchild but when she was 15 and in school in the midst of world war ii she played the sax at night in an all girl almost all girl band called the blonde bombshells the 'almost was because the drummer was patrick a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed with a yellow wig a long red dress and makeup patrick looked almost as good as the others br br one afternoon after the funeral elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away she used to practice but only when george was out of the house on the golf course then two things happen her granddaughter amazed at how good elizabeth is starts talking about how the blonde bombshells could be reunited and play at her school dance then elizabeth encounters patrick ian holm now just as much an aging oldster as elizabeth and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago he also was attracted to all the other members of the bombshells the roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection well why not see if the other band members can be located and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter's school br br why not one member of the band is gaga one is dead one is in jail one has found salvation with the salvation army one they can find no trace of one is last known to be in the states one is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig even for a reunion but one by one elizabeth and patrick bring together the surviving members of the bombshells we don't know if enough of them can be found the rehearsals more often than not turn into off key shambles while they do this we share elizabeth's flashbacks of what life was like when she and patrick were young in war time london playing in the band while the bombs were falling as terrible as it was it was the most exciting time of their lives when the night of elizabeth's granddaughter's dance arrives of course the blonde bombshells filled with jitters and renewed friendship blow the youngsters away afterwards elizabeth informs us that the bombshells are continuing to play at gigs and that she and patrick have no plans to get married but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around br br this is sentimental hogwash expertly done and not bad at all what makes it work are the skill and charm of judi dench and ian holm when i hear the term warm hearted comedy i usually cringe unless the actors are first rate dench and holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us then there's the old broad gambit that's fun if you remember the old broads among the blonde bombshells are leslie caron joan sims olympia dukakis billie whitelaw and cleo laine laine sings three numbers and almost over balances the production she is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she's singing the program nearly becomes the cleo laine show another attractive feature is the number of great wwii songs played in strong swing
<START> with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler 'the art of seduction' fails to deliver the romantic sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as the two main characters have the potential to be interesting both male and female lead are swinging singles or in the female lead's case engaged but 'the art of seduction' doesn't even try shirking from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities 'the art of seduction' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin lean stereotype br br 'the art of seduction' is insulting insulting to its characters insulting to men and women and insulting to its audiences' expectations it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them ji wan is an immature spoiled manipulative bitch the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty min jun well he's exactly the same neither are nice people the humour in this film primarily revolve around ji wan and min jun's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation no character development occurs and we never learn why ji wan and min jun are like this we are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions they're cute and that's all that matters the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester's reviews may tip you off to 'art of seduction's shallowness br br if you're still in high school you liked grease or you are a yellow fever victim you may like this movie br br despite its romance tag this is not a very good date movie
<START> i first didn't want to watch this film for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinitÃ© which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard screenwriter of prÃªte moi ta main i changed my mind and decided to try it thinking that prÃªte moi ta main would be as good as mensonges and it is absolutely not the script is not bad but it is not as well directed as mensonges the actors not as generous especially charlotte as boring as she usually is as edouard baer or clovis cornillac and too be honest i still don't understand how such crap can have such a success even with such a casting anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots but it is not as good as tirard's mensonges though it's also written by him easy unsurprising and lazy work totally overestimated
<START> director alfred green's melodrama baby face with barbara stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the pre code movies these films were produced before the production code administration had the power to enforce its rules in 1934 inspiration scenarist gene markey and midnight mary scribe kathryn scola penned the screenplay based on mark canfield's story about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society incidentally mark canfield was a pseudonym for producer daryl f zanuck these pre code films today seem tame but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late 1950s when the code began to erode the themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men women versus women and women versus society our crafty protagonist does enough skulduggery that all themes are about equal br br lily's worthless father nick powers robert barret of distant drums operates an illegal speakeasy bar during prohibition when the thirteen amendment outlawed liquor and brews his own booze in a still out back nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he pimps out her beautiful but hard working daughter lily barbara stanwyck of night nurse but lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician the politician ed sipple arthur hohl of private detective 62 vows to retaliate for lily's refusal to accommodate him later nick chews his rebellious daughter out lily reproaches him yeah i'm a tramp and who's to blame my father a swell start you gave me nothing but men dirty rotten men and you're lower than any of them no sooner has she stormed off than nick dies when his still blows up and kills him lily and her african american maid chico theresa harris of arrowsmith pack their bags and catch a ride of the first freight leaving town br br no sooner have our heroines arrived in new york than lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank visually director green shows lily's shrewd ascension up the ladder with camera angles that move upward until lily's sexuality threatens to destroy the bank at one point lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer ned stevens donald cook of the public enemy and his fiancÃ©e anne carter margaret lindsay of cavalcade after stevens had almost fired her for flirting with her boss brody douglas dumbrille of his women in the employee restroom lily is extremely shrewd and manages to emerge from each debacle better off than before the board of trustees hires courtland trenholm george bent of jezebel to take over as president of the bank the first thing that trenholm does is pay off lily instead of letting her publish her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank moreover trenholm ships lily off to their branch bank in paris where lily doesn't create any commotion until trenholm arrives and they become romantically attached lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husband br br ironically lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in but trenholm and she are happy now baby face qualifies as one of the five best pre code movies look for john wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene
<START> i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had only Â£300 000 and 7 weeks to write film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself although this film is not for the masses as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo eroticism involved in the story i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story the more sadness you feel more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned br br this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all
<START> this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based briefly film basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place anyway peter carter the great david niven was going to crash in a plane he talked to june planet of the apes' kim hunter before he bailed out and said he loved her he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor 71 marius goring to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court he is granted this obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe kathleen byron as an angel a brief then unknown lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judge the surgeon david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films outstanding
