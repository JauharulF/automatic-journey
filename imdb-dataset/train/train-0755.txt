<START> obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din the characters that grant mclaglen and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo luke skywalker and chewbacca even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c 3po and r2 d2 and like him or not jar jar binks br br today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today br br to a young boy this was a great film three strong male leads and only a hint of romance there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight too late to lament lost innocence br br hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors
<START> the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies ri'chard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i can't say anything bad about peter galleghar he's one of my favorite actors i love anne rice i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little too real for me i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i don't want to give anything away sorry but it's just not my type of show
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time not just the story but the acting is shockingly bad the dialog sounds like someone reading the news br br this is rated as comedy drama romance it's not of those things it's a little action that's it there's really no comedy and drama at all br br if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you i would not recommend it at all pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better this is pretty much a action crime movie the actions scenes sucked and crime story part of it was very predictable br br if you are not really interested in a good story or good acting and you simply want to look at a 'foreign' film for the appeal of being foreign then this might be for you
<START> 1975's master of the flying guillotine is an amazing and wonderful film to watch this isn't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all it's because the film is so silly and so over the top that it is a camp classic bad but enjoyably bad the film stars a blind guy who has a frisbee like device on a chain that chops off people's heads as he expertly throws this at his foes who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier mache arms or that the guy was blind it's just a ball to watch from start to finish and one of my favorite bad films and great to see with friends br br because of this film i was eager to see the fatal flying guillotines 1977 though sadly it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knock off taking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable sure it's silly fun but it never comes close to master of the flying guillotine in entertainment value like the original film there are these weird flying devices that sever heads but they are quite different with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own there also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what's occurring in this english dubbed version as the plot is completely incomprehensible however at the same time some of the martial arts action is very good while not up to the high standards of most bruce lee or sonny chiba films the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot br br overall this is a film that martial arts fans may like despite its many many many many shortcomings but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous but most importantly it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying guillotine too bad
<START> riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers gregg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration interviews animation and surfing footage the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant viewing personal highlights include any of greg noll's comments what with his straight to the point frankness laird hamilton's footage at teahupoo and the out takes at the end of the movie but really this entire film is one big recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it's a shame it isn't more well known but it is a gem deserving of attention 10 10
<START> red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected action br br some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 min's and 88 of the movie is on a plane and just talking don't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog br br a pg 13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller br br this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later rounding off this cast is brian cox from x men 2 br br the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight plan br br here is my flight plan comment http www imdb com title tt0408790 usercomments 578 br br i recommend not too long and not too shabby br br 8 10
<START> semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldn't she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexican english accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but that's not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers br br during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
<START> i've now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband john all are quite terrible of course but this is certainly the pits featuring the usual flimsy plot bad scripting Â by the director naturally Â and acting not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired hemingway but who continues to appear and talk to her in fact he wants to come back in another younger bodyÂbut actually does so only in the very last scene derek is lovely as always and still playing naÃ¯ve Â especially during a muddled mid section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa quinn too is typically larger than life read hammy here but this easily constitutes his nadir besides for much of the duration he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo his 'replacement' then is obviously a handsome looking stud who hasn't a lick of talent or even personality also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray as quinn's best friend and bo's business consultant and julie newmar as quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife Â plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire donald trump who presumably needed this on his resume' it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film that the end credits are filled with useless and corny expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand and that ghosts can't do it swept the board at the 1990 razzie awards
<START> spoilers the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner's henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever that and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiner's invention mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny i particularly like it when crow kills mike with his 'touch of death' and when he revives him in the theatre mike cries guys i died i saw eternal truth and beauty oh it's this movie that would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide some of the puns in the film were wicked police inspector electrocution crow shocking isn't it police inspector that's lowe all right tom servo very low right down by the floor police inspector can i get on tom servo he's dead but knock yourself out mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer
<START> alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored contacts br br this is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing lisa raye and monica calhoun stand up and and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying whoa whoa whoa hold up let's chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood's movies br br if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating please tell me another movie that's worse than gang of roses br br i'm through
<START> new york i love you finally makes it to our shores but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over valentine's probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar new year and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan no not the spy next door and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success so why fix a formula that hasn't been broken br br continuing in concept where paris je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise shanghai will be next so says the end of the closing credits here the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else well it was shot in black and white but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least br br structurally this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created here a little more leeway is given where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise though already seen in paris br br one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one is definitely the creative forces behind the stories from writers directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city coming together for a concept film and what more the star studded cast too with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances be it for the entire length of the short or as a support to build upon you can't deny the initial star gazing in recognizing the notables from irrfan khan to natalie portman who also had writing and directing duties rachel bilson looking quite like bardot to spielberg's blue eye boy shia labeouf who surprisingly can act and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date br br story wise like any anthology you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you and with others that don't some are straightforward in nature while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked but these 10 stories plus 1 because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks somehow lacked the more anything goes spirit from its predecessor with stories more rooted in reality compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film elijah wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone or even less adventurous with its narrative style christopher doyle's and tom tykwer's starring natalie portman here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment br br minor quibbles aside i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here contrary to what many others have felt about it the short film format is still very much alive and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore i love you so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road otherwise there's always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules
<START> rohinton mistry's multi layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion emotion humour and pathos the story is somewhat slow moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy all of the actors are indian few if any known to western audiences but they are a joy to behold especially the little girl who acts very convincingly don't be put off by the title and plot summary this is a movie to be seen on the big screen we have much to learn from it
<START> level one horror br br when i saw this film for the first time at 10 i knew it would give me nightmares it did surprisingly as i recall it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them br br level two psychoanalytic theory br br later as an adult i saw the story for what it was what if the savage unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest br br level three pure science fiction br br the best way plausibly to realize the plot's what if is through the science fiction genre this is pure science fiction not the cowboys in space that passes for the genre today br br after 43 years forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films if planning a remake skg or lucas watch out
<START> i honestly had no idea that the notorious b i g bert i gordon the director not the murdered rapper was still active in the 80's i always presumed the deliciously inept empire of the ants stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of the coming a totally obscure and unheard of witchery movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day salum massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum for you see this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state the man who attacked loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge but poor and three centuries older loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl Â or is she burned at the stake unfolds like a mixture between the exorcist and witchfinder general with a tad bit of the time machine thrown in for good measure way to go bert the plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like the dunwich horror and the devonsville terror the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692 which keeps it rather amusing and fast paced the ann putman girl is quite a fascinating character reminiscent of the abigail williams character in the more commonly known stage play the crucible also depicted by winona ryder in the 1996 motion picture there are a couple of cool death sequences like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with ann putman and perhaps even the devil himself the film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end but overall there's some good cheesy fun to be had plus the least you can say about bert i gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years
<START> this is easily one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen it's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline this movie is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes while the acting is mediocre at best the biggest problem is the script which is poorly written slow and plodding with no real direction occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event i'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script as a huge fan of good horror movies i'm always irritated that something this bad gets made save yourself 98 minutes you'll never get back
<START> this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting i never tire of watching it i especially love the scene where danny glover's character and kevin kline's character namely simon and mack have brunch together kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often so its a very 'real' movie br br one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where mack's car has broken down the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words and lastly mary mcdonell is brilliant as always
<START> a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director's best a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ben gazzara john ritter and blaine novak persue fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film audrey hepburn colleen camp dorothy stratten and patti hansen much of the script was ad libbed or re written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cab driver patti hansen on the side john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena this film has some great performances by a supurb cast standouts are audrey hepburn she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film ben gazzara has never been better and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat a tat tat delivery highly recommended stars
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know the feelings they are having are normal it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age who knew that we would bounce back again and again great movie
<START> this movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable this is the best movie ever made i just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 i also can't see why anybody would not love scarface anyways if you havnt seen it it is a must buy
<START> i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldn't like the movie but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv digital video the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation warning the following maybe a spoiler the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning
