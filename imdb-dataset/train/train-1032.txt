<START> ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of the lord of the rings i wondered what the hell is 'rotoscope' animation well i finally found out i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is and i liked it a lot very good story line it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon see it if you get bored with contemporary animation don't get me wrong i'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon it's a pretty good movie too
<START> no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much sinatra's modus operandi on set br br i feel that as the 1960's wore on the quality of the man's films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin's matt helm series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in shambles his music fading out sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950's the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan's express in 1965
<START> poor paul mercurio after landing the role of scott hastings in strictly ballroom the best film in history he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish none of the characters in this film is very unlikable or even hateable but mercurio's lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore completely unloveable and he wears overalls big mistake in costume design that one
<START> disappearance is set in the mojave desert as jim harry hamlin patty henley susan dey plus their two kids katie basia a'hern matt jeremey lelliott along with ethan jamie croft a friend of the family are travelling along they stop at a roadside diner ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver no one claims to have heard of it but it's definitely there the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out take some pictures once at the town they take some pictures have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won't start they have to spend the night there while looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared the next morning their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn what is weaver's secret will the henley's ever leave there alive br br written co executive produced directed by walter klenhard i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched for the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history the script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on from the families car mysterious disappearing the four recent graves the thing in the abandoned mines the supernatural sandstorm the sudden unexplained disappearance of ethan his just as unexplained reappearance the sheriff's sinister motives the compass in the car going crazy the crashed plane the townspeople denying weaver existed the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near weaver in the 40's but they are all tossed out of the window for all we know could have been totally separate random events everything was coming along nicely was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming instead i was treated to the most ambiguous strange surreal downright frustrating ending possible if nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before leaves the viewer with more questions than answers it's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn't know what to do with them just made the ending up on the spot i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute br br director klenhard does a reasonable job here the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation it's well made but what were they thinking with that ending nothing fits nothing makes sense it's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour a half leaves you confused wanting to know more despite being a horror film there's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here there the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes 2006 remake for large parts as that is what the film is set up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film br br technically the film is good with high production values good special effects sets locations cinematography set in america but filmed in south australia the acting is fine from a decent cast br br disappearance is a really odd film for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers i really can't see anyone making head nor tail of this i really can't
<START> undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin' 80's which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub genre like hard rock zombies blood tracks terror on tour and the especially ungodly jon mikl thor starring stinker rock'n'roll nightmare tended to be that aside this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f x razzle dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid 80's teen targeted scarefest moreover the film's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny famed greed decade heavy metal god ozzy osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti metal tv evangelist br br marc price the hopelessly dweeby skippy on family ties gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie ragman weinbauer a geeky socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who's constantly picked on by the stuck up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at lakeridge high school the cruelty and mean spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy eddie's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi curr an impressively whacked out portrayal by tony fields perishes in a hotel fire hip local disc jockey nuke kiss front man gene simmons in a cool cameo hooks eddie up with sammi's final unreleased album which when played backwards resurrects curr's malevolent spirit back from the dead sammi encourages eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor eddie's life the proverbial living hell only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would be accomplice it's up to eddie assisted by token nice girl leslie graham likeably essayed by the lovely lisa orgolini to stop sammi before things get too out of hand br br ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher smartly written by michael s murphy joel soisson and rhet topham and capably acted by a uniformly up to snuff cast this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty jump moments an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight a rousing carrie style high school dance slaughter sequence a neatly utilized halloween setting revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status
<START> de sica is becoming one of my favorite directors but this one was a hit and miss for me a grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside milano it is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses complete with evil capitalists and trigger happy police forces but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale as the boy wonder toto develops unlimited superhero powers i had it up to here with the ever smiling toto after 10 minutes and when the magic took over i was left in the dust there were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots so many good characters among the settlers that i kept thinking it was a waste the movie wasn't more serious with its material the coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the look what we can also do mum sort than as a fully developed piece of work art
<START> this story about three women is a very sensitive study about muriÃ«l charlotte van den eynde the youngest laura els dottermans who is about 37 and martha frieda pittors the oldest who is the mother of muriÃ«l they live together in the same building they have different expectations of life the vital laura wants a child muriÃ«l comes from a village and wants to change her life in brussels martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something for instances an accident which could dramatize this story as times goes on you discover that the director dorothÃ©e van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case so one is left with a feeling of emptiness
<START> sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it Â and still it is not easy to explain why i liked it that much this is mostly true for the uncommon movies Â the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there goodnight mister tom is one of these special movies there is a lot of emotion in that movie Â and the acting was so good that while watching the movie i was crying and laughing as the story went on the young nick robinson Â is a young boy william evacuated from london because of the air strikes there during the second world war mr tom played by john thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to br br at first tom refuses to take any responsibilities such as taking care for a troubled young lad Â but accepts since he is left without a choice during the stay mr tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the william Â alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son Â not to hesitate to use it this belt is berried in the field Â never to be used in such a brutal manner mr tom provides a real home for william and the boy is happy with his new life he goes to school makes new friends and discovers hidden talents all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling wellÂand it starts all over again Â only this time it gets much worseÂ there are many feelings you can sense in this movie Â love fear sadness happiness pain hope Â and much more goodnight mr tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with others such as dear frankie and billy elliot Â if one is to compare i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of zac Â reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood
<START> according to imdb takashi miike's master of horror segment imprint was banned in the us so i figured i'd translate the swedish review i just wrote for it br br it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer director takashi miike's episode in the masters of horror series and the dvd cover of imprint did in deed look very promising br br the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello some time during the 19th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow br br the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american english but i will leave it at that it's not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes the extended torure scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated and pornographically intrusive that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water and in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust br br the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago for me most memorable as frank nitti al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables 1987 i've always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago i'm grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh memoirs of a geisha 2005 who plays the deformed prostitute br br the finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind of you know blah and i looked at my watch again for the umptieth time just wishing the crappy episode would end maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but that's only because i couldn't help thinking of an episode of red dwarf and the upside down chins of craig charles and danny john jules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens lucky you if you've seen that episode and now decide to see imprint i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you br br my first thought when imprint finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series and that if anything is a big friggin warning don't you think br br one might point to the costume design by michiko kitamura and say that there at least is something not lacking in style and refinement but there are so many other films and tv shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese geisha fashion this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed takashi miike's masters of horror episode is boring uninspiring and pointless in other words it's really really bad
<START> with a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last moment br br don't let anybody tell you what the short is about since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one man show directing writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer her reaction shots are incredible br br overall rating 8 10
<START> well i can and will be very short this is a wrong balanced non convincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go from funny to cliche wise serious it's a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the hacker is in florida or no he is in madrid no he is in he is screwing the signal br br 4 out of 10
<START> at first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 restriction filled with hyper violence drugs gore sex including lesbian sex some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop but then this movie is a succession of bad story so thin bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad monty python bad music '80s hard rock the videotaping is awful the ending is a real shame plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive and those vampires reflect in a mirror and don't even fear daylight you get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a space mutiny or troll 2 i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 because that's its real place br br i'd say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer br br 3 10
<START> i agree with the previous comment what a disappointment rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it i was surprised by their performance expected more since they're good actors br br thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse i even laughed at some bad stunts when is supposed to be a mystery movie you can even guess who is the killer beforehand br br for real what happened br br sorry to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and money br br boring
<START> i was really impressed with this film the writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple it's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters and getting the viewer sucked right into their world further the music is terrific they employed some independents to do the score and some of the soundtrack and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival like i did i highly recommend that you go see it also on a personal note paget brewster is beautiful in this movie that's reason enough to go check it out
<START> how can someone not like this movie this movie is so good that the first week i saw it on the shelf at the video store it was stolen best horror movie ever i mean he took the carrot and he well you know hahaha how is that not funny the only movie that comes close to touching this is bride of chucky and that was just great
<START> the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers in my view it would have been better to leave this out i think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop the comment of one of a policemen this aint f ing disneyworld is apt br br nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot
<START> words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film it's one of the most wrenching you'll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta and a heart stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book he's the 1 pick for 1988's best actor in danny peary's alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its tears and unless you're made of stone there will be plenty of them
<START> what an awesome movie it was very scary great acting well written nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non horror fans but is still nonetheless one of the best thrillers out there today i highly recommend it to only fans of br br 1 the horror genre br br or br br 2 an actor or actress featured in it br br out of stars br br ps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream ya know what they didn't want to be like scream everyone's like oh they copied scream well if i am not mistaking scream also copied other movies too in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one scream however was a good film but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is br br go and rent this one br br
<START> let me start by saying that war inc is not everyone's cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap the comedy involved the film isn't obvious at all it's quite subtle tamerlane tanks dry cleaning service etc and it changes with the twists turns in the plot br br i may be the only one but i won't compare this with grosse point blank because it's different john cusack i wouldn't say he was amazing or brilliant but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines comedic timing even though she was hardly in the film i'd say the same about ben kingsley br br marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unreal br br overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesn't have a particular storyline and it's quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message i'd say it's worth a watch
<START> silly movie is really really funny yes it's got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but it's laugh out loud funny all the way and it's worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film
