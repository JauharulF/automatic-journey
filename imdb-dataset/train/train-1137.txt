<START> bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse bruce almighty is a good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is first rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey's facial expressions i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man i thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 6 7 out of 10
<START> this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girl correction his dream girl apparently there is a difference and i'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dream girls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream girl creative in the sense that it's a far out plan but un creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day jobs to come to the set i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic it's almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless you're interested in seeing chad lowe's early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv positive gay guy on the series life goes on or gail o'grady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franz's buttocks but those are unlikely motives i'd say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose i'm surprised i watched it all i guess it's the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self flagellistic inner issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge
<START> for starters it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh check out the two russian bugs br br a bug's life has a classical disney storyline but that's one of the good things about the movie family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end and it also has a couple of great voice overs by dave foley julia louise dreyfus kevin spacey of course but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation it's just wonderful all the details great colors every ant looks different beautiful backgrounds and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic all in all a very nice piece of work this is the best animation by disney since aladdin
<START> you just got to love opening sequences like the one in seven women for satan Â during the intro there's a naked girl running through the woods chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he's simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers oh i'm sorry i was lost in my thoughtsÂ he then says sweet i have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title you immediately know that seven women for satan hasn't got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside this is in fact another sleazy variation on the classic milestone the most dangerous game about a lunatic's disturbing hobby of hunting people Â preferably hot naked chicks in the forest for sports well actually this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic as writer director actor michel lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to leslie banks' legendary villain in the most dangerous game count zaroff supposedly is the original count zaroff's son but he exchanged his private island for the remote french countryside he also can't afford to be unemployed anymore so he's an office clerk from monday to friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones his butler once pledged to prevent the zaroffs from killing but he's obviously doing a lousy job there isn't any depth in the screenplay and the build up certainly doesn't pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere really the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for zaroff's deceptive trap and hope they'll reach seven rapidly half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing i have the impression that it was michel lemoine's intention to imitate his pal jean rollin and make a deliriously kinky sex thriller seven women for satan is a french production so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard vernon the awful dr orloff zombie lake lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer but not the talent to depict one
<START> drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt br br after dee rents a flat from a hack writer her encounters with 'the other drew' become more frequent writer dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real drew' out of her stupor so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew that's hot br br best scene just might be where drew stabs her real life mom jaid with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day
<START> the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message br br spoiler they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger
<START> dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton's character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey merk
<START> at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen apart from that is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen while watching the movie and even upon post contemplation it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that performances every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives even so apart from that does not feel like a documentary or reality television but instead transcends into a category of its own with its unique cinematography and direction i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker br br this movie must be seen
<START> whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined same plot different kid more villains which leads to more endless stupidity in the traps the other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom people may as well watch the other films for plot as it's all identical
<START> i bought unhinged because i got suckered by the gory picture on the cover if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie br br having said that let's look at the plot a group of college girls driving to a rock concert by way of the deep dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid slide off the road no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began br br the two remaining girls wake up in a big isolated house the house by the way is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film for some reason though this house has no roads going to it the only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch who looks like george washington in drag and her equally homely sexually repressed daughter the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of gilligan's island for that three hour tour br br by the time we the viewers get to the kill scenes we no longer care we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film it's almost as though the ending the one good idea in the film was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it br br unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting inept directing and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film sorry i'm not sure where that came from you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when for some reason that is never explained the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering don't waste your time you'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back
<START> i didn't really like this movie that much at all it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie br br final query br br theaters so glad i didn't squander too much money on this br br dvd purchase ummm let me think no br br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
<START> the story is similar to et an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home while its stay on our planet it will create friendly ties with humans br br but unlike et which exudes drama comedy poetry this movie is only fun it is indeed a pure dysney production its core audience are children the movie is more more in the visual than in the message br br thus you will find some funny scenes the first sighting of the town a cosmic stray toaster and the casting is experimented with special mentions to doc who rejuvenates in a mac fly character and to hurley who seems open to auto derision br br ice on the cake the main title is scored by danny elfman and like every other great composer you recognize his voice before he is even credited
<START> in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult crap for you see the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments andrea bianchi's masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some
<START> this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of they saved hitler's brain the worst movie i have ever seen period when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with br br the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness some flatulence jokes some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering there is no difference with a french accent was well you get my point br br the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was
<START> i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again but with different actors and a little bit different plot i will say the cars in the film are very cool so if you like fast cars then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining i also liked nadia bjorlin because i've seen her from days of our lives she is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie i mean songs about cars not exactly what you would here on the radio since it is a hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life i don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as nadia bjorlin who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer it's just all very silly br br another side note any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and screws michael over priceless br br final verdict this movie is for car freaks so if you like fast cars then i'd recommend this
<START> i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them don't know what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the friday's so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that don't rely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no movie br br john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they don't no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not the same you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall it's the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just don't know where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor br br in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life silently locked up in an institute as loomis his doctor says to sheriff brackett i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e vil that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no one know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well br br what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesn't she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are fogged up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesn't but it's astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond br br halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps maybe director's should follow in his br br halloween personifies everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness then halloween is a film that should be seen it won't let you down i enjoy being scared i don't know why but i do but nothing has scared me in the 90's except maybe one film wes craven's final nightmare if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not wanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watch br br and just to follow up after seeing zombie's version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie bastardized his version but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one
<START> a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels it isn't supposed to but it does this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema obviously 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed one can listen to rock and roll music one of the songs played is the song hey babu riba ala the title of the movie but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess unlike a heavy handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire a great movie worth seeing again and again repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend
<START> when a friend gave me a boxed set of 12 amazing scifi horror movies i was understandably a little cautious but since the item was a gift i really didn't truly pay my common sense much heed after all movies for free so what if they are a little ropey after much consideration alien intruder was the first of those movies ironically it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch all i can say is if this is the best of them i shudder to think what the rest are like br br on the surface it had some good things going for it four count 'em actors that i was familiar with billy dee williams tracy scoggins maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway i told myself billy and tracy have been in some good scifi star wars and babylon 5 respectively so they wouldn't sign up for a turkey max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film but not too shoddy an actor an jeff well he's done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add the ugly to his repertoire of movies br br the first clue was in the opening scenes jeff mugs his way with gusto through an i'm mad scene before finally killing himself an amusing cameo performance really unfortunately this is without much exaggeration the highlight of the film it goes downhill from there br br next up we have the commander of the mission williams who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element but this assortment aren't so much the dirty dozen more like the unconvincing foursome plus one of the crims a computer hacker is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer isn't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer pretty lame prison if you ask me br br when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kits br br but the horror doesn't stop there whilst on route to the area where jeff's ship vanished the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality in which they indulge their male fantasies all well and good and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the alien menace which begins to appear there but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong alien intruder alien boring more like br br finally they make it to g sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left the ending in truly optimistic rubbish film vein hints at a sequel as if also making an appearance in this movie is a character i'll nickname the sweatdroid he's supposed to be an android but apparently that fact was lost on the make up crew who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity but don't worry he's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end br br williams and scoggins to be truthful do very little in the film they only just barely stay awake let alone act and as i mentioned earlier jeff gets an early trip to the showers so his manicness isn't allowed to enlighten much of the film max tries his best as do a couple of the other cast members but the movie is just direly atrocious to be honest br br the one and only half way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention they are all named after musicians holly presley joplin the rest of the film is bland and uninspired br br made in 1992 i had thought on initial viewing it was one of those 80's straight to video jobs looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90's it seems br br it's best avoided even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker but at least you can fast forward it i suppose
