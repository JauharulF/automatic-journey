<START> four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe franks and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires there's also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula br br this is a good horror anthology nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire also the house itself looks beautiful and very creepy it's well directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound
<START> what is it with americans and their hang up with religious gobbledy gook to think this was a best selling novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers in this case all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with kirk cameron as a cnn type journalist trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh yeah there's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine or something the good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such inane dialogue that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs not recommended for anyone with a 3 digit iq
<START> bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day steals the body in his fake ambulance hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep bela's wife eternally young some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible terrible mystery bela lugosi hams it up nicely but you can tell he needed the money br br this film is thoroughly awful and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film i got the dvd in a discount store 2 for Â£1 which i think is a pretty accurate valuation anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind
<START> this is a very moving picture about 3 forty something best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time br br spoiler spoiler alert spoiler br br the main character is taken by her young handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted
<START> american movies about war and nazis simply cannot be good they can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda all nazis are bad crazy too proud and americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human come on stop this bullshit the main character says something like by this trial we have to make aggressive war a crime is america a peaceful nation with its world 1 420 billion defense budget 2 china with just 51b is it simply spent in this without any roi why portray america as a peaceful nation when it isn't i deeply dislike movies with an agenda they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something hollywood should put a label on movies just as record companies have that parental advisory label we should have a bullshit advisory propaganda advisory or a politically correct advisory label on some movies this is one of them
<START> i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoe br br foxes was such a huge departure from all of that br br where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy little darlings anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction br br this was not disney this was not porky's this was not halloweed this was a dark powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly it's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevant br br it's not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver br br 7 out of 10 barky

<START> saw this my last day at the festival and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in it's own strange way it's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper realistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled it i hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences cassavetes malick loach altman the usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition lynne ramsay david gordon greene you're in for a real treat this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it if this film plays in a festival in your city go go go
<START> this movie is ridiculous that's exactly what i like about this piece of guilty pleasure it is easy to condemn this movie for not including pat priest and butch patrick the original marilyn and eddie but look at the year and do the math pat priest and butch patrick had long outgrown their parts time does that to young stars yvonne de carlo who re prised her role as lili was pushing the big 6 0 even though she still looked good and was still the perfect lili br br it's a shame that yvonne de carlo wasn't given a larger part still it was good to see fred gwynne and al lewis in the roles that made them so famous during the 2 seasons that the munsters was on prime time it was the gwynne lewis chemistry that made the series such a success the rest of the cast were supporting cast members not to say that they weren't needed they were the tv series wouldn't had survived as long as it did without them given the choice between butch patrick or happy derman the original eddie the choice was too easy yvonne de carlo was also the better choice over joan marshall br br though this movie doesn't measure up to the original tv series it still measures up nicely and is one of the better reunuin tv specials that plagued the boob tube during the late 1970s early 1980s br br '

<START> once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn't work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he's not bad but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he's not bad he's just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power br br i can't really recommend the film its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment
<START> return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character stanley returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting i've personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first
<START> uh oh another gay film this time it's showing the black side bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending but why with only less than a half dozen exceptions all gay films have to end in death or an addio finale it's like all the european film noir releases in the 40's 50's 60's and 70's the lead male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion why in god's name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed after all it's supposed to be gay not glum maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film a large percentage of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset no matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle this movie just proves my point if you rent the dvd take an antidepressant for here comes another 'gay' film this is wrong
<START> more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von trier's fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role
<START> i love bad shark movies i really do i laugh hysterically at them and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them culminating in the premier of their new original picture hammerhead shark frenzy based on the previews it looked like it was going to be highly amusing essentially a remake of benchley's creature really it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3 megalodon which is shark movie hilarity at its best i was in the mood i was ready to go bring it on hammerhead mad scientist man oh god was that movie wrong br br wrong wrong wrong br br sick twisted messed up br br this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst my friends when a drugged out girl is brought out of suspended animation and strapped to a table screaming her head off because the shark human hybrid fetus the absolutely insane scientist deliberately implanted in her womb wants out jesus monkeys that's what i call disturbing br br that's really how the plot works hmmm thought the mad scientist my son died of cancer but i brought him back to life by combining his dna with that of a hammerhead shark because sharks don't succumb to cancer and further hammerheads reproduce via placenta oh look a perfect amphibious being i've created the next evolution of the human race i know let's make him reproduce but darned if all those shark genes have't made my son bloodthirsty instead of raping the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise he keeps eating him but check this out among the random people who have by way of some unimportant plot twist ended up on my research island is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died i bet he'll do her all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion woman you're going to impregnate me mad scientist no he is indicates thrashing shark person in tank how sweet br br do not watch this movie ever
<START> answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth br br the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the less than wonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clichÃ©d line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de marco as jake puts in a particularly good performance br br fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if you're not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film jake's closet is suitable for mature adults br br the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
<START> i really enjoyed watching this movie about the delany sisters i knew of them but that was all this movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage what a pair what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms this is not only a movie for african americans but for all americans it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years both sisters are quite different from each other they came from a very loving and very strict family with high maybe even impossible standards of perfection it is sad to see how sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day
<START> i won't mention any of the plot because although it would be highly predictable anyway the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere in the movie comments in the plot summary here and even in the synopsis on my netflix envelope i might have enjoyed it more if i hadn't known that maybe this film has a deceptively good cast most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand including donald sutherland lesley ann warren and tia carrere and rosemary dunsmore in smaller parts it was impossible to like william mcnamara but that was clearly by design and there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian lenore zann but none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me don't any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on
<START> you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab the sister i keep thinking 'watch out she's a vamp for those that know buffy angel br br a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money br br i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it br br umm 1 10 because that's the lowest it will go
<START> i love all his work but this looks like nothing sorry this looks more like a david lynch copycat i think people like it only because it's from david lynch
