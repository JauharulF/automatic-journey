<START> you're using the imdb br br you've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films br br it's something you enjoy doing br br and it's all because of this fifty seconds one world ends another begins br br how can it not be given a ten i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight exactly how could the first film ever made be better for the record the long still opening shot is great showmanship a superb innovation perfectly suited to the situation and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch all this within fifty seconds br br the word genius is often overused br br this is genius
<START> i haven't read this book but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head this is so vonnegut i have never seen an author all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel translated so well to film this movie had the same complexities found in vonnegut's novels the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes br br campbell was also a very vonnegut character portrayed perfectly by nick nolte he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut hero lack of concern for political boundaries ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him br br overall i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie it was the same feeling i had reading cat's cradle my first vonnegut novel as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen he thought of that and he made it real and important yes he has nothing but army surplus white christmas albums so it goes
<START> much to her adult children's chagrin nearly immediately after elizabeth's dame judy dench husband's death the widowed attic tenor saxophone player becomes bent upon openly returning to her musical hobby now that george is dead elizabeth no longer has to practice playing sax in the attic as she grows more pleased with playing in the open elizabeth takes a stroll along memory lane remembering when she was a 15 year old member of a jazz swing band the blonde bombshells supposedly an all girl wwii group of talented jazz swing musicians one of the blonde bombshells' band members was a womanizing cross dressing drummer patrick ian holm with whom elizabeth remained friends br br both patrick elizabeth's 12 year old grand daughter joanna millie findlay press elizabeth to round up the former band members take up performing together again this time as a bunch of sexagenarians among the band members she finds are the still foxy bass playing madeleine leslie caron dinah olympia dukakis a trumpet playing alcoholic out spoken money grubbing divorcÃ©e widow living off of wealth from her many ex marriages in a craigievar scottish castle gwen real life us star jazz singer clio laine having at the lead vocal annie june whitfield as the salvation army trombone player betty the late piano player joan sims who's located training the ivory keys in a hastings pub br br as elizabeth patrick joanna scout the world for members of the 1940's band try to convince them to resume performing together elizabeth is oft times beside herself as she learns more than she wants to know about their adult lives including her own while having a blast playing terrific music with the last of the living 'blonde bombshells' br br amusing nostalgic historical sentimental multi generational entertainment that is seriously fun the actors deliver wonderful performances regardless of their ages they are still bombshell entertainers who put on quite a show the dvd is now out worth owning because of the bonus features dolby digital sound surely as a fan of any of these terrific actors the vhs is a collector's item
<START> in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often the plot is unrealistically convoluted the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check once again he has assembled an impressive cast like woody allen everyone wants to work with altman that this time around to the letter is miscast but that's only part of the problem br br kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex husband and a loony dad with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale br br branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going hipster bob downey jr is every bit as bad as a p i but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible the female leads embeth davidtz darryl hannah famkhee jansen are lean leggy and unemotive even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos vernon jordan are wooden with the few throw away lines they have br br in addition to paying little attention to his actors altman's mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless his action scenes comic book it lacks his offbeat touches and observations he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia that make a well done altman so unique unfortunately gingerbread man is altman at his worst even if the pay is the same
<START> the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two br br oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it i suppose i was thinking more leisure suit larry risquÃ© than the producers were br br definitely not a pg 13 movie which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones br br i liked it but i doubt it will be a smash hit which is sad as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to
<START> street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire this is not a movie you just watch for fun it is not a comfortable experience although it does have some laugh out loud moments this is a movie you watch when you need food for thought br br to dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely this is not only a satire of song of the south it's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people through this wild exaggeration the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly held beliefs really are br br if you're the sort of person who's willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds and if you're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye this movie may be for you
<START> what is jamie foxx supposed to be funny does he really believe he is funny well it's funny watching his confidence in being funny the man has no identity whatsoever i mean you can immediately see who his idols are denzel washington and martin lawrence because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies the only problem is that he does it bad uneven and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel with that macho s t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence the funny and clumsy silly comic there's no personal touch to all that i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally he really is mr dull boy in person br br i was really hoping hollywood and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom like don cheadle for example but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old
<START> when they killed off john amos's character they killed the show he was the vital part of the info structure you had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how they were poor they were black and they were living proof that if you have jesus and your family that nothing is too hard sure james would lose jobs and jj would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way br br james was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children florida was the strong lady that would everyone including james when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it the kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit their neighbor willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family things were bright gritty funny and honest until they changed the course of the program james dies and jj took over the show br br flo was still mom thelma was blossoming into a lady and michael was still the militant midget but jj was the show we were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment i guess james's paycheck didn't do much for the family they were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working i know that jj flo thelma and even michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real james worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame br br jj was the comic relief but i felt the show need substance it's ok to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the jj evan's show i mean really here was a guy that was failing in school he kept getting laid off and he painted for money in about two episodes james had always been there to encourage his talent but flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care br br why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do he could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards he did but something went wrong with that why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams i'll tell you why it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams the show stopped teaching us about growing building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases they should have kept james if any show needed a father it was that one
<START> erroll works for the department of public safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders i don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes allison erroll is now training her to do his job and it's like job shadowing allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn't realize how much danger she really is and it's all erroll's fault he starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isn't to be a police officer br br it's a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his scope of practice erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of allison it has some good mystery to it too and just when i had it figured out there was more to it
<START> this is an hybrid creature born at carl macek mind with robotech the second generation robotech masters and megazone 23 into one miserable movie that have no logic the story is very very bad and you cannot forgive the action of megazone when have nothing to do with robotech if this movie have so high rank is for the tv series and not for itself i did said it the name cannot save this
<START> things i learned from the list br br a decent cinematographer a hot girl who can act and malcom mcdowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking br br blockbuster won't give you your money back br br even when he reads the script and says ugh really malcom mcdowell still tries br br chuck carrington desperately needs acting classes br br hire a writer br br jesus hates me too and punished me by making me pay 5 50 to see this movie br br when making a movie you don't need an ending just leave everything unexplained unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending genius br br any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window so make friends br br your maid can sing you back to life br br chuck carrington still needs acting classes br br your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie br br apologies will not be accepted
<START> what a real treat and quite unexpected this is what a real thriller movie is all about i rushed into the video shop grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best i was totally surprised and delighted i really enjoyed the actors and their characters i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic the plot was well thought out well written and directed it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute br br i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention definitely a 10 out of 10 from me
<START> this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it as the credits rolled the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film br br yes it was formulaic and predictable but that somehow added to it's charm the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions br br a real feel good film punctuated throughout with outstanding music when it's released i'll buy it
<START> i loved this movie and will watch it again original twist to plot of man vs man vs self i think this is kurt russell's best movie his eyes conveyed more than most actors words perhaps there's hope for mankind in spite of government intervention
<START> if you enjoy cleese all the british 'pythonesque' humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely hilarious br br arthur lowe is a real treat br br i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated br br perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously br br i can't believe it is now only available in the us ntsc of course and not in uk where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour
<START> i don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i tolerated the first season br br unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bit br br that aside spader and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations it's certainly not here their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first but since that's what they're doing literally all the time i've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tear jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show br br alan shore's flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress denny crane is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit br br i'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care br br i think the show's writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start the thing is i don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more i'm not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn't to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings br br of course i'm writing this after i realized that it's really not gonna get much better than this it's a shame because it's one of those shows i'd love to love
<START> why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film br br it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining br br i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre br br 6 10 come on yankies get your english up to par
<START> with these people faking so many shots using old footage and gassing animals to get them out not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors what's to believe old film of countries is nice but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films i know racism is ok in these old films but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility portrayed as fliers they never flew their planes martin johnson was an ex vaudevillian used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties denying his wife's apparent depression using her as a cute prop all this makes these films unbearable they were by no means the first to travel to these lands or the first to write about them he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer but that's about it
<START> while this movie isn't a classic by any stretch it is very entertaining as i remember it i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed arthur and though it isn't as funny as that movie it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with arthur
<START> this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized there are two routes to take in horror films either you don't really explain what's going on or who the killer is like in texas chainsaw massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of this br br unfortunately creep fails in this area i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation no character is fully realized although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story br br in the end this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film making that drag down the film br br this film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift br br creep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment but sadly that's about it
