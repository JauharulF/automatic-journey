<START> the case of the scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento br br ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who dunnit quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery it also makes sense in the end a big plus 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herrings and ultimate solutions here the less you know about the plot the better br br pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography the catchy music score the gorgeous females anita strindberg is a goddess brutal murders black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few br br in most parts it's decently acted goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well martino directs with a sure hand keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces br br if you're a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general this comes highly recommended
<START> read my lips sur mes lÃ¨vres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope br br the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies br br the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu br br writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrÃ©e for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well br br none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake outs br br there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths br br this is one of my favorites of the year br br originally written 7 28 2002
<START> the adaptation of will eisner's spirit to the tv screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages or comic books remember the two aren't exactly the same medium it is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation as of the time of this writing of eisner's smart alec wise cracking tongue in cheek super hero br br story has it that republic pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid '40's but they were never able to close the deal the left over screen play became the serial the masked marvel one of republic's best perhaps that it was just as well for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips pulp mags radio and the comic books br br as for this 1987 made for tv movie it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series whereas an old long time comic reader like myself can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look like br br well while sitting and watching the story unfold with the characters interacting amid some crime wave the little lady my wife mrs ryan nailed it with one statement this can't make up its mind if it's serious or not that pretty well describes both the spirit and his creator mr will eisner the true creative genius in the comics br br the film is a sincere attempt to put eisner's world on the screen the casting of denny colt the spirit commissioner dolan and ellen was really quite well done though in a contemporary setting it was still in the tradition of the good old days as far as the costuming goes you know when men and women still wore hats that brings up this one final and meandering point and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a will eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language we say kudos to them for their efforts br br it's just too bad that no series followed oh well in today's motion picture world comic adaptations seem to be a hot item maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really 1st class spirit production for the big screen we can only hope br br update dateline chicago illinois 6 4 2008 by now everyone who goes to the movies at the shopping centre multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of the spirit subtitled my city screams which is to be released christmas day 2008 well we'll see then just what we've been talking about just keep your fingers crossed to be continued br br update ii we saw the new film writer director frank miller's rendition of the spirit a couple of days ago well we got our wish but is this a good thing or another case of be careful what you ask for because you may get it please read our write up elsewhere in imdb com thanx
<START> i recently watched the '54 version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the '76 remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the '54 one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institute's top 100 list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list
<START> fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race all falls apart though when young timmy's zombie fido eats the family neighbor from then on disaster well maybe not disaster but to some extent chaos occurs most of the people treat their zombies with fairness and one such character sleeps with his zombie very funny part of the movie if not also very disturbing too and we find the loving fido whatever he may do this is a very funny and unique film especially for the zombie genre it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies no negativity in this statement i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different i rate this 8 10 rated r for zombie related violence
<START> this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons 1 perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android 2 it wasn't an android at all but a woman the beautiful jean marsh br br the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly in fact the modernization of sex bots are in the news as i speak br br robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star br br the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity normally no one cared but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine or downright carelessness
<START> you don't expect much from a prc picture and with rare exceptions mainly from edgar g ulmer and a few by joseph h lewis or lew landers that's exactly what you get not much this epic about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isn't much different the script by longtime prc hacks arthur st claire and sherman lowe is trite laughable full of unfunny wisecracks and plot holes the size of outer mongolia the direction by longtime prc no budget specialist al herman is semi comatose at best the performances though except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king aren't really half bad veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up he's got great comic timing charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik despite his spanish accent and veteran bad guy george j lewis as renaldo's arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch and she and renaldo have great chemistry together although like the rest of the cast she has none at all with king h b warner whose career stretched back to the silent era lends a shred of dignity to the low rent proceedings even though he blows his lines several times and prc being prc they weren't cut out there's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big budget silent movie with a similar arab theme although i have no idea which one it is and prc being prc no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous i've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious br br a yank in libya isn't very good of course well ok it stinks but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor director albert brooks and super dave osborne but had never actually seen him in anything before it was worth watching this tenth rate prc extravaganza just to see him in action otherwise forget it
<START> i was first introduced to eddie by friends from across the pond who know i like intelligent humor i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller in 'dress to kill' eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time there is a wide range of subjects in this stand up and they are simply hysterical the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches br br thanks andrew and catherine and do you have a flag
<START> jennifer's shadow is set in argentina starts as jennifer cassi gina philips arrives there after her sister johanna dies jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will jennifer decides to sell the house head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen faye dunaway is opposed to the sale however strange things begin to happen jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her she starts to feel very ill after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared what is happening to jennifer is it an ancient family curse will jennifer be the next to succumb to it br br this argentinian american co production was co written co directed by daniel de la vega pablo parÃ©s is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes a tedious predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them the script by vega parÃ©s p j pettiette is pretty slow going tedious which is not what anyone wants i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down be bored out of their skulls the character's are all uninteresting fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy how did he know about the demons what is his interest motivation for getting involved i couldn't see it jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable bland leading lady her grandmother mary allen is as clichÃ©d as they come it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain i mean for this sort of mystery based horror ghost story it's surprisingly predictable routine there are gaps in both logic the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like jennifer's shadow one iota br br directors vega parÃ©s goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all just makes the whole film look dull lifeless there's a definite 40's period look as well from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted cheap looking jennifer's shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable it's not scary or creepy it's rather predictable if that wasn't enough there's no gore either there's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people a beating heart but nothing else br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it's us international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly is obviously there for the money br br jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies 1964 again instead a total waste of time
<START> it all starts with a suicide or is it a car crash i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call this is one powerful movie maybe that is because i'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances but either way a film works best when it truly touches me when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated sappy and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness so i'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown with all that though i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing that secret mission he is trying to complete it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring leaving us off kilter trying to comprehend what is going on smith's thomas has lists of names one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give themÂa gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend barry pepper and reminds him to do what it is he promised to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as pepper's you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background hanging above everyone's head it is his character seen maybe three times that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with his breakdowns whether tear streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way br br after that phone call begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns from a blind vegan meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donor necessity heart patient unable to print her line of stationary or even run with her great dane duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first as is why this man seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home is now living in a motel driving a beat up car going door to door in order to audit for the irs as he says though he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help he takes his job seriously crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them he must do it at every step though you see the suffering in his eyes the pain eating away at his soul taking each step towards his fate one as a saint of redemption not only for those he wants to help but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles because while they are fun this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyÂat least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch perfect handicap with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout whether on the phone being yelled at sitting in a diner eating his pie or at the piano in the park playing for all who will listen elpidia carrillo as the abused mother is fantastic showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last
<START> i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling witty dialog and great acting but that's not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in later seasons but the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience but pushing daisies is more than it's parts it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season
<START> this is a truly abysmal lock stock' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a Âmovie' i use the term loosely gummo' i feel like suing that so called director' for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films
<START> if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back spoiler rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant instead of using the criminal justice system the victim resorts to using vigilantism she in essence nullifies the judicial system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the accuser no
<START> don't waste 90 minutes of your time on fast food fast women it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing horrific acting and even bad music i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen she needs the fast food br br spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting like trimming your toenails you'd have more entertainment value br br the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser but she deserves much better than this tired script it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie br br viewer beware
<START> assuming this won't end up a straight to video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you're bored of good well executed movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didn't care anymore about the plot not about insulting the director that is awkward when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie a shot out shattered window before any shots are fired and then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come unfortunately br br i'll spare you all the details but this is sub par in every manner even the half assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half assed acting from him and the rape scene christ shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever br br 3 10
<START> my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not please please don't renew for another season as enough is enough bob
<START> although misty ayers burlesque stripper is certainly attractive as the blonde lead this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times no nudity in 1954 when this film was made not 1965 br br the guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott costello most of the other woman are unattractive and the drunken woman is semi amusing in a creepy way br br a 2 out of 10 ms ayers has a curvacious physique but you can't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post dubbed some of these exploitation films usually made later than this one are interesting in some way but this is really a bore fest sid melton make room for daddy directed there are some samurai like facial expressions and interesting apartments but there's really nothing here
<START> mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing he is a true spiritual leader only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example according to the movie he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father when things went wrong with harilall mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy br br had it been any other parents they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet mahatma didn't do that he is true leader who leads by example
<START> baby face is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck an almost unrecognizable george brent and theresa harris it's about a girl who goes to the city to make good or should i say make time stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy depressed filthy erie pennsylvania after her father dies one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there and not the easy ones and to take the high road in life note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut this part of the film was redone for the censors she and chico harris go to new york where lily nickname baby face decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster in the movie's most famous scene the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job trouble follows and she's soon involved in a huge scandal br br stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets and she's great at playing the innocent victim in one scene she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top then she asks chico for another case and that's filled with more jewelry plus securities all in a day's work br br theresa harris was an interesting talent she could be played down or glamorous and was a talented singer and dancer as well here she sings or hums the movie's theme st louis woman throughout she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck's her best work being in the precode era as a bizarre byproduct of the code blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place br br precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore though they're 70 years old seem more modern even though these films didn't have to have moral endings baby face learns her lessons how like life it is after all there were several endings of this film all with the same message the one i saw had an added scene but apparently there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors there wasn't a code but there were always censors at any rate it's a neat surprise baby face is an important film in movie history a must see
<START> there were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be but i guess that's part of it's charm detective philo vance's powers of observation seem greater than all the oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed the dropping of the dagger into the chinese vase was the kicker for me i mean couldn't somebody have just dropped it br br vance william powell had a line early in the film about archer coe's 'psychological impossibility' to kill himself i had to think about that for a while i was left wondering if there's some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true not having studied psychology myself seems logical but then there's always the case that doesn't fit the rules br br you know i got a kick out of the agitated coroner etienne girardot who reminded me of star trek's dr mccoy the couple of times he stated i'm a doctor not a magician and i'm a doctor not a detective i can picture deforrest kelley watching the film and saying to himself 'i'll have to use that sometime' br br once the killer's identity is revealed it doesn't seem like such a big surprise but up till then it's really anybody's guess but archer and brisbane coe aside the film didn't answer the central question posed by the title and the murder i was really interested in who killed sir thomas macdonald's dog ghillie
