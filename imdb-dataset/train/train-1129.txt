<START> i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles one of my all time favorites the tv pilot for black bart stunk the plot was non existent and the acting was not good it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take offs of big movies but this one would never have worked considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the n word thrown around on the other hand i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces there were quite a few actors actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years i had to write down all the names and do a few searches that was fun i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash i won
<START> addictive is an adjective i've heard many times when talking of certain tv shows most recently dramas like lost heroes and prison break have earned that description however as compelling as they may be and they really are i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series even prison break which some have lazily classified as the new 24 with all due respect there can be no such thing and for a good reason no other silver screen thriller is based on a real time structure that's what sets 24 apart from any other show and that's why i practically have to watch an entire season on dvd in seven days or less once the frickin' clock starts ticking it's impossible to tune out br br an episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of nypd blue and more recently deadwood having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours one per ep the actual running time is 41 minutes the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced non linear storytelling a mandatory element nowadays and it truly paid off br br ironically enough the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding fortunately creators joel surnow and robert cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere looking extremely relaxed jack bauer kiefer sutherland is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter kimberly elisha cuthbert and minutes later being tender with teri leslie hope the wife with whom he has just reconciled as in the sopranos though something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner not only has kim snuck out of her room jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately at midnight i'm afraid so bauer is a ctu counter terrorist unit agent and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of david palmer dennis haysbert an african american presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day oh right i almost forgot events occur on the day of the california presidential primary no time for napping then jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case unfortunately he has a tendency to ignore protocol and that doesn't sit well with george mason xander berkeley a slimy man from division who has been asked to interfere with the operation br br the plot is very dense making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly the writing is sharp and precise the attention to detail unsurpassed and the suspense is consistently sky high mainly thanks to the real time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level br br another great quality of this pilot is the characterization most genre shows sci fi and thriller tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on a textbook example is csi where character development is minimal but then again that matches the show's unique style whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people among whom jack sutherland's best role ever and palmer the real revelation of the show stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only the former divided between job and family reckless but humane the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype mason and tony almeida especially but two factors ought to be taken into account a this is the first episode b there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a flaw or two after all how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy a missing teenager and a huge explosion and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season br br tick tock tick tock
<START> this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different it plays right into the multiple universe theory br br the only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry burrows james belushi has such a hard time understanding what is going on that everything has changed br br
<START> carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them although the story isn't strong the action is fun and draws you to the very end which i felt could've had a sequel br br campy and dark this is great ol skool kung fu
<START> the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else br br i wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one br br saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
<START> the 100 black and white half hour episodes of the early situation comedy mr peepers were originally broadcast from 1952 55 on nbc like a lot of baby boomers this and ding dong school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts br br mr peepers is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the honeymooners and i love lucy the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows which is probably why they still seem contemporary br br mr peepers which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone may appear slow and dull in comparison but it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers credit should be give to the show's producer fred coe a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out philco television playhouse lights out playhouse 90 producers showcase playwrights 56 fireside theatre etc even on kinescope br br mr peepers offered a much more gentle style with wally cox to be the voice of underdog a few years later in the title role robinson peepers a mild mannered high school science teacher his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer br br the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast tony randall played his brash best friend history teacher harvey weskit jack warden played frank whip the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements br br there is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse nancy remington patricia benoit with viewers quickly aligning with mr peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy their on screen marriage near the end 1953 54 season captured national attention an early version of the who shot j r frenzy br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> 12 year old arnald hillerman accidentally kills his older brother eugene his feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him or feel it is not the right thing to do his only refuge is his grandfather who is the only one who seems to have compassion on him the realism will captivate true 2 life movie lovers but will not satisfy those that desire action thrills
<START> bruce lee was a great martial artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air it just gets downright absurd from then like something out of a cheap comic book maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there usually all made in hong kong i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion despite bruce lee being in it
<START> i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i'm talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 north america so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure
<START> new york i love you is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long the shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common love every short is about finding love either if it's about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting the film stars an ensemble cast among them shia labeouf natalie portman hayden christensen orlando bloom chris cooper andy garcia christina ricci irrfan khan robin wright penn julie christie ethan hawke bradley cooper rachel bilson and anton yelchin with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise i was expecting a tremendous film the problem is new york i love you doesn't add up it remains the sum of its parts some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless orlando bloom christina ricci and ethan hawke maggie q segments that it's appalling the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone story wise it seems like something a few film students could put together having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by eli wallach and cloris leachman walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary and it's moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because there's a lot of potential here but as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing the editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more fitting in the end new york i love you feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences there's highs and lows it's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others br br 7 10
<START> although the actors were good specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary a famous theatre director hilmir snÃ¦r guÃ°nason becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his destiny lilly being sightless since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and ears here this movie is becoming a roadmovie and the longer the road becomes the closer their relation develops which was predictable since the beginning of the film the theatre director is on the road to his mother jenny grÃ¶llmann his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations of course what should she do other and she is still living because she is waiting his son to die my god this are destinies br br finally the son arrived mum is celebrating a big party at the beach wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune yes they are celebrating her farewell the son arrives just in time mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german while the son is answering with a rough accent because the son is unable to see he is not falling in love to the nurse the film script would have become also too complicate but is looking for lilly on the way back to home br br parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her who has first to booze himself to courage the occasion is favourable because mum tina engel is on journey together with the lover of lilly paul harald schrott they are after lilly to bring her back paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love because the film script would have become too complicate the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too i would suggest an architect or a pianist or course a famous one when they finally find lilly they want to convince her to come back to paul because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her but lilly felt in love to his pupil the theatre director did i mention that he was even a famous theatre director br br this is german film art as you may see in this pretentious production that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films this film is really embarrassing i have the impression that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit being a co producer i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness barfuss already the spelling of the title is not right barfuss dvd cover writes proudly a til schweiger film this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw filmfÃ¶rderung hamburg and the ffa br br please don't spoil your time with this film there are really good films in germany watch out for film directors like marcus h rosenmÃ¼ller joseph vilsmaier hans steinbichler hans christian schmid faith akin
<START> bela made 9 pics for monogram but it was only at this one the 4th that things started to come together all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production writing and character development from here on better or worse the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes in the basement in the old house that causes things to go blooey this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings he came on board for black dragons the flick before but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing and was around for all the rest of the monograms casting is key in these and it's a pretty good one b movie wise here you get barclay and harlen also from black dragons along with russell who would star in lewtons' cat people movies and rosetto from spooks run wild a nice slice of poverty row talent if you have limited time and budget start with this one it sums up everything they had learned up to this point and gives you something to compare the rest to the plot bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young they both like to sleep in coffins if you can read that and smile the rest will be easy
<START> the subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre the latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would've gained a cult following br br aside from that the first season was truly hilarious witty clever with superb writing it was promising the first season's excellent brew had the right ingredients characters actors storyline and so forth plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot nora and her fellow photographers on the prowl night after night day after day for the exclusives br br a lot of things don't make sense to me like how this show and another fav of mine gross pointe never made it if only the first seasons of the naked truth and grosse pointe were released on dvd please anyone out there
<START> okay i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do from pat morita's loveable interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay leno's annoying yell i laughed throughout this movie as long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world it's a good mvie br br my favorite part is morita talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second
<START> caught this movie on the tube on a sunday i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none i was shocked at this i always look at the hated it's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves
<START> br br i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same mainly because of my feelings at the end i and all the people around me were simply touched this is something you don't often feel we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard a man on the verge of a breakdown this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie br br the acting from branagh and bonham carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie br br the title comes from richards masterpiece a plane made of junk and his old paintings flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end br br a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone don't let the subject matter put you off
<START> as we all know the sub genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days br br coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you don't use it you lose it what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development there's still the weird off the wall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message br br the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer it's like my life story br br the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie br br i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it's quite simple it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults br br when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part br br actually since we're talking about steve carell i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that br br to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i can't believe i just wrote that br br my review from frider waves http friderwaves com index php page virgin
<START> i was lucky to see oliver in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager later during the summer of 1969 i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in leicester square london after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year br br th success of oliver on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood this legendary story by charles dickens which is part of the literary heritage of all english speaking people was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968 the sets and musical numbers are mind boggling the song who will buy required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the british film studios such as shepperton good show other film studios at elstree boreham wood bray denham and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years
<START> for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors mis attribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes br br i didn't give this a 1 primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for something br br so watch it for fun but please don't take it as historically accurate
<START> with this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the 1930s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
