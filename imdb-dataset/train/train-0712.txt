<START> the extended nuclear family united in business as well as in personal life is examined in this serious study of a grown son's conflict with his father's desire that he remain in the family business this triggers a midlife crisis which may or may not be ameliorated by an affair and retreat to a shrink's couch very fine acting by all a sleeper that deserves wide attention
<START> universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return br br this film is a sci fi action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad they're good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them i'm really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already but just in case don't
<START> along with it's partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
<START> water lilies is a well made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship sciamma works with specialized slightly sanitized material that is as off putting to some as it is alluring to others the film focuses exclusively on three middle class teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team br br such distractions as parents siblings work and school have been neatly excised from the equation the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie pauline acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be marie worships floriane adÃ¨le haenel an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after this takes marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump anne louise blachÃ¨re being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers inwardly flroiane doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt br br marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante all the other girls think floriane a slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases because it leads them on she suffers the pretty girl's fate of being not a person but an object and she can't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap enlisting marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother won't know she's going out to meet boys she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later it looked the opposite at first but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls' br br keeping all external context at bay sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls' goals and interactions on the other hand the film's water madness which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever present goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things it's the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in a way that there aren't more of them but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves br br there's no great revelation or drama on the way but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesn't just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends whom floriane always stops before they go all the way in a typical irony of this kind of plot floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie but marie is the one who holds off because she knows it won't have the significance to floriane that it will have to her when it happens it's a timid mechanical affair meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois warren jacquin a male swimmer but of course he is after floriane boys are not an element that's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available studs
<START> peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york or loisaida as it's known by the locals br br mr sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family that is typical of the different 'inner cities' of the country mr sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents these are basically good kids the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing br br instead of presenting his characters as losers mr sollett shows a positive side they all have these kids are not into drugs or are stealing because they are poor had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children that are struggling but deep down inside they are not defeated br br victor rasuk as victor vargas was a revelation he is a natural so is july marte her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn't want to do altagracia guzman as the grandmother is excellent she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her br br all in all this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett
<START> these guys are anything but the usual suspects they are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that no one is better than william h macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck this is probably his best performance since fargo sam rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also luis guzman brought some great comic relief as cosimo and george clooney stole every scene in his cameo role the heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious br br the direction was also spot on by the russo brothers there was certainly a coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers they have a long way to go to match the coen's but this is an excellent start and i look forward to their next celluloid outing yo mutha's a whore
<START> i saw a lot films about charles dickens' christmas carol but this one is the best of all there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book the actors george c scott and others are great unfortunately you can't often watch the film in germany and switzerland
<START> this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awful br br part of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeau's character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesn't do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri baruc br br another big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focused br br the real problem is it's simply not a pleasant movie to watch it's slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this it's the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
<START> this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full length feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie so many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing wilson wilson farris thurman were great wanda sykes was under used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time 7 out of 10 for me more of a dvd rental also i was looking for some sort of a feel good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade mark to these romantic comedy films a la something about mary meet the parents but again i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines it felt like it was rushed into theaters

<START> this move was friggin hilarious funniest i've seen in a while akshay and john kick ass as always and the chicks are hot too the story is awesome lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron don't rate movies u don't understand what did u watch the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation thats what i thought jackass br br akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility he can do not only action but comedy as well and is excellent at it john has proved himself as well this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> i must tell you right up front i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful however if you've never seen one don't start with this one i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one but i just couldn't stand this one i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film it was that annoying so why was it so annoying br br 1 there is a character named 'rambha' in the film he is even more annoying than jar jar binks which i never would have believed would have been possible he is so annoying he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief instead he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die slowly his voice his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in and he needed to die br br 2 the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak 47 bullets with ease i kid you not there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles and again and again they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians this made stallone's actions in rambo ii look mundane br br 3 the film was so gosh darn loud in your face and intense it practically made my brain bleed it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth crazy camera angles intense music and action action action this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100 action br br 4 the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense none whatsoever br br perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film but as for me i can see why it's on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list wow this film is bad and intensely bad
<START> the humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the sunday school dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you're dead for the devil's scrutiny i e so the devil doesn't care when you're dead there's no percentage in trying to beat the devil the characters apparently didn't pay attention at sunday school and find themselves forced into crisis management having eschewed crisis avoidance but even a seasoned ceo would have difficulty managing these crises throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin when people are involved the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films until now hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other lumet all stars like steiger and pacino
<START> while i don't agree with bob's and tammy's decision to give up baby jesse and it's something i'd never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost unheard of as far as i'm concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that she's psychotic or at least that there's something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think it's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that'll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others' perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution you may even grow while watching this movie and it's all worth it in the end
<START> i received this movie as a gift i knew from the dvd cover this movie are going to be bad after not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it what a pathetic movieÂ br br i almost didn't finish watching this bad movie but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie br br trust me when i say this movie sucks i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie but it couldn't have cost more than 20 000 to produce this movie all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera about 15 people with no acting skills a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people br br in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter tara woodley run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town he are completely unharmed they went to a supposed to be abandon house but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems br br then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost zombies stories br br the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history br br his story br br sgt ben draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion i think this is what happens after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ben draper br br buries him in a shallow grave br br but sgt ben draper are in for n big surprise his wife girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt ben draper to take revenge on private wilson next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf br br the twist ending were so lame br br even if you like b horror movies don't watch this movie
<START> taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience in my opinion their mission was accomplished a must see for young children pre teens teens and their parents ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order but parents with young children should sit tight the movie moves on to better things i am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women not syrupy about it either nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills a lot to like in here laughs doesn't take itself too seriously a real mystery to solve one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus and likable characters nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion
<START> i like movies about morally corrupt characters but this was too much the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the real problem the issue was the sinking feeling i got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film these characters were hollow they had almost no depth and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts these characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly
<START> this is a pretty bad movie the plot is sentimental mush i suppose the production values are ok decent photography unobtrusive direction and all that mark hamill was terrible i've never cared much for him and this movie validates that perception it's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his star wars films i'll just say buh bye mark as he sinks into well deserved obscurity on the other hand a very young annie potts utterly stole the show she showed charm beauty and acting chops all in one performance i remember seeing her in texasville recently and taking note of her beauty it's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier anyway unless you are interested in miss potts run away from this film screaming for the hills
<START> spoilers ahead if you want to call them that br br i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1 10 where to begin we'll start from the top br br the story don't believe the premise the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are it's a draub basic go to cabin movie with no intensity or effort br br the screenplay i usually give credit to indie screenwriters it's hard work when you are starting out but this is crap the story is flat it leaves you emotionless the entire movie the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of woah you totally freaked me out and i was wondering if you'd uh if you'd like to uh would you come to the cabin with me it makes me want to rip out all my hair one strand at a time and feed it to myself br br the characters holy crap some have described the characters as flat i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards br br the actors worse than the characters are the actors they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting the woah you totally freaked me out was said so monotone and slow like it was dumbed down i could complain for hours on the actors alone br br technical lighting an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie too shadowy in areas too bleached in others the director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly baby steps sound how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie 9 with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured there is one scene in particular that really sticks out these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle weak camera learn to use it br br anyway i'm running out of complaining space rent it i dare you rent it and learn from it give it a 1 rating it deserves it br br signing off amanda christmas
