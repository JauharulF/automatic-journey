<START> british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories butterflies is perhaps the epitomÃ© of the first type br br the scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered br br the acting and scripts are always on the money which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one i was neither blown away by it nor turned off my mother on the other hand adored this show i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies
<START> it's a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i'd hate to think of him going out on free money not what his fans ought to remember him by br br brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work brando is the warden of a local prison which in america when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout br br unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers charlie sheen and thomas haden church their hearts still belong to daddy br br not to fear because brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have what to do but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury br br although free money has some moments of humor for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter but also straight arrow fbi agent br br of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century were it not for brando's presence and were it some 40 years earlier free money would be playing the drive in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they're being satirized br br or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them
<START> this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal i thought that avi did a great job in his role and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see i think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really don't want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future
<START> let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didn't give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005 br br the show centers around the hennessy family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife cate katey sagal their daughters bridget kaley cuoco kerry amy davidson and their son rory martin spanjers when ritter was on the show i would shriek in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that he's gone i'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh i'm very glad that i fell for this show's trance after ritter's untimely death because it made the eps with ritter so much better br br ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded that you can't help but love him he is always bossing the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy it's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment br br katey sagal is great as well and she too is a likable character after ritter's death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco davidson and spanjers because she and ritter had been friends for a long time br br the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy played by kaley cuoco she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dim witted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humor and how conceited she is br br amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry but that's the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about she's always after bridget and her character feels like it's just thrown in there br br martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show he's mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for rory br br david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for c j spade's character garner plays cate's father as a bit of background information br br all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it you'll enjoy it br br 9 10 spy
<START> every year i watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight to dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see i have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films i have ever seen Â in fact i still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it br br the day after it seems like some kind of weird dream did i really see what i thought i saw why do the police work out of a warehouse did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers is it safe is it safe is it safe br br i wouldn't recommend zombie nation if you want to see a 'good' film and neither would i recommend it as 'so bad its good' however if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever Â this is for you now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is i will say zombie nation br br seriously Â i think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude he really is the ed wood jr of the digital age and i for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one
<START> virile but naive big joe buck leaves his home in big spring texas and hustles off to the big apple in search of women and big bucks in nyc jb meets up with frustration and with ratso rizzo a scruffy but cordial con artist somehow this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty sometimes brutal urban america en route to a poignant ending br br both funny and depressing our midnight cowboy rides head on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change and thus confirms to 1969 viewers that they themselves have been swept away from the 1950's age of innocence and dropped dorothy and toto like into the 1960's age of aquarius br br the film's direction is masterful the casting is perfect the acting is top notch the script is crisp and cogent the cinematography is engaging and the music enhances all of the above deservedly it won the best picture oscar of 1969 and i would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade
<START> the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can't say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don't see jon bon jovi as a bad ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen
<START> i thought this movie had absolutely no moral i mean how would you feel if your fiancÃ© left you on your wedding day for your cousin i would be heartbroken it's classified as a comedy but i didn't find it funny at all i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them i normally love julie stiles movies but this is an exception jason lee stars in another disgraceful show which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this i understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is 'just a movie' but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen i'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie you are a bad person as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable i'm just saying that in real life people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful
<START> br br this is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide out trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion breeding orchids and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt she doesn't know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead the story is quite original the performances outstanding i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one still the melodramatic touch is present the film is typical british the jokes aren't vulgar there is no violence involved it shouldn't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching 'saving grace' it will be so much more fun especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious i thought my jawbones would burst 9 10
<START> first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it i gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all however the big alligator river the title my dvd calls it is better than your average nature strikes back movie br br a tourist resort in the jungles of southeast asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god kroona a giant alligator but the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters a photographer and the resort staff have to worry about the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too br br this movie is a pretty well done adventure horror story with a good musical score and direction but the alligator itself the main attraction of the movie is obviously fake looking some of the close ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see some of the underwater far away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop but the natives are believable if not authentic br br probably not the movie that will give you non stop thrills if any but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention and like a lot of creature movies this one ends with an extremely high body count it also has lots of good jungle scenery acting is below par though but who was expecting it to be better eh br br much much better than its recent american counterpart primeival but nothing to be compared with jaws but remember it may not be engaging at a few points
<START> this movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent larenz tate's portrayal of frankie lymon was not good especially in musical performances he doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are larenz tate when he should have been frankie lymon the portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has hollywood written all over it the powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic the positives of the movie were miguel nunez's portrayal of little richard and the cameo of little richard himself lela rochon is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role it's too bad that the talents of halle berry and vivica a fox were wasted the whole frankie lymon saga was fascinating in real life too bad this film was a wasted opportunity
<START> i have no idea why they made this version of persuasion when they already had that fine mini series with amanda root and ciaran hinds i suppose that they wanted to make a feature length version but of course a lot had to be deleted alas what ended up on the cutting room floor was all the lovely wit and humour leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and mores br br also the characters were shallow and uninteresting they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain wentworth like a silly modern adolescent and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this let me tell you running after a male like a female in heat is not cool that is something a well bred woman of the napoleonic era would never have done and certainly not this level headed heroine br br some have said they found this antic laughable my reaction was not laughter but outrage the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contempt br br it was ghastly
<START> this movie forever left an impression on me i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the brady bunch i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil however this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives one at a time what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn't see it
<START> the fourth man paul verhoeven netherlands 1983 br br a film based on a novella by gerard reve that works best as a thriller that's quite surprising considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work br br the fourth man is top heavy on symbolism paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out in the fourth man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity of which there's plenty but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes there's hardly a scene without sex or full frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story br br nevertheless when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round thom hoffman and jeroen krabbÃ© in particular br br camera obscura 7 10
<START> wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen this person should never make another movie i cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience you have have wasted every cent no concept of real life i have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back ever everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed i'm embarrassed for them all of you should be ashamed if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years please never watch this movie i have never written a blogg about a film before but the distaste for this film has compelled me to do so
<START> this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings especially when you think that this is zukovic's first large scale attempt br br one warning do not take the movie's message that seriously it is not for mass consumption and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized post college neophyte view of society br br i did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious 'zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90's
<START> i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit malibu express with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one shot director the plot written by sidaris which was ungratefully passed up by the academy is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy cleverly ksxy is actually their secret headquarters in fit to kill they confront their long time nemesis kane who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds a well written screenplay is not all excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic panned by the critics and the box office this film will be appreciated in years to come it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did but in the future will undoubtly become recognized i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking the costumes the special effects all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself my personal rating is 10 10 the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero andy keep up the good work
<START> i just saw this at the venice film festival and can't quite decide about it we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didn't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates at a running time of just over an hour the characters weren't very well developed lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment forklifts conveyor belts shovels and the slightly creepy looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people an interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together
<START> after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for pushing daisies and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pd br br first off to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show something along the lines of i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction realistic on this show pushing daisies is truly pure and utter escapism it's colour palette the dialogue used the scenarios situations music all of it to me is just an escape from everyday life an escape from the mundane and boring it is here where pushing daisies exceeds exceptionally well pushing daisies isn't for everyone a large majority of the television audience don't get it for some people it's just too out there and silly but for people like me even from the first episode i watched of it season 2's frescorts and i was just blown away by the show from then on i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player other people i know can't stand it it really seems to be like marmite br br the show follows the adventures of ned the piemaker with a magic finger who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles works in association with private investigator emerson cod owns the pie hole and employs waitress olive snook completing the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian whom charlotte chuck is never allowed to see they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour and narrated by jim dale br br other than outlining the basics of the show i really can't praise it much more without saying just watch it despite being screwed over by the writer's guild of america strike with only 22 episodes ever to be made it provides wonderful plot twists story lines characters and situations while providing for me a satisfying ending yes i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed but i was still happy with the way it went out whether it is creative or just pretentious for a lot of people me included it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so i'm not left with just 22 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be
<START> arthur askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public his juvenile jokes silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him and he was never completely comfortable in films he has his moments in the ghost train and his character tommy gander has been tailored to make the most of his talents but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated br br askey's support in the film is not strong it includes regular co star richard murdoch betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple linden travers going over the top as a 'mad woman' also on board are peter murray hill who off screen married phyllis calvert as the nominal leading man giving a totally bland reading of the part and leading lady carol lynne who turns in an equally insipid performance it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham's brandy
