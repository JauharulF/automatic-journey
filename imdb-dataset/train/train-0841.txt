<START> well this is probably one of the best movies i've seen and i love it so much that i've memorized most of the script especially the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter the tag line holds true as well not to mention the acting is great though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper check filmography under csi if you don't know what i mean it's too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve
<START> this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch i should have expected it after seeing the first two but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of maybe they did it right this time nope not even close br br where do i begin how about with the special effects to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a raptor as it runs down a hallway even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around bad bad bad bad br br how about the acting if that's what you can call it there is one character who i suppose is supposed to be from the south however after living in the south for six years now i have never heard this way of talking perhaps he has some sort of weird disability the inability to talk normally i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one br br how about the plot it's pretty basic raptors escape people with guns must hunt them down i'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them br br other things let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better army or marine and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors split up into groups of two didn't they ever watch any horror movies or at least an episode of scooby doo in short this is one of the dumber movies out there miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie
<START> with this cast and budget you will expect more br br john cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange yet still work neither he his sister nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage br br the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that the plot goes nowhere the writing is contrived senseless and the characters paper thin if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey br br dan akroyd's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie 1991's nothing but trouble frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired
<START> 'chances are' a big mistake to see you could know director emile ardolino from 'dirty dancing' and 'sister act' and should expect something amusing from him but i guess i have to disillusion you he made a really really bad movie br br according to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby the baby grows up robert downey jr and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter mary stuart masterson complicated huh br br they fall in love with each other then appears jr former wife cybill shepherd and jr falls in love with her too i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan o'neil br br in one of his first roles robert downey jr's on his worst he copies michael j fox br br after the 'moonlighting' shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies br br anyway there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as antidote to insomnia
<START> kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsense what was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it's like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa
<START> the performance by om puri smita patil and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great br br i have not seen another movie like this it is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot you cannot not be impressed by this movie br br amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of om puri om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty's at sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning smita patil does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot br br and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble he is also the 'guru' of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble br br the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya br br a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema
<START> this movie is about a female rape victim comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty run down small town where she finds refuge in a single wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere the townspeople are mentally ill yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance db sweeney's performance was high school at best he's one of those kinda cute young actors with a sweet grin unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow to the previous commentator stating that the acting was so real well i agree actually it wasn't acting the two main characters really are pathetic weak and incapable of making mature healthy decisions in brief this movie sucks like no other rent it to laugh at it the real crime scene the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer enough to make me commit murder and lastly she's a artist writer so couldn't she afford a double wide trailer and something other than a sun yellow chevy chevette for love of god
<START> i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film i'd been devastated by the movie trantula at age seven but i was ten now the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office poor doc and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors too huge now to fit through just one it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve like diner he seemed like a sure dinner to be br br to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description but in the end better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids br br i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick trying to act brave he knew i was in trouble and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor there the red pulsating heart like hungry dude sat waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom it took months to recover br br i'm 57 years old now i've made it br br of course the blob wasn't destroyed
<START> the movie was very moving it was tender and funny at the same time the scenery was absolutely beautiful peter faulk and paul reiser gave award winning performances olympia dukakis was great i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but i did wish i could have seen more of her she is a true pro you will be able to recall experiences from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing he is a wonderful man clever eloquent and a real person it was truly an enjoyable night out this is a must see movie you will be so grateful you went
<START> if you're amused by straight faced goings on that are logical within a given illogical situation you'll enjoy this whimsical 8 minute spanish film br br a woman enters a small cafÃ© the scene looks ordinary but the counterman customers and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued br br suddenly the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song dancing across table tops with musical comedy gestures the customers at first immobile at intervals chime in badly but gamely with phrases from the song read from slips of paper in their palms on and off they jump up and dance awkwardly but earnestly in choreographed motions like backup singers br br but why the woman wonders the answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest just before the explosive climax br br even if you don't catch the song's probably ironical lyrics the situation perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle i'd love to see it again
<START> the effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business albeit a unique one all brought to a head by or perhaps the catalyst of a midlife crisis are examined in the dark and absorbing drama panic ' written and directed by henry bromell and starring william h macy and donald sutherland it's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolved br br alex macy is tired he has a loving wife martha tracey ullman a precocious six year old son sammy david dorfman a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of income the family' business he shares with his father michael sutherland and his mother deidre barbara bain but he's empty years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist dr josh parks john ritter and to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in dr parks' waiting room he meets a young woman sarah cassidy neve campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her his whole life it seems has become a situation' one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves he can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine midlife crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own he's at a crossroads and he's going to have to decide which way to go and he's going to have to do it very soon br br from a concept that is intrinsically interesting bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny with irrevocable consequences and effects when you're growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds ergo the midlife crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape it's a powerful message succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors br br for some time william h macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in magnolia ' the shoveler in mystery men' and jerry lundegaard in fargo ' and that's just a sampling of his many achievements at one point in this film sarah mentions alex's sad eyes ' and it's a very telling comment as therein lies the strength of macy's performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and uncertainty all of which have been successfully suppressed until now all the things that have always been at the core of alex's life only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing demanding confrontation and resolution it's a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable it's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate it's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around br br sutherland is extremely effective as well his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling it's frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain but a true personification of evil hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more disconcerting and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performance br br neve campbell looks the part of sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters panic ' however is one of her best efforts a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking 9 10 br br
<START> not on the same level as ring or ring 2 but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more 'spookiness' and less cheap shocks in their flicks lots of good examples in this one scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling just for a second and more worth checking out if you like the genre
<START> this is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other body stimulating fitness products if you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health freaks with a big safety pin yeahÂ the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier look alike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty i've ever seen looking through the credits her name's dianne copeland apparently and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma movie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither we're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide a k a killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific double feature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes Â and both films are pretty dumb
<START> it does seem like this film is polarizing us you either love it or hate it i loved it br br i agree with the comment s that said you just gotta feel this one br br also early in the film tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet an impressionist painter monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess but from a distance you can tell what the subject is cruise mentions that the painting has a vanilla sky i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer this movie is like that impressionist painting it's impressionist filmmaking and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting br br this is not your typical linear plot it requires more thought there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no you're not always going to be sure what's going on but at the end all is explained br br you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it after it ends is when you should think about it if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding you will overwhelm yourself just let it happen go with it keep an open mind remember what you see and save the analysis for later br br i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique wildly creative and spellbinding br br but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it it appeals to a certain taste if you like existential psychedelic philosophical thought provoking challenging spiritual movies then see it if you prefer something a little lighter then skip it br br but if you do like what i described then you will surely enjoy it
<START> not only does the film's author steven greenstreet obviously idolize michael moore but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of moore's propaganda film making tactics moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though while greenstreet is obviously less skilled here br br having been privy to all of the issues surrounding moore's speech at uvsc i was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community that moore was being paid 40 000 of the state of utah 's educational funds to basically promote john kerry's campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie were pushed to the background by greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalized br br the marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable promoting the film by claiming that mormon's tried to kill moore not only is this preposterous but it defames a major religion that greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with i followed moore's visit very closely and all of the major news agencies noted that moore's visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in utah br br greenstreet has banked on this film to jump start his film making career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this this seems to have been a severe miscalculation though since moore's visits to roughly 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event greenstreet's assumption that american audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesn't seem to be well founded br br even the name of the film this divided state is somewhat of a misnomer since utah voted overwhelmingly for bush's re election and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other state the division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in greenstreet's ideological differences with his religion and state if anything i find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and woody allen's hilarious contention in sleeper 1973 that i was beaten up by quakers
<START> there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning and there is also emotion in the inner workings of mathieu's family dealing w his mother's problems and how that comes to bear on their relationship but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered unless i'm just too dumb to pick up on them why is mathieu in a mental hospital what led to the boys' break up and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills or some male nudity but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying
<START> needless remake and it can't come close to capturing the charm of the original the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts this version is ridiculously politically correct the film lacks style and mostly it lacks talent not just with the acting but the direction sets costumes etc are all below par it has a blatant disregard for period detail vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair tyne daly isn't too bad they should have left well enough alone the singing ranges good vanessa williams to poor everyone else watch the original 1963 version and skip this one there is not much here to recommend
<START> like i said at the top four stars just aren't enough it's one of the best films i've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that don't really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span br br even if i haven't seen all his films yet i'd have to say that this is spielberg at his peak it's pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple don't come along too often 'cause i think all of us are in desperate need of first class motion picture entertainment in these hard times br br movies like this are more than just movies they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more br br the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasn't even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that year br br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people br br if only movies were still this good
<START> so it's really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck
<START> for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue fortunately the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life style which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i concede that this comment may betray naivetÃ© on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin english they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine
