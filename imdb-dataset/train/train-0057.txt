<START> i grew up on the 'superman ii' theatrical version s2t and as a kid i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman type villains it started off with a bang Â the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen as in part i now as an adult i can see how the mighty had fallen with s2t see my review i've always heard of the back story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director richard donner from part ii it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now it's common 'back to the future' and 'matrix' 2 3 for example unfortunately after finally seeing the richard donner cut or s2rd i still can't fully recommend it gone was the great superman change scene the entire paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part i in s2t's opening in fact they all but wrote the words previously on supermanÂ in s2rd the special effects weren't great in either part i or s2t but s2rd they were mostly downright laughable Â such as lois falling from the daily planet window i will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite overall if you grew up on s2t as i did and loved it as a child Â not nitpicking as i do as an adult you should absolutely see s2rd as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes spoiler alert unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s2t replaced with the exact same ending as 'i ' this is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesn't make sense on why clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened and will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation
<START> st elmo's fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on set br br i actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released br br don't make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films it really is that offensive to the genre
<START> end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled like tentacles 77 a good cast does not mean it'll be a good film the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on the rest of the cast is shown briefly like lew ayres dean jagger and macdonald carey as a security guard i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re animater and dolls i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer john carridine and dean jagger well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it lucky them if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards alligator 80 and game of death 79 sue lyon lolita is also in the movie minus her lollipop if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie 1 out of 10
<START> to put it simply i am not fond of westerns and having never sat through one from beginning to end i decided to watch my darling clementine and see it all the way through no matter how painful it was for me at first it was excruciating as expected i found the acting to be laughable the scenery your standard dessert horses and cowboys boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful however after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure focusing in on the cinematography and how john ford managed to make even the dullest situations dull according to me that is look quite stunning at times made it a lot more interesting br br in conclusion i can't go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end and that in itself impresses me
<START> to all of yall who think 1 this was a boring telecast 2 halle berry and denzel washington did not deserve their oscars br br shut the f k up this was one of the best academy awards show because 1 it was a moment in history to have a black yes black actress win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years to be honest i had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees to me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg alfre woodard whoopi goldberg diana ross mary jean babtise but it did not 2 halle berry deserved that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows as for mr washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for malcomx to all of you who think race is not an issue probably white people in the movie industry well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence angela basset i do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it
<START> recently i was looking for the newly issued wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of grey owl the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention he responsible for such fine films as gandhi chaplin and shadowlands i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson author of shadowlands this special edition was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under 10 00 so i chanced it bought it wow what a beautiful film pierce brosnan stars as archie grey owl a real life trapper in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada and worked to help protect them brosnan who starred in a james bond film gives a shaded warm powerful performance as does annie galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land especially the beaver a fine score by george fenton the crucible and beautiful photograhy by roger pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film and the extras on this dvd are something else includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake eberts 2 featurettes and many other fine additions plus options for those having access to a pc with dvd rom features grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that isn't loaded with a lot of violence and sex this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion and a whole new love and understanding for beavers grey owl is a very fine film worth checking out this is one i look forward to sharing with others
<START> artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you can't paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable br br the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just can't stop thinking of men and their bodiesÂ for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a man hungry person also it's quite funny when she's insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she sees br br actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasn't too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p
<START> this is the best dub i've ever heard by disney as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack themes characters dialogues in kiki delivery service urrrghhh br br this one has different atmosphere especially the deviation from the common heroine this one has both hero and heroine although i don't really endorse the use of hero heroine here since miyazaki is out from the stereotype common theme as usual after being introduced by spirited away amazed by mononoke troubled by grave of fireflies and deeply touched by majo no takkyuubin this one start with a bit doubt in my part wondering if this will be the first ghibi's dud well in the end just like only yesterday and whisper of the heart i ended up giving 10 rating i'd give 9 8 rating but the additional 0 2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie br br spoiler somehow i see this as a sad movie people die in this one the lonely robot the abandoned place and it ends with destruction it is as if mankind really can't live with too much power the collapsing scene gave me patches of metropolis ending it's just sad somehow the plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well as always joe hisaishi really belongs to uematsu kanno williams caliber people who can brings a movie a game an event to life even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition br br this is a feel good movie that used to be part of us cinema in the classic days it's a wonderful life etc etc well things change
<START> this is just about in the same league as the black cat' although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9 that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing br br the invisible ray' is part horror part drama and certainly part sci fi for a movie made in 1936 the sci fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time the mixture of horror drama and sci fi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better br br director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood it's a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre br br as with the black cat' and island of lost souls' i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling br br anyway watch this film if you get the chance when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library
<START> i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time and it was even more boring than when i first watched it i don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull the opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut the makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open there's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening there isn't much gore at least in the vipco dvd i watched br br no the incredible melting man is not that great at all i'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it if you want a true sci fi horror cult classic watch the deadly spawn instead
<START> i'll give writer director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill conceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for late night zoned out viewing only you have been warned
<START> ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special it is caratherisic for serbia and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well so i think the rest of audience for example in europe can't enjoy it so much because the subtitles ruin the hole thing but they should at least try yes it is ironic this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it if you have got a chance to see this one don't blew up ok
<START> igor and the lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie apparently even nearly twenty years later charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash filmmakers this is a typical troma production meaning in other words there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display Â which isn't bad Â but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at igor and the lunatics is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul one of paul's lower ranked disciples named igor becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch hiker girl there's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete for no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds
<START> investigative reporter darren mcgavin as carl kolchak is back this time he's after the night strangler once again police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve or want to cover up the supernatural angle producer director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding night with understandably less success br br mr curtis assembles a fun supporting cast included are dark shadows alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis jo ann pflug as louise harper heads up a sexy collection of belly dancers and although i've never seen it mentioned anywhere that must be roger davis as mr mcgavin's dining companion in an early scene feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires br br the night strangler 1 16 73 dan curtis darren mcgavin jo ann pflug simon oakland wally cox
<START> i saw this for gary busey and fred williamson thinking they were buddy cops they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie though every scene he's in is awesome especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo br br what's incredible about this movie is the plot in the movie fred williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators at one point i think thats its busey but it turns out i'm only partly right busey is not the killer but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone why i don't know in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess
<START> a famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life there he comes in dutch with the local church choir that will change his life br br i had no expectations when i saw this movie for the first time yesterday i like watching foreign movies that are not english and i've already seen a couple of swedish movies in my life but this one was the best so far br br where to start in my opinion this film is a jewel thanks to many things of which one is the outstanding acting michael nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful almost shy and devoted conductor daniel darÃ©us beautiful frida hallgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting the choir members are all well developed interesting characters with their own story each br br this movie tells a story a beautiful story about music love pain memories death about a man who devoted his life to music and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then kay pollack shows us that the swedish are outstanding movie creators go see sÃ¥ som i himmelen it's a movie that makes you think about life and love and that's also comforting in some way
<START> this is one of those horror flicks where twenty somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire getting into a heap of trouble for doing so a portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the kelippoth of the sitra achra by a man whose daughter summer gets kidnapped by something taken into it summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters this is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny anyway three wannabee witches who went to high school together renea the most enthusiastic serious practitioner in the dark arts and her lesbian cohorts jasmine and marlene it's more or less a passing fad with them though join up with buddies jason and ricky on a trip in the wilderness where summer vanished from her home ten years ago opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book a demon is set free as is summer now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world br br low budget contains a loopy but ambitious story restraining it into a confined setting these young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast as can be the case in these movies the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass while befriending jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time the action is shot mostly in the dark making any violence hard to decipher brigitte kingsley and the rest of the female cast for that matter is some mighty nice eye candy dressed scantily clad as a female conan a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie some lesbianism some kissing and fondling and nudity spice things up nicely and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot it's so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material br br might be of interest for co starring world wrestling entertainment's captain courageous christian real name jason reso as one of the group spoofing his alter ego as a chicken quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig landy cannon is likable as unlikely hero jason a lovestruck naive young man whose ex fiancÃ© jasmine vanessa james is now bi sexual and in love with marlene jasmine's cruelty is in toying with jason's feelings by hiding her affair with marlene from his knowledge while ricky and renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out never to ignite again the kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit i guess to refrain from showing how ludicrous laughable it looks if presented in full the lesbian antics of jasmine and marlene haley shannon is mostly tame their love making once alone in the woods up against a tree is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night my rating is a bit favorable towards it almost solely because of kingsley for purely superficial reasons rather than the plot or film making the movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys and girls who love hot women i think though for the most part the humor falls a bit flat
<START> myron breckinridge rex reed gets a sex change from a doctor john carradine dead drunk and comes out as myra raquel welch she then decides to destroy male masculinity or something like that and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous john huston don't ask and break up a young happy couple young handsome hunky roger herren and farrah fawcett yes the farrah fawcett br br they took a great novel by gore vidal that was unfilmable and naturally tried to film it they also hired an english guy with a decidedly anti american attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable talent welch reed and embarassed old professionals huston carradine andy devine jim backus mae west threw it all together and surprise an absolute disaster br br the film got an x rating at its release it's been lowered to an r mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which welch sodomizes rusty roger herren and a scene in which welch attempts to have sex with fawcett br br the movie is very scattershot scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense it's not good at all but i was never bored br br acting varies wildly reed is horrible really sad huston chews the scenery again and again and again to a nauseating extreme welch is actually not bad as myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her west is hardly in the movie a blessing and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes roger herren whatever happened to was very young handsome and not bad as rusty fawcett is ok br br it's hard to find things to say about this you just watch it in disbelief a must see movie to believe
<START> and you get chori chori chupke chupke don't get me wrong this movie is much less explicit or not even than pretty woman but it was a new topic for bollywood the topic was accepted but it is far from jism murder and julie to tell you the truth the topic is presented in a very clean manner but the plot has it's number of clichÃ©s the beginning of the movie is presented in a very filmi way there are some very little plot holes the movie picks up once rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning the acting couldn't have been any better salman khan sometimes impresses and sometimes lets you down over here he gave one of the best performances on top of that his role is written so well that you applaud every time he solves a problem rani mukherjee was adequate throughout the movie you feel for her character the most but she is overshadowed by preity zinta preity zinta is picture perfect out of the three she gives everyone a run for their money its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent and trust me madhubala is far from your girl next door this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high the supporting cast are like the family you see in hahk where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here the songs are pretty nice the title song is my favorite of them all along with dil tera mera dil hearts mehndi mehndi henna and dekhne walon ne look at the world's sight are two song that fit the film perfectly preity's cabaret number diwani diwani crazy could've been shortened while no 1 punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch
<START> i grew up b 1965 watching and loving the thunderbirds all my mates at school watched we played thunderbirds before school during lunch and after school we all wanted to be virgil or scott no one wanted to be alan counting down from 5 became an art form i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child how bitterly disappointing the only high point was the snappy theme tune not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds thankfully early saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series gerry anderson and his wife created jonatha frakes should hand in his directors chair his version was completely hopeless a waste of film utter rubbish a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with homo sapiens subsp sapiens was a huge error of judgment
