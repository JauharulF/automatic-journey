<START> bell book and candle was shown recently on cable not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy based on the james van druten's broadway hit which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash the film was directed by richard quine who turned the play into a delightful comedy br br evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on vertigo released the same year movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released in fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women br br the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing as the witch that becomes human her gillian is charming james stewart who plays the publisher shep' henderson is also seen at his best mr stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top br br in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester playing queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here jack lemmon's nicky holroyd the brother of gillian is also good ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch br br this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching bell book and candle
<START> plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting nevertheless br br development is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed nothing shocking too much nothing overexciting movie sitcom style br br i liked woody excellent performance had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows
<START> this one grew on me i love the r d burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re watching the movie the brother sister plot line is powerful i thought there's also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc that are just distracting though not unfunny from a certain point of view also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it br br like many of the bollywood movies i've seen this one is melodramatic and opera like including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re connect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugs br br a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to india from an indian point of view that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in india living only for the pleasures of the moment the hippie singing dancing drugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone i'm old enough to remember and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned out kids are actual hippie extras as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood br br it is not about the actual hare krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a krishna rama chant as do a group of actual indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie br br virginia
<START> whoa nelly i've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing man was he right on the nose this movie was acted by pure amateurs they had to have done one take maybe two on each scene the movie seemed soooo rushed the script was also poor they had lines that tried to be unique but failed miserably get your meathooks off of me oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it happens all the time with comedies but with a horror movie and with below average actors the results are incredibly pathetic the lines and scenarios were all very predictable but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was again the damn acting it was awful besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth i thought he was great br br the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh t tourist who are on a vacation in asia they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex slaughterhouse sounds like a cool story but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing there wasn't a trace of suspense br br i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this but unfortunately with a huge capital u the movie was incredibly disappointing i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects the flabby chicks were also so so br br everything about this movie screams amateur this is ryan nicholson's first feature length and for the most part he failed there's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror i pray his next movie doesn't play out like another b horror flick unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be even after this disappointment i'm willing to give ryan another shot from what i've seen of him he's a true dedicated man to the genre good luck next time because this was bad news
<START> a very good movie a classic sci fi film with humor action and everything this movie offers a greater number of aliens we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces the emperor is somewhat an original character i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese excellent references i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi wan it gives a sadness and a tear the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi wan yoda and his father 1997 version not hayden christenssen the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending i felt there was much more than meets the eye and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe
<START> i liked this movie it was pretty cool it has it all cars gun shooting fighting and even a token girl it does not excel in any of this things with the exception of the cars a bit of shooting a bit of fighting a bit of smooching around and lotÂ´s of car with a great chase near the end the jump you may say is impractical but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible so the movie ainÂ´t as bad as people are painting it it has some quality and i liked to watch it in fact i loved the film and i didnÂ´t need to turn off my brains to watch it i wasnÂ´t always thinking is this possible or tramp like that 9 in 10
<START> i honestly don't understand how tripe like this gets made the worst junior high talent show skit you've ever seen is more entertaining than this film will ferrell's wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible
<START> i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2 00 a m so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon h b o where this classic was playing initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting but certainly not worth watching basically if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound but even that can get annoying
<START> i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time i got into the series very late season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr digital video recorder box while i was house sitting for the weekend it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer and boy was i hooked i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i've ever spent i watched the first three seasons in three weeks that's 72 forty minute episodes i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america the dvr is set and you can bet i'll be chomping at the bit
<START> brokedown palace is truly a one of a kind it's an amazing story showing two girl's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about br br alice morano claire danes and darlene davis kate beckinsale are two best friends strait out of high school they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand and are immediately captivated by a young man nick parks he flirts with them both and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend br br when the two arrive at the airport they are immediately searched for drugs someone tipped off customs and in an instant their life is changed forever in the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life they learn about a highly respected lawyer named hank green bill pullman br br an american who knows the thai justice system he fights for the girl to be free but they soon find out when they leave or go is all up to them br br if you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years brokedown palace is definitely the way to go
<START> then they will have a proper place to file this crap sorry not a mystery as claimed it is religious mumbo jumbo i kept waiting for the unimaginable evil that was promised me but the evil in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities br br i can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future i'm also a little cheesed off that i now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as i'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too br br it's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 etc will get their reviews posted first this could lead to more people getting tricked as i was into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching br br well it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror supernatural film
<START> the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten savagely spun around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle really sick and nasty scene the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans
<START> a serious comedy ross hunter produced movie version of the french play les joies de la famille later americanized as a very rich woman is plush well cast occasionally funny and unfortunately timeless a wealthy california widow who appears to be frittering away her money is railroaded by her two grown greedy daughters both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance the whole issue of a vital but aged woman sent to a rest home against her will and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing is touchy material for a comedy and to his credit director david lowell rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time that the seriousness of rosie 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending the picture leaves you smiling and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky from
<START> prior to this film i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man child peter bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh br br the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and oh so boring when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note br br the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega gory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if you've already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre
<START> this is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning it will give you that warm fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face br br sure we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories but it does do the trick entertain br br being from sweden and living in the us for quite sometime it is funny how we react the deadbeat husband is going to kill him she gabriella is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger than life ending we know how these things work everything comes together at the end and it did the characters were somewhat simple they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it nothing was really left for your own imagination the closest would probably be siv she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with daniel but that's about it br br but the movie is beautiful set in rural norrland the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable michael nyqvist is truly genius with his crazy unique look and frida hallberg is charming and approachable maybe a little too nice br br but most of all this movie makes you feel and that is the most important thing you cry you laugh you hate and you identify i don't know about you guys but that does not happen that often
<START> this one minute film is arguably the first movie ever made other inventors had previously filmed actions like edison's motion photography of a sneeze but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium at the time of course their cinematograph' must have bewildered their peers including their subjects in this first instance the brothers record employees leaving their factory some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera the lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle but la sortie des usines lumiere' doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films the most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today br br rating 8
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than husbands beware all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine mcintyre dee green doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders lu leonard maxine gates and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called brideless groom and i recommend both
<START> americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fast br br i found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule and guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelings br br surprisingly when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging br br i just don't usually watch that much late night tv so i can't recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life
<START> i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremes br br it is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish br br a blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs br br
<START> dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action slap stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions it's hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode a must see movie for anyone who likes anime
