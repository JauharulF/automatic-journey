<START> if this guy can make a movie then i sure as hell can make one too br br in fact if you hire me to make a movie for you i promise to do the following br br 1 i will add more naked women this movie had none i think cheesy b class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body i wouldn't want to let my viewers down br br 2 i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes and considering the movie was only like an hour long the dream to movie length ratio was quite high and if i do decide to do a dream sequence i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on i mean who sleeps in leather pants br br 3 i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine br br 4 and finally i will not mix modern technology with the undead i mean a palm pilot can only be so scary at least they turned it into an evil rolly polly monster before the screen blew up or something br br so if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me wanna b movie director extraordinaire
<START> fred astaire and ginger rogers hollywood's premiere dance team were usually dressed to the nines and gliding through elaborately exaggerated art deco sets in the 1930's however they go a bit more downscale for this 1936 outing the fifth of their ten musicals together this time astaire foregoes his top hat white tie and tails to become a bubblegum chewing sailor named bake baker and rogers plays dance hall entertainer sherry martin who was bake's partner dancing and otherwise before he enlisted consequently unlike the mistaken identity ploys and romantic hesitancies prevalent in most of their previous pairings they are already a couple from the film's outset br br directed by mark sandrich who guided five of their pairings the film bears a narrative similarity to 1935's roberta in which they are but one of two couples featured in the storyline in fact randolph scott plays the other male lead in both films this time as bake's womanizing crewmate bilge smith he is partnered with not irene dunne who understandably turned down this follow up but harriet hilliard just married to ozzie nelson in real life and decades before ozzie harriet hilliard plays sherry's spinsterish sister connie who falls hard for bilge in the silly plot she is given a makeover by a young bleached blonde lucille ball and there is s classic three way shot of hilliard ball and a kewpie doll adorable betty grable in front of a mirror br br speaking of the story what there is of one is credited to allan scott and dwight taylor and goes something like this bake and bilge are on shore leave in san francisco where they end up in a dance hall with their rowdy shipmates bake finds sherry working there while bilge runs into connie first when she comes in as a dowdy spinster and then showing up as a glamour girl romance blooms for both couples connie and sherry inherit a steamer from their father but they need money to keep it afloat multiple misunderstandings occur in both relationships but it all works out when they turn the steamer into a theater and put on a fundraising musical revue it's about as silly as it sounds but it does provide a good excuse for some memorable irving berlin tunes and a trio of astaire rogers dances br br the first two are casual in tone a dance contest set to the percolating let yourself go where they show off mercilessly to win and a physical shipboard comedy routine set to the toe tapping i'm putting all my eggs in one basket however their last dance is a classic return to formality with a melodramatic piece beautifully set to a stunning arrangement of let's face the music and dance intriguingly this movie contains not only an astaire dance solo but the only time rogers ever had a dance solo to herself in one of their movies an energetic tap routine again set to let yourself go dressed in a creamy satin sailor outfit she also sings the same song most winningly near the beginning of the film br br acting wise astaire and rogers are in typically zesty comic form here while scott plays his role with his trademark cock eyed virility hilliard is an extremely dull presence and as a former band singer she performs two berlin love songs in a frustratingly diffident manner regardless the magic generated by astaire and rogers in their prime make this essential viewing the 2005 dvd has several good extras beginning with a thirteen minute featurette follow the fleet the origins of those dancing feet about how astaire and rogers started to work together there is also a live action soundie called melody master jimmie lunceford and his dance orchestra a poultry themed cartoon called let it be me and the original theatrical trailer
<START> oh my god i bought this movie and i watched the whole thing okay it's going to be alright i'l know i'll be okay in a month or two some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs i was going to eat something after the movie but i just can't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment bad yes bad very bad bad bad bad bad bad wait bad doesn't seem to get the message across in quite the right way hmm there isn't a word to describe just how awful not awful hmm disgustingly horribly casted acted filmed directed written now i don't know what to do but throw it out possibly burn it i wouldn't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now the worst movie ever since hey happy
<START> spoilers spoilers released in 1956 and considered quite racy at the time douglas sirk's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle who is insecure weak wounded very alcoholic played by robert stack in a very touching vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone ms malone's performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for rock hudson and jealousy for lauren bacall malone is the only actress i've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first now don't get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950's but it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as malone is she's not a very good actress and she's not capable of subtly or shading her performace is of one note she does get to do a wicked mambo and in a great montage as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses stack who should have won an oscar malone who won the award but shouldn't have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the hysteria both sexual otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film hudson bacall fade to grey brown which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of stack's and the stalked love interest of malone's who moans groans over rock through most of the film but hudson wants no part of her and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack no one is very happy no one is happy for very long the stack bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and can't give bacall a baby to prove that he's a man sirk who was a very intelligent man and had a long fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950's with a series of intense vividly colored women's movies or melodramas although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material in sirk's hands they became masterpieces of the genre sirk had a wonderful sense of color design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations lighting make believe shadows and lots of mirroed reflections in written the characters are always peeking out of windows listening at doors or sneaking around so in the end after much violence an accidental murder a miscarriage more sirk ends the movie with a final startling scene of a reborn and reformed malone in a man tailored suit sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell
<START> this is a sublime piece of film making it flows at just the right pace throughout the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film br br however despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven't experienced for a long time that is to say it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as sex violence and unnecessary special effects br br 'dan in real life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices it has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require and indeed would be ruined by any further embellishment at the same time the theme is entirely adult it's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers br br there are some scenes that feel a bit 'waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium like stability the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill br br i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy put aside any prejudices because this is a must see
<START> i love this show as it action packed with adventure love and intrigue well some times love it's so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect it's also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role as i have only seen him in mary poppins the mixture of the main characters mark amanda jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience this is a show you have to watch
<START> what a poor excuse for new zealnd movie making i'm ashamed to call myself a new zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv aug 2006 the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars the ship in real life is one of the inter island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo a dolphin still all over the set including on the ship's funnel the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship ferry between the usa and mexico it has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage one of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of new zealand's south island in the background for god's sake must have been a very cold time on the usa mexico area the story is weak the acting is weaker and the new zealand american accents just don't work i expect the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production i know high school kids in new zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones goof there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck presumably to make it look like it was american but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it i'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way
<START> i am not a very good writer so i'll keep this short world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen i've seen different wwii documentaries not only english north american and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why how hitler got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and objective fair to everyone it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations it has a lot of original footage including color footage and many eye witnesses it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive it has great music and narrator all in all i gave this one 10 10 because it's that good i haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those
<START> musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer this time harriet hilliard br br randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner but now the two are on shore leave fred and ginger take up right where they left off and randy accidentally meets ginger's dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty but randy's a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor br br again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to but the real hit of the show is let's face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair let's face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen their dancing on this one is absolute magic br br i'm sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson that's right ozzie and harriet it's something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky's mom on television then again she didn't even keep her own name br br neither ozzie or harriet sang on television ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here but where are you both with real feeling and class i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today
<START> this was the worst mtv movie awards ever i barely laughed none of the presenters were funny the hosts really sucked and the parodies weren't so great either why can't we go back to the good olden days when the show was a riot
<START> for me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria form function and meaning guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms nice shots and sometimes interesting acting the long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz an introvert person suggests to have depth but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say this film acts like an introvert person if you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide and the unanswered question why that changes anna's view on life and makes her suspicious 'why don't you speak to me ' asks sebastiaan anna doesn't answer she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word what is the function of that shot what does it mean my question is like sebastiaans what has this film to say what is meant by this movie the answer for me it shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water the story of their lives is simple and boring motives behind their actions are not shown the rest is skins residences landscapes nice and artistic done but meaningless without having disposal of 'instructions for use' in my opinion this film is made for fellow artists not for the common viewer
<START> i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of br br i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger martin sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did
<START> don't read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it and you'll have a really great experience if you like to see an intelligent twisted story go get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed cypher is not really a sci fi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business it's about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness cypher is much deeper more complex and what belongs the story and the ending also much much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies cube and nothing actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well made flick sorry can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience just give it a chance
<START> the reason the dvd releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film a modest sea story at best br br distributed for television thru allied artists dvd's or vhs on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16mm television print films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b w prints because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway striking b w prints for television was also cheaper as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis
<START> i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies it is filled with super surfer greg noll's home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50 year passion nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory it is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic surfers are not astronauts nor test pilots nor are they surgeons perhaps or ph d's again perhaps it believes in the quest of the surfer it believes in the beauty of human goofiness it believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before it celebrates the down time of a country which fought a cold war instead of a hot war with the russian socialists surfing is the ultimate narcissism it is dangerous but only slightly historical i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received this movie has no military heroes it has no guns the only beach head surfers conquer has a beer stand and and a surfboard shop this is not a problem peace is not desperate it is the joy of exhalation
<START> it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if any without his presence br br despite a not outstanding direction in fact there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly a seemingly low budget a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end br br i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance even paul scofield acting in a man for all seasons br br actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime br br je suis maurice morand prÃ¨tre catholique i am maurice morand a catholic priest is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end br br the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christÂ´s blood br br gÃ©rard the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself has to drink it if he doesnÂ´t want to leave it in the cabaret he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine br br in next scene the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable do you carry away men too asks morand who hates himself for what he has just done that would be too much work is the smart answer br br the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time br br i think that le dÃ©froquÃ© is a very strange film but has to be seen by all viewers if the are good catholiques it is mandatory because it is a very rare jewell in film history br br
<START> i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out i was thinking how dumb is disney getting i was wrong i found it to be very good i mean it's not the lion king but it's cool to see another side from a certain point it was very funny also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like the lion king animation the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return it was a very good movie over all
<START> saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gob smacked and flabbergasted the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting all of the character were so authentic to me i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom go and see it you'll cry your heart out but you'll experience a wonderful catharsis besides it teaches you one important lesson determination is everything you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self pity it won't get you anywhere and the only person who'll pity you will be yourself
<START> this is my first comment this is a fantastic movie i watched it all by luck one night on tv at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was br br i suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad b movie how wrong superficial critiques br br i think that the movie is almost a product of genius the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
<START> not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the eyeball at the tail end of asinine fake slapping and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever i wouldn't considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devil's experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worst well really stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forward br br two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 people who seek out f'd up films just to see how f'd up it really is or 2 horror completest i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldn't float my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust as in would you just kill the b tch already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide get traces of death sure that sucks too but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect br br the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they're supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for it's notoriety no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking
