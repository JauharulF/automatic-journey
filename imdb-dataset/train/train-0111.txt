<START> i highly recommend this film set in the bladerunner esquire future of 2054 paris it is in most respect a classic film noir script lady in peril sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone luckily it avoids being stereotypical and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting innovative visuals the film might remind you of sin city in look but it has an even sharper even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling each frame each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer in terms of story and artwork you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer and movies like casablanca as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations make any excuse you need to see this film
<START> one of hung's better early efforts the humor is dead on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan's drunken master the action is also pretty good especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end it's not the greatest film but pretty good for '70's kung fu especially if you're a fan of hung and or lee be warned though most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive br br sammo hung is a rural swine herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys sammo turns on his dead on bruce lee impersonation when fighting br br this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's enter the dragon but it's not exactly that sammo is a rural swine herder obsessed with bruce lee who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open air restaurant once situated at the new job he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money when sammo switches into fighting mode he switches on his bruce lee impersonation which must be seen to be believed this film is pretty sloppy in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy and preposterous makeup but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy highly recommended for a good mood
<START> going down as the most expensive film in finnish history to date dark floors is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of floors ironically enough in an abandoned hospital in which our protagonists are trapped lead by an autistic daughter and her father himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses accompanied by a security guard a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned but they are not alone directed by finnish born pete riski more known for his television work dark floors is filmed in english using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland's arguably most famous group lordi 2006 eurovision song contest winners as themselves i e in their on stage monstrous costumes as the films antagonists yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most in convincing the audience br br any film that has their lead character use the phrase it's too quiet is already headed down a dubious path and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clichÃ©s alongside and worst of all anything that is interestingly original isn't fleshed out enough for it to resonate the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire however there isn't enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black but i don't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening also the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch a concept not often used in the horror genre but the characters don't confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste as if the director and or mr lordi who had many of the ideas used within the film had these thoughts but couldn't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point br br yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for too much is clichÃ©d too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest accompanying the couple we have the traditional token black man as a hard nosed security guard with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself worst of all though unfortunately is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits but not for them appearing as themselves what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear the shining is scary because it's a member of your own family hounding you in dawn of the dead it's our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess in alien the fear is explained the creature is rationalised and in dark floors there is none of that perhaps it's unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it's aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear without a build up of any atmosphere lordi just aren't scary br br it's infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as hollywood churns out much in the similar way that george a romero started out but it doesn't always materialise i enjoyed the film and didn't feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously emotionally or critically i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point but it fades out into nothingness why did it happen what does it mean will they go through this all again without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under who knows and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care dark floors is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas it's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation
<START> as winter approaches our state owned broadcaster the abc has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights this commenced with a twelve year old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels persuasion northanger abbey and mansfield park are to come br br the curious thing about this production by a e television networks with script by the ever reliable andrew davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring gwyneth paltrow and clueless a modernized version starring alicia silverstone which transported the plot to beverly hills perhaps as a result even with kate beckinsale in the lead this production sank without trace br br as a general rule much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is brideshead revisited which had 13 50 minute episodes back in 1982 you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of pride and prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six part tv mini series it's not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film atonement is a recent example but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm br br given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters Â knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p p samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly Â sybil fawlty on speed bernard hepton as emma's feeble father was also excellent we saw the damp countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody br br even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places Â some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the formalities of the times i'd have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots br br if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and compares well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come
<START> i never quite understood the popularity of saban's power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of japan's ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects etc br br of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect br br i'm sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american version br br power rangers is completely awful try super sentai instead looking for a better show try voltron the third dimension instead
<START> not too keen on this really the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing i enjoyed the first 10 minutes bill nunns good after that it was pretty appalling tim doesn't fit the role he comes across as a smug self inflated ass pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player it's a idealist film and as a musician feel slightly offended after watching it there's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates he's completely self indulgent i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character maybe i'm watching the wrong film if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle
<START> this debuted today on the scifi channel and all i can say is i am speechless i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work i had high hopes now i am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway this movie sucks there i said it they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do my nine year old niece could make a better film the only decent thing about this film is the sound and or sound track oh i just found a rusty c clamp in my old tool box i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again christmas is coming buy this movie and give it to people you hate mike
<START> i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasn't an option this movie sucks the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadn't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous it's not just a race thing it's also a gender the combination of the two things is ridiculous i am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors actresses but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be 'entertaining' to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great movie that's all i have to say about that
<START> this is the kind of film one watches in gape jawed horrified silence and yet continues to watch mesmerized as if watching a train wreck in slow motion and yet in the back of your mind thoughts are churning who on earth green lighted this garbage br br some of the preceding user comments say things like a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy an insult to children everywhere that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond so what one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series rocky and bullwinkle avengers flipper mod squad ad nauseam would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be recreated the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this br br as for f murray abraham a fine actor of stage and screen well all i can say is he must have been in trouble with the irs br br run don't walk away from the television if this trash comes on
<START> i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident well it must of been blonde women being stalked the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing hiding he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do br br the old mirror in the bathroom is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago you had the cop on the trail of the villain another clichÃ© played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent he's from london the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of clichÃ©'s and make's scary move which was a comedy look scary pathetic
<START> i really thought they did an excellent job there was nothing wrong with it at all i don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears i guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me it was sooo good i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own trials are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma
<START> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
<START> my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show both the early episodes on the n and the later ones on abc family and they love it i wasn't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season i'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes i've seen them described as highly publicized and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes personally i don't see a whole lot of difference the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout but they do lose some great people along the way my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this i also wish they'd done some self referential humor about the changes like on boy meets world where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so and when a different actor later shows up playing her they ask her where she's been and she says upstairs or when early series token geek minkus shows up for the high school graduation they ask him where he's been and he says over there pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera before saying hey mr turner wait up and running off screen mr turner being another character who left oh well maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something i was just glad to see aunt hilda show up for the finale she was always one of my favorites it's too bad it couldn't have been a more encompassing cast reunion the zelda candle just didn't cut it for me
<START> if you've ever seen the trailer for the film the recruit with colin farrell and al pacino you'll never have to see that film sadly renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers br br the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher the setting is a futuristic paris and science fiction elements feature throughout the special thing about renaissance though is its visual style and not its story renaissance is 3d computer animation like final fantasy but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts the result looks stunning although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome slightly robotic movements slightly wooden facial acting etc as a highly stylised beautiful film noir renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience especially visually the story and writing though are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals it's not a bad story and presumably if you haven't seen the trailer it's a lot more exciting than it was for me but it is a story that isn't highly original and verges on the corny a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny making the writing sound like a beginner's first efforts br br i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends it's unlike anything i've seen before visually and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience it is also a watchable story even if it isn't perfect
<START> the perfectly stupid weapon i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segal's movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie the plot is predictable the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene
<START> i'm not usually given to hyperbole but after seeing over two decades worth of academy awards i can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction total cruelty and sheer stupidity that i've ever had the misfortune to witness i'm not talking about the awards themselves as usual there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won who lost and who never even got nominated but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be what is terribly unfair is the treatment both the stars and non stars received at the hands of cates and horvitz in the name of reducing boredom br br it is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn't al pacino has been played off at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying how he was saying it and what the emotion was behind the statement it demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect however to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read to make them slink away quietly when they lose to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience all of those things were done to the non stars never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience br br the stars didn't fare much better it's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of hilary swank and clint eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches chris rock as host was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the academy had hoped nor nearly as funny as he could be his opening remarks were almost but not quite as offensive as sean penn made them out to be and his comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting of course he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has in the end chris rock was something he's almost never been before a non entity br br even the musical numbers were handled poorly beyonce sang well but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs another example of utter disrespect for an artist was giving jorge drexler's nominated song to antonio banderas even though drexler was present and clearly wouldn't have minded singing his own song based on his winning speech br br the efforts of cates and horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree but what resulted was a show devoid of life we've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know about the overblown production about the self congratulatory quality but this is their night not ours what is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated cates and horvitz should frankly be ashamed
<START> you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye br br overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over it's a thumper br br it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lot br br other factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant 8 out of 10 more like a 7 5 but that's pretty good
<START> this movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet i like barney more than this movie the graphics suck half the movie is animated the deaths suck and over all i was ready to sue the people that made this movie please do not waste hours of your life watching this movie the only good part was when the movie ended this movie is 50 percent jurassic park 1 percent sabretooth and 49 9 percent dumb please do not waste your time watching this movie you will regret it you want to know why this movie sucks well the cover sucked the graphics sucked the blood looked i mean is ketchup the people tried to blow themselves up the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal i mean there was a 5 ft tiger running straight at a woman she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away wait till you can actually hit it the acting was horrible too jurrasic park is actually a good movie and this just had to go and ruin it
<START> it's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star prior to watching the wicker man i had considered aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars in all fairness the wicker man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it br br there is a cheap trick all too often used in hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful it is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers even more so in that the carefully crafted or however they put it conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot which naturally i can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point br br it is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths pedophiles and possibly die hard nicholas cage fans but only to a few of the mainstream audience if you really want something along these lines i heartily recommend m night shyamalan's the village instead lacking some kind of memory erasing pill i suppose i need to watch something better to force it from my mind say attack of the killer tomatoes or pee wee's big adventure
<START> this film has renewed my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie
