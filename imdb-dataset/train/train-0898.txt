<START> i don't understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made br br cartoon characters abound sue's foul mouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for sue's asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are i've no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film br br i didn't like the film at all
<START> all i can say is if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie then you're not human even after watching it for the first time i was hooked it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe as i'm sure other fans will attest to after watching it you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us at least we have grey gardens to remember them i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had
<START> this movie started me on a nick cage kick it is a story full of twists and turns a movie of motives and moves of course dennis hopper was a ham but j t walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web everything about this movie is good cinematography story pace and most of all the end cage excels at what he does best it's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life
<START> what if marylin monroe albert einstein joe dimaggio and senator mccarthy were to come together in a mind bending evening of relativity br br this delightful roman Ã  clef never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you won't like this film it is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it br br dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a united nations hell bent for nukes being visited by marylin monroe after filming the notorious seven year itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with joe dimaggio they have a lovely interplay in which einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times br br enter senator mccarthy who thinks einstein is a red he is determined to extract einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the house unamerican activities committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace add joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as gary busey who hates marylin's exhibitionism and believes einstein has become her lover even though marylin only wants to show einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity br br but there's more br br just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today finally we see the shocking terror of einstein's vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear it is a powerful and memorable moment br br insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time it is utterly amazing
<START> i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that's always good unless it's just 'that was stupid' i loved this film you just don't get to see gem's like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
<START> what a mess why was this movie made this and other movies of its caliber should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie children may like it but anyone over 10 may or will disapprove to make matters worse was the fact that such great talent like whoopi goldberg and armin mueller stahl were entirely wasted in a film unworthy of any notice
<START> this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesn't add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the film br br william baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesn't fare much better there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr baldwin br br a movie to be seen at the viewer's own risk
<START> when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i've ever seen yes it was funny i mean i liked it all until the end where oh no i can't tell u should it for yourself it is funny except the vulgar language that's why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it but if not don't waist ur money on renting it or buying it
<START> dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent without dudley moore john gielgud liza minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood the psycho like music at the wedding fight but the acting overcomes it the character arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments but he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will the end is fairly corny though i wont give it away but it could be improved worth seeing many times
<START> henry hathaway was daring as well as enthusiastic for his love of the people of the early days in us history however to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film in my opinion hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release in often subtle filming and dialog delivery he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes br br i remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his film br br 1 love for all people regardless of their personal beliefs 2 charity to those in need or not 3 family is high in importance 4 listen respectfully and carefully because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt 5 work hard both individually and in community 6 prepare and store for future days of need 7 hope is a binding link to a higher being and for our daily lives 8 and that there is a unique quality to any group and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial
<START> as an ordinary movie watcher i can't say i enjoyed watching this one it's not too emotional for a drama not too gripping for a thriller not too fast for an action plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible ok i understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life carjack into the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away without having asked a question in a proper way it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so but it's supposed to be a serious film about war there are several episodes like this so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie and it needs considerable work br br it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural br br this picture left a question in my head why why they gave it an oscar why six and imho it's the most thrilling part of the movie
<START> fatty drives the bus is simply the funniest most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing br br this movie is by no means up to hollywood standards or even that of a straight to video movie fluff comedy starring terry hulk hogan in terms of camera work editing acting budget or anything else br br what this movie does have though is a very original and enjoyable story and it is obviously done by people who love making it and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfalls br br this movie proves that you don't need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing br br simply the best movie ever i don't care how you get it rent it order it steal it download it just see this movie br br now i just hope they make a dvd version
<START> i tried to like this slasher like i try to enjoy all slasher films i mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense how can you go wrong but unhinged i think is an example of that formula going wrong the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house it was as if they were under sedation and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight the film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those and leaves the movie pretty dull it's a shame because if the movie was better executed it would have have been ace the story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother the girls and the daughter in the old house there's some good nudity and occasional splashy bloodletting just not enough to give the film the kick it needed the finale is pretty twisted and fearsome and does give the film a big lift but sadly its too little too late so in my opinion one to avoid unless you really love obscure slasher films there's a fair amount of potential but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile
<START> samuel fuller is hardly one of america's great directors i'm not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood's great craftsmen but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts on time and on budget pickup on south street is a case in point on the surface it's one more of hollywood's early fifties' anti commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard boiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichÃ©s into a taut exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists the hero skip mccoy is a three time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end the girl in the caper candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is a stoolie and in an unusual approach to hollywood's battle against commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling he just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming at least for now a good guy br br plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is a surprise she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends or her clients want her to be and richard kiley who later would become a two time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly it's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us i mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la mancha br br more than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the feds and the commies moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style that muffin you grifted she's okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability br br the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller's talents and strengths in 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters skip and candy we're going to be involved with and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us br br says glenn erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an inconsequential story sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up stiff necked aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort he's right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years
<START> what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a head ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being ginger rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean as a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man some guy i don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt honestly i've never had a worse time watching an old b rate movie of this type and i've seen some real head slappers br br oh and the butler didn't do it because there wasn't a butler but pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler there ya go br br polarisdib
<START> i'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is i like bad films as they are often the most entertaining i love bad special effects bad acting bad music and inept direction with the exception of the music which was better than i had expected this movie had all of those qualities br br the special effects were amazingly bad the worst i've seen since my nintendo 64 some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot the big ben scene the train wreck wow there are so many bad effects on the plus side though some scenes of the alien walkers are well done br br the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been having been based directly on h g wells' book for having such good source material it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over the top as to make it funny and then there's the mustache the single most distracting piece of facial hair i've seen in a long time of course only half the movie contains acting the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots br br to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors with the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes the bad green screening it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie i wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie bravo mr hines bravo br br my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did have some friends who enjoy bad movies over drink play poker while watching it keep drinking and maybe you'll make it all the way through it does make for an excellent bad movie so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster
<START> my fondness for chris rock varies with his movies i hated him after lethal weapon 4 but i hated everyone in that movie after it i like him when he is himself and not holding back like in dogma well this is his best yet wasn't expecting this to be that good laughed my arse off the whole time chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy i've seen in quite some time loved it
<START> warning this review contains plot spoilers though nothing could spoil this movie any more than it already is it really is that bad br br before i begin i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so incredibly bad that you fall over laughing movies if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh this is the movie for you now without further ado my review br br this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal mart that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is secondly it stars the lame action star dolph lundgren that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd who would waste their money doing such a thing though as you might imagine there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd in fact there's not even a menu the movie just starts playing br br first the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one liners remarkably unbelievable fake dialogue and inappropriate comments like lee's comment on lundgren's err manhood which i'll mention later there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie the dialogue and plot go hand in hand as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning and then for again no reason at all lee's character pulls over to the side of the road runs around to the other side of the car and says i'm not going to let you go alone 'cause despite myself i like you and i don't want to see you get killed ' or something to that extent anyhow there are disgusting one liners mostly said by lee for instance when duking it out with a bad guy lee says you have the right to remain silent you have the right to be dead ' lastly i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgren's nether regions when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear lee says to him incase we die i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy ' yes he actually says that it makes no sense and isn't even possible lee never actually sees lundgren naked so how would he know but the writer threw it in the script anyway the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game and lee even admits it after lee and the underwear only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful wow this is sort of like a video game we just defeated the first wave ' br br second the plot of this movie is despicable it suffers in my opinion mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist the trailer for this movie which imdb has available for viewing by the way makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles this is extremely misleading however since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all they make very brief vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly written attempt for kenner lundgren's character to revenge the death of his parents whom the yakuza leader named yoshida killed when he was only 9 years old the entire plot can basically be summed up like this yoshida wants kenner dead kenner wants yoshida dead and the two try two kill each other and of course all the while kenner's sarcastic sidekick named johnny and played by brandon lee acts like an ignorant idiot and tia carrere gets naked twice br br the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie the dialogue is so unrealistic and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded br br finally we get to the heart of the movie's baseness the flagrantly bad action there are so many astoundingly bad unrealistic action sequences in this movie it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren for instance lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one handed without spilling his tea then when surprised by an oncoming speeding car lundgren casually leaps over it or how about when he reaches through a closed door grabs the villain on the other side pulls him back through the door and beats him up or when he picks up tia carrere gently walks not runs backward through a glass door that shatters around him and leaps down a one story height with tia still in arm only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them that is of course until the final fight scene of the movie lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds despite this lundgren remains in top notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida the evil super villain and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real fully sharpened katanas which the two use to sword fight now in addition to his bullet wound lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms does this stop him no of course not in fact a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida who gets pinned to a dartboard like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasn't injured at all god it's terrible br br all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary gratuitous nude scene every five minutes including topless women at a party the beheading of a topless woman women at a strip club nude women at a japanese spa and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women which by the way prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will go eat fish off those naked chicks ' which of course is followed by a disturbing high five and we can't forget the terrible editing either like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all br br in the end this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness it is illogical and impossible and as a result remarkably entertaining if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema this movie will make you want to die if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making this movie will delight you as an actual movie i'll merit this movie a 0 5 out of 10 as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes however this beauty takes the cake
<START> when i first heard about the title i thought of 'the simpsons' just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character mcbain he is rescued from a vietnam pow camp by some of his buddies one of which is santos chick vennera yanks who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can re do the favor to him if he ever gets into trouble br br then 18 years later santos and his sister christina maria conchita alonso the running man predator 2 join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator el presidente victor argo taxi driver king of new york and when santos fails the mission christina goes to mcbain for help br br mcbain then asks his good ol' vietnam buddies to help him first there's the token tough black guy eastland played by american ninja 's steve james who was also in director james glickenhaus' previous movie the exterminator where the exterminator's real name also was eastland coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator among other things the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders mask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a welding job on top of a bridge br br the other guys in the vietnam pack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael ironside total recall starship troopers and then there's the doc dalton played by jay patterson who doesn't look like the guy the imdb is linking to and i haven't seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least there's the cop gill who has had enough of his unsatisfying job he's played by thomas g waites who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing br br and in other big roles we find luis guzmÃ¡n boogie nights carlito's way as a small time drug dealer who can't get a decent job also there is dick boccelli as the drug dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain gang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat grinder by john eastland in the exterminator movie now i haven't seen glickenhaus' shakedown blue jean cop yet but i'm almost ready to bet half a hundred dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too br br well back to the plot of this movie they go off to colombia and saves the day yay but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the action scenes are very well done and you're never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all action lovers
<START> savage island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you trust me br br when the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city slicker tourists pa savage wants revenge and he'll stop at nothing until he gets it br br this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments br br also the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera work in order to reflect the dark murky and egdy mood of the story in other words to obtain a certain aesthetic br br in fact the film has won several horror film festival awards
