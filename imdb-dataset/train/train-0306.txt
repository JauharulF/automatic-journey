<START> hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film br br in this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to return br br the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer although a genius he was also very disturbed in many ways br br in the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself going from 128 players to just 2 in the final but this was a group knockout which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each other br br the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail enjoy http uk youtube com watch v xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon
<START> cassavetes was clearly an intelligent sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films he wanted to be an auteur to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema for that i applaud him br br unfortunately as a member of his audience i cannot applaud a woman under the influence cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic an insane woman and somehow managed to craft a dull film filled with lengthy ad libbed ranting and drawn out scenes he seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person's life on film and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not yet i found the performances particularly rowlands' to be artificial i never believed for a moment that she was really insane i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed yet i've never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence she played it like a very obnoxious uninhibited woman who drinks a lot and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once at the beginning but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film there are some moments in which she taps into something real but those moments are few and far between she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character again i applaud her efforts but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true br br novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly just to prove that they 'get it ' but don't be brainwashed by the hype judge for yourself you don't have to pretend to like it br br like woody allen john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film making seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self indulgent but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie if cassavetes had employed some self discipline and a sharp pair of editing shears a woman under the influence could have stood a chance but what's the point of making a 'realistic' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti establishment deity without dumbing anything down i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot instead of presenting a string of 30 minute long scenes of ad libbed arguments if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans you're just reaching the already converted watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it if you are truly moved and fascinated by it good for you
<START> it's hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious br br i was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker br br the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so then it'll be enjoyable
<START> this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england so that says a lot right there the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though the upside is seeing the nice secretary sheila in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr rat face this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal there is also a watch that gets teleported away and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of the sixth sense only a lot more dull and british add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr rat which results in nothing plus the electrocuting of a lot of people plus a cat and you have yourself ummm a british movie the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there bests
<START> the first point that calls the attention in for ever mozart is the absence of a plot summary in imdb the explanation is simple since there is no story screenplay plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie jean luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie and it is funny to read their reviews br br my vote is one br br title brazil para sempre mozart forever mozart
<START> i didn't know this was a silent movie with narration i don't care for silent movies the corny humor flickering lighting and film etc i'm sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it it was about chapter 8 before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen maybe this appeals to the sci fi crowd the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater isabella rosselinni narrated this movie the one enjoyable aspect of the movie no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story i cannot recommend this movie
<START> i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for though it has its confusing parts of the plot it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie that being said if you're not open to more liberal political ideas then this probably isn't the movie for you i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area but that's intentionally done john cusack is right in that although it's set in the future it really makes you see the present
<START> nick cage is gates a treasure hunter oh excuse me treasure protector whatever that means who is descended from a long line of treasure hunters one of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our founding fathers most if not all freemasons had decided to hide because they just didn't want to finance their independence all that badly br br the first clue turns out to be in a long lost ship hidden in the arctic gates and his crew consisting of financier ian sean bean movie dork riley justin bartha of the immortal gigli and a couple of faceless lackeys enter the cargo hold of the ship they immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor not that this is significant in any way at last they find the clue a skeleton is hovering over it and it turns out to be a pipe with writing on it sort of don't ask me to explain br br it's a riddle and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle in this frozen cargo hold while the crew just stands around slack jawed i mean come on someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking arctic and not finding anything interesting but they just stand there as gates enters his own world solving the riddle br br the next clue turns out to be on the declaration of independence ian decides to steal it gates is appalled various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition get used to it all this leads to ian's lackey pulling a gun on gates and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion oh that's why they spilled all the gunpowder huh ian and his henchmen make their escape and gates and movie dork riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an inuit village in order to stop them br br to stop them gates concludes after trying the fbi and super archivist abigail chase diane kruger gates and riley must steal it themselves riley then tells gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the declaration because it's so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah gates then tells riley that there's an opportunity to steal it from the preservation room does riley know what the preservation room is gates asks a place where they make jams and jellies i am not kidding that's the actual line bartha doesn't deliver it like a joke either so riley does all this research about the library of congress and the archives and water and sewage fercryinoutloud but doesn't know what the preservation room is this pretty much indicates what level this script is on br br to make the rest of this short gates does in fact make off with the d of i in a ridiculous break in that could only happen in a movie i also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts abigail chase ends up tagging along for convenience's sake and as an obvious love interest angle at one point the three of them on the run from the law discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store surrounded by people br br a series of clues and the kidnapping of gates' father played by a dyspeptic jon voight leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge indiana jones fun house located underneath new york city odd that the subway builders never found this thing gates and gates senior lead ian off on a wild goose chase ian believes they're trapped in a cul de sac and leaves them there however after they're gone riley asks how they're going to get out gates br br oh boy br br presses a button and a door opens no i'm serious a button like they might have on a vacu flush lavatory in an office building good thing he knew where that was anyway after some more knob twiddling they find this immense treasure room remember this is all underneath manhattan full of all sorts of historyish golden things riley gets to deliver a really stupid line again and fbi officer harvey keitel forgives them arrests sean bean and allows the two chemistry less leads to get married br br for any viewer i think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition the leaps of logic and the stereotyped characters for very long though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments i'd like more conversations like that in my life
<START> i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked i watched the whole series in like 2 days i really liked gary cole's character first he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character these things have a thousand uses his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great charming charismatic smarmy and uh kind of dangerous and by kind of i mean really i wanna be like him when i grow up lucas black is great too the accents are great too anyway i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it
<START> this film is one of the more risquÃ© black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the hoyts code was enforced it's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there br br barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns lily powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money br br i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain the filming and different scenes were something fantastic the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks making this film full of realism br br this film was all together an alright movie the ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been but it didn't entirely ruin it baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once and suggested to some people and friends
<START> wow stacy peralta has followed up dogtown and z boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big wave surfing culture in america piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends we are transported into the daring and free spirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions br br it's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth you can feel the respect peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of greg noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge 50 foot swells off hawaii's north coast or jeff clark surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california and the storybook history of laird hamilton today's surfing icon hearing greg noll reverently refer to hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spine br br as an aside noll clark and others were at the sundance screenings noll humbly described himself as an old over the hill surfer he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the film br br riding giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer the gut wrenching vertical drops required to get into them and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell br br all this and the movie has more for those of us that didn't live in california in the 60's we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture and to my surprise the impact of the movie gidget on surfing peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment i'm not a surfer but like the rest of the sundance audience i was absolutely captivated by this film peralta is staking his claim as the big kahuna of american documentaries
<START> this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but i didn't it seemed to be trying way too hard to be 'artsy' all flash with no content it has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that i'm a big shakespeare fan but i was very disappointed i just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring
<START> it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam hoss and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western br br perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights people have relationships some go good some not so good it's just life and we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact but that's if bonanza were done today br br but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of bonanza's success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinch br br the cartwrights became and still are an american institution i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that br br pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show rumor has it he didn't care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious perhaps if it were done now he'd have liked it better in the way i describe br br this was just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the cartwrights br br when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan blocker left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family br br so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city it doesn't look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are real br br and if they weren't real they should have been
<START> tony scott can make good films and bad personally i think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother but this is quite possibly his best film br br what makes this film so great is that scott gives denzel on scorching form better than training day and the revelation who is dakota fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness the set up is absolutely not boring although it takes time it is involving and takes us on a little journey into the characters including a superb role for radha mitchell as the mother this all serves to make the action so much more effective as we are so invested in the characters for all their all too obvious weaknesses this film has you on the edge for its entirety and doesn't cop out at the end either br br the film would of course be nothing without washington i often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there i can only really think of one daniel day lewis who has more on screen power these days this film should have been huge given his status and the strength of his performance and the quality of the film it just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt it ends up going straight to video i wish i'd got the chance to see this on the big screen
<START> in the periphery of sÃ£o paulo the very low middle class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of teodoro giulio lopes clÃ¡udia leona cavalli and the teenager soninha sÃ­lvia lourenÃ§o have deep secrets the religious teodoro is indeed a hit man hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend waldomiro ailton graÃ§a he has a lover the very devout woman terezinha martha meola and he wants to regenerate going to the country with her clÃ¡udia has a young lover jÃºlio ismael de araÃºjo who delivers meats for his father's butcher shop soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery having active sexual life smoking grass and loving heavy metal when jÃºlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood the lives of the members of the family change br br contra todos is a great low budget brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big brazilian city the story is very real uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big brazilian cities drug dealers hit men fanatic religious evangelic people hopeless teenagers etc has many plot points and a surprising end and the characters have excellent performances acting very natural and making the story totally believable the camera follows the characters giving a great dynamics to the film in the extras of the dvd the director roberto moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines only the description of the situations and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings the actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation being the reason for such natural acting my vote is eight br br title brazil contra todos against everybody
<START> yet another colourful excuse for men in rubber suits to wrestle with each other this time around time travellers from the future arrive in 1992 and recruit a few people to go back with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of godzilla thus saving a future japan from destruction but having accomplished this task the time travellers are revealed to be a bunch of double crossers whose own creature goes on the rampage and with no godzilla to stop itÂ eek it all sounds very silly and it probably is but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good too unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish rather than enjoyably rubbish and the movie turns out to be just as dull as its predecessors look out for the shaky spielberg in joke
<START> simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene saks and given life by the immense talents of lemmon and matthau no one delivers these lines better no one times them better nobody does it better
<START> this whole film should have lasted 45 minutes maximum although an interesting concept theme it really did not develop as a story once the initial idea of a brave stupid bomb disposal expert cowboy are introduced and this happens very early in the film the rest is repetitious characters were not explored and aspects of the location and politics were ignored there was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe but the way in which the unit operated stretched belief individual performances were good and special effects were adequate but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content
<START> wow a danish movie with this kind of content i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx everything was where it should be br br and a danish efx house producing those vfx wow this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality br br spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost movie end of spoiler br br but anyway this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of br br the only bad about this is that it wasn't a danish director but a swedish
<START> this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn't have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie don't see it but then again thats my opinion
