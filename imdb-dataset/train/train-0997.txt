<START> upon viewing tobe hooper's gem crocodile in 2000 i developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts with ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants br br while tobe hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages rip offs to jaws temple of doom indiana jones' last crusade the convent godzilla 2000 and any james bond movie also try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock br br i was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism or crocky appreciation but the quasi captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach perhaps in the coming years we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero g monkey midget crocodile bloodshed br br all in all the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me
<START> cult classics are nearly impossible to predict who could guess that vision quest fight club and 2001 a space oddysey movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release would become immensely popular like many imdbers i consider myself a movie expert unlike the majority of those who hated envy evidenced by a dismal 4 4 rating i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade br br the plot of the movie is ridiculous the dialogue isn't clever the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader but that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious you see in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically detached point of view br br why do i love envy because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good this is the recipe for a cult classic and envy definitely fits the bill
<START> bradford dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene having partial amnesia or global amnesia which one character claims to define as elective loss of memory the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of piecing his life back together abhorrent concoction very loosely based on walter ericson's book fallen angel filmed in 1965 as mirage with gregory peck it was probably too racy for television what with drugs and hippies added to the mix that nbc initially refused to air it which is how this low budgeter wound up in theaters director james goldstone gets freaky with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks while editor edward a biery goes wild with the zig zag cuts unfortunately their admittedly colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot and the acting is woefully overripe dillman under pressure to recall the events of the night in question goes through an actor's seminar of tics stammers nose wipes and crazy half laughs while spitting out dialogue like dream a dream drugs yeah drugs that sound bells help as a villainous fellow scientist with a cheshire cat smile pat hingle nearly upstages dillman in the grand thespian department by continually addressing everyone in baby talk strutting about like a middle aged peacock and twisting his mouth around in agony hope lange's scientist love interest is given the short shrift but not before she screams at indifferent lover dillman what do i have to do talk ape man me want you this is one frantic jigsaw 1 2 from
<START> basically i like verhoeven film because in his film i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in basic instinct it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much so it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie br br well it is his previous direction before his block buster hit basic instinct and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation br br this movie the fourth man is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences the story of this movie is about a gay writer named reve krabbe an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident after the end of his lecture he introduce a seductive woman named christine who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy next morning he watch her sexy macho boyfriend's picture on her table the person he met at the station he is curious to meet him and tell christine to invite him to her house br br that's it i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising br br especially i like the character reve which is brilliantly played by krabbe i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face br br i would like thanks mr verhoeven to make such a black comedy br br i rate this movie 10 out of 10
<START> ya that is what i think sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without br br i love having c j and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together br br when john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do now br br it is too bad that no more are being made i don't think because i would love to see some new material br br my favorite character must be rory poor rory is almost always left out it is always about bridget or carrie what about rory honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it i almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle
<START> i saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one i think it was the latter first of all it was inaccurate in many small yet important details one of the first things i noticed was during winston's day to day life in his work his conversations eating in the cafeteria etc he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear one of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment this is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions in the book winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip while in the movie he does it so often and without fear that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat br br other minor inaccuracies included winston hiding his diary in the wall yes a very small change but it begs the question what's the point there was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book and that is morphing characters br br the large inaccuracies were far more disturbing however first of all one of the important pieces of the book is that big brother is a government based on an intelligent yet crude philosophy in the movie they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by hitler with technology which is true in a sense when directed with its facism but if that's all you get out of big brother you really missed the point of the book the terrifying thing about big brother is that in a way it has some points behind its philosophy when o'brien is picking at winstons mind in the ministry of love he is listening to everything winston says against big brother the fact that he listens and advances forward in his philosophy is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing in the end careful spoiler ahead when winston says he loves big brother the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this or the actual power behind the philosophy i am in no way saying that the big brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing br br also how could anyone feel any connection between julia and winston in the film it was awful no connection whatsoever br br and where was o'brien before he gave winston his address one of the things that carried the book was winstons thoughts about o'brien before he made contact with him in the movie they just jump the gun br br but that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption because its impossible not to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours how could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours at the very least the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections anything less is just pointless br br if you loved the book and i mean truly adored it you will not approve of this movie and chances are you already knew you wouldn't because the book is unfilmable and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film br br two stars out of ten
<START> as an native of bolton this film has obvious appeal for me the location shots are fascinating and show a bolton very much in transition there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full blown generational conflict then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution though i'm a bit too young to remember it fully the minutiae of lancashire life in the 60s is all here cashing up on a friday songs round the piano the sunday constitutional good neighbourliness the trepidations of courtship the massive importance of self respect and i was pleased to see naughton's funniest lines from the play left intact there is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on dvd it is well crafted and most performances are well realised
<START> i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that my girl friend turned to me and said we have to go see this movie enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music there was absolutely no character development br br the plot is just well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer that's brilliant hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me her longest line must have been half a sentence and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression br br please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this and if your like me and don't have a choice well then i wish you good luck maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine can't believe this film got made
<START> i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first cigarette burns was by far the best from season 1 and i did like other episodes from that season oh how i was disappointed br br in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing the characters aside from the subject matter seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker texas ranger the acting was bad and i normally like ron perlman a lot but i can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible i'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror obviously with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion in this case not surprisingly it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti abortionists and i am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that i was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency this failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing br br while i don't think carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here i will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for there are a couple small bits that i found nice hence the 2 stars i gave it br br the actual gore and monster effects were good but the cgi gore two separate gunshots to the head were so obviously inferior quality cgi they should've never been given the ok i'm generally very critical of cgi but not because i have a problem with it in principle i have a problem with the execution of it the technology while amazing in some respects is not good enough to match real effects whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and or alive and therefore shouldn't be used until they are cgi can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated br br i'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title masters of horror is a bad title to have there simply aren't many actual masters of horror around maybe two or three if the show were called tale of horror or something like that it would be fine but as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes and therefore being criticized for not being a master of horror is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career and it didn't even have to be a good one
<START> i couldn't relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving i couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it br br i've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology i'll admit that as an atheist i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs
<START> when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington d c his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda br br a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub al khali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her br br a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried forty nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the iran contra affair its tone might have been different br br the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character pretty sweet natured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a 35 year old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl br br the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his her material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blue eyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the mini series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the film makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter day mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen's duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blahÂÂ but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy br br goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 3 10
<START> let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies i never watch them br br let me tell you about my experience br br the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feet br br i never saw happy feet but i am sure it is better than this movie anyway we didn't actually expect it to be good we actually went in just to laugh at it cool with me i have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out it did not matter br br after 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into borat a movie i would have gladly seen again over this the movie was not scary and not stupid so it would be funny it was just boring it wasn't terrible like baby genuises terrible it was terrible like not entertaining at all avoid br br now i am no expert but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg 13 horror that is boring and not scary or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people br br you want a pg 13 horror that sucks but is funny see the grudge avoid this movie like the plague because it may literally bore you to death br br 0 10
<START> i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre it was actually sold out i actually went to see solaris instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002 br br victor rosa john leguizamo a tough streetwise 'street pharmacist' freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack peter sarsgaard things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish denise richards this happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist but they did so it's not br br in fact there's not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview if you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps go to the website download the preview save yourself 3 99 there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack is br br i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired twice most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets and i may shatter the fabric of the space time continuum with a concept as mind numbing as this they both had less talent and musical ability br br the acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and denise richards is at best 67 styrofoam and 33 ziploc bag you know things are bad when john leguizamo he was in the pest upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities
<START> this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do the original kicked some major tire squealing butt this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films which is we all know they suck but they have great action this film has no action this film is boring where are the cars where are the chases where's the tension where's the suspense where's the rush where this isn't really a movie at all it's a bad commercial 50 cars in 24 hours that is wrong they have 3 days to steal them the ad is wrong how bad is that the leads acting is stiff wooden and forced the villain the cop the others who cares they utter their pointless lines they serve the illogical plot they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is or we'll fix it with lots of loud music the script isn't really a script at all it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of warning possible spoiler 5 4 3 2 1 the fugitive the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones man this is the baddest coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction and what do they do they make him a mute who's hardly in the film make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film how could they have been so dumb how how why the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away the original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers go find the original or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent ronin the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged bruckheimer and cage had all that money all those resources all that experience and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for 250 000 how can that be you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie where i was once excited to see coyote ugly remember the titans and pearl harbor now i say god help us all br br
<START> tries to be funny and fails miserably the animation is just terrible looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep plot is dull and cliched if you have a young child maybe rent it but don't waste hard earned money to pay to see it br br 1 10
<START> whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy br br this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles there is not one decent performance in it even the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully unfunny br br the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon br br maud adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable she is not kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better br br i've flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet avoid
<START> why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome everyone should know what an excellent movie this is it is engaging and funny from moment one original and well acted i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves br br for anyone that loved the princess bride labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones robert deniro is hysterical relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man claire danes is fantastic as always michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters even down to facial expressions
<START> this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge fine casting especially the choice of scott who plays the role to the hilt a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption a modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> this film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that gerard depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years his performance shocks entertains disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless this film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw but still is able to convey the mastery of depardieu a must see for any depardieu fan and by far his best early work
<START> i didn't really know what this movie was about when i went to the theater to see it hype about the satanism etc etc etc as the trailers in the last movie i saw looked pretty interesting br br oh dear roman catholic mythology not my idea of a good scare and honestly i just felt like watching a really good scary movie not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes br br i'll try to keep away from the spoilers but i found it very odd that an atheist who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest could suddenly end up with christ's wounds aren't stigmata supposed to be deeply religious i mean she hangs out with losers does loser stuff behaves like a typical rebel et al and here she is displaying the wounds of jesus christ come on br br scenes of her crucified head thrown back screaming blood everywhere became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times it was neither frightening or scary just repulsive it did however become quite painful to watch those flicking scenes were highly annoying br br conclusion if your a catholic defintly don't see this if you're not still don't see it
