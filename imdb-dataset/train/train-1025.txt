<START> okay so robbie's a little hokey looking by today's standards and some of the acting is pretty stilted and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program and don't get me started about the poster br br this is still a great movie 40 years after it was released i grew up watching science fiction on the local tv station's science fiction adventure theater on sunday afternoons so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the '50s at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot br br i doubt that many sf movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030
<START> i must say that i was disapointed with this film i have never been a huge bnl fans i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim creegan was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know they've had better moments as in the afgahnistan concert koffee anan he's the man in charge my name's steve paige and i'm really large br br bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull blue song by effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly chewed off my own arm bnl is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name gordon is quintessentially canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah they're brand new but they're all in their 30's while the rest of canada is going oh geez i thought those guys folded years ago do i have to listen to 'million dollars' again br br the concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think they're all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it the interviews with moses znaimer a canadian media mogule and terry david mulligan music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionally br br this movie doesn't really document very much either i mean it's basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage it's not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular it's a methodically planned out event so in the end it's rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either br br
<START> generally speaking the plot was much better than i was expecting the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way however there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers spade in particular was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions but his character comes across quite well in the pilot there is is enough eye candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them now if the writers can just live up to what they have begun
<START> godzilla vs king ghidorah is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo patriotism here travellers from the future try to ruin japan replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster the three headed golden dragon king ghidorah they fail however and in the end godzilla fights ghidorah the battles between the two behemoths are very cool but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about japan is great is really stupid the creators of this movie didn't even threat with respect the enemies of japan making them stupid big blond guys who are easily outsmarted by the clever japanese the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king ghidorah nearly destroyed the both japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one actually two spectacular combats but till this battle royale the film was really dull and pathetic
<START> i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse supposibly children's film i have ever seen in my life br br i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them it's truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences br br aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards stephen
<START> saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it i'm a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal climatic happened in a scene br br i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn't seen in ten years and with the gunshot signal 'two shots and then one' she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch the reason she left town in the first place all at the same time the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50's br br love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the 'bunny hug' is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd br br one of the best films from that period i've seen in a long time
<START> i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd yay it's striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired br br the central performances are gripping the scripts are layered br br i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035 br br i've been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way br br well unlike imdb's submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everything br br in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation br br when the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it don't get more controversial than that
<START> the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powers esquire cheese here and there br br it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous witty yes but not humorous unfortunately it's witless rather than witty br br with this new m4tv mini series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well thought out plot and some nice complementing sub plots br br now this attempt is not the all out action extravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq ksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here br br steve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be br br this version rates a 9 8 10 on the tv scale from br br the fiend
<START> forget the jaded comments that come before these this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting well acted even by elizabeth berkley recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change
<START> this superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form levant crosby martin rathbone manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by billy wilder one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it because it's an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile master fertile servant tale nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry run by dried up numskulls but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and non wasps looking at the last six decades of music tv and film in the us it's hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic
<START> irritating illogical flow of events pretty much every joke is so simple that it can hardly be regarded as one no wonder the cinema was empty and people actually walked away yes away i stayed since i was enjoying a wonderful ice cream with nuts during the whole movie
<START> i enjoy quality crapness and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least pre dates our world and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so goddamn awful and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i don't know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it wont however on a brighter note i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it
<START> i'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms filmmaker film or movie in connection with this but criminal and crime against humanity seem a bit harsh br br the writing pathetic br br the directing pathetic br br the acting pathetic br br the cinematography too inept for words br br the technical skills used to assemble this atrocity none whatsoever br br this lump of waste could hardly be called cinema the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than revenge quest no this is just a 10 car pile up caught on video br br we'll skip the plot in this review because there are far too many holes to be covered at once let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie to call the acting one dimensional would be giving them credit what little there is is atrocious to begin with and made much worse by the terrible video and editing br br the worst part of this atrocity though apart from the plot would have to be the effects or rather the disturbing lack thereof there are no blanks in the guns no flashpots and what few sound effects existed were either stock gun sounds or they were generated by mouth yeah you read that right the filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a shh sound for the elevator doors i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic this is supposed to be set in the year 2031 after all that doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist fight scenes however br br if it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera and it shows the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep and they're just as clumsy picture this the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey a lady starts to run in fear he raises his gun an uzi and shakes it we hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi the woman runs away from camera and suddenly a single blood pack only 1 explodes on her back looked like she was hit by a paintball and she falls flat on her face br br bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence br br in another sequence one which almost but not quite makes the movie funny enough to watch takes place in a stairwell the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs shaking his plastic uzi all the way you may wish to duck there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place br br i supposed alan deherrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it if there's any justice there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it br br should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste and i would strongly advise against it be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from bladerunner and the am radio that doubles as a walkie talkie try not to focus too hard on the plot it will only hurt you more if you do br br 0 stars of 10 and that's being generous
<START> yes this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great entertainers as frank sinatra and gene kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of kathryn grayson the music and dancing is superb i understand frank took lessons from kelly and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse which is quite unique for the time betty garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra she is one of hollywood's great underrated stars i saw this again on a e tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes never get tired of these old musicals whatever happened to hollywood
<START> intensive care by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner the acting is abysmal the action is slow and the climax is laughable a famous surgeon has a car accident he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage intensive care is clearly influenced by american slasher films including halloween and friday the 13th series the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look you'll laugh until it hurts with this one you can believe me
<START> who was george c scott george c scott was a renowned actor practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it now ol' george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie but he once said something that describes said movie to a t br br i don't recall his exact words but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting cannot save bad writing never has this little observation been truer than in the all new adventures of laurel hardy for love or mummy br br the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect bronson pinchot laurel and gailard sartain hardy not only look the parts but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal mannerisms and all this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents that said this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to you guessed it writing br br aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain which was very in character and a brief gag involving a taxi this movie is an absolute chore to sit through br br problem 1 too much time and effort went into the plot br br i don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady what i want is to see stan and ollie or at least their stand ins way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around br br however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us with br br problem 2 most of the jokes are what i would call watered down slapstick br br what do i mean by watered down br br in slapstick a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ala looney tunes 3 stooges or how about laurel hardy br br in watered down slapstick as i define it a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect br br maybe an illustration would help br br in looney tunes daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd his bill falls off and he puts it back on that is classic slapstick br br in this gem ollie accidentally bumps into some people they turn around tell him to be careful and continue on their merry way that's not slapstick that's not even funny that's just boring and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes it's as though they're this movie's bread and butter the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny granted the example i just gave is the most extreme case but i can only cut it so much slack br br long story short the film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot's and sartain's abilities to impersonate stan and ollie instead the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with br br not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aid br br i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of atoll k and be big
<START> they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors the budget and the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much and also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later
<START> warning tons of dead giveaways don't read if you haven't seen this series or you can whatever br br they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another liars cheats maybe even some words that can't be uttered but when elm street 6 freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero or villian just stops for his final breath this film was it br br this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz then you see a kid who is named only as john doe who is the last child in springwood ohio leaves and gets out of freddy territory a woman who resides at a hospital place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in her mind goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision and soon finds out that she is freddy's child and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him and beyond that fright ensues this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know br br this film has tons of humor and cameo appearences like rosanne barr and tom arnold alice cooper johnny depp and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterfly's in a gadda da vida then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts this film will either make you hate this movie or like krueger even more the best of the best
<START> this is the version that even the author hated because it's so schmaltzy they gave it a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue and it's just a big pile of saccharine the 'stage manager' is quite good i believe he originated the role but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing the one great feature the music this has one of the best scores ever recorded and it's worth seeking out in a record shop overall i think the 1989 spalding grey eric stoltz penelope miller version is far superior
<START> anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 it looked like it could be funny but i wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster br br about a year and a half later i was at tower records and in the dvds for less than 20 pile there was a copy of this movie seeing that the dvd was only 6 99 i decided to buy it i got home put the disc in the dvd player and waited for the laughs to start and i waited some more the laughs never came br br i'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time no stars
