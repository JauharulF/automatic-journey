<START> yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak br br it's big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man's body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all
<START> i went into this movie with high hopes normally i'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are always fun to watch or so i thought i'll list the good parts of this movie the creature effects all of the creatures were well done their movements were realistic and they fit into the other imagery well to be honest the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1 now the bad things the acting good lord i've seen bad acting but this movie takes the cake not a single one of the characters is even close to believable it's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try outs from it i tried very hard not to giggle too loud cause i didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre but the acting really was that bad the storyline the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish you can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film the plot holes of course are complimentary with the cheese this is probably one of the most clichÃ©d not thought out and outright dumbest stories i've ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching parasite on the scifi channel the dialogue this is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichÃ©d thing they possibly can at every chance they possibly can in this world it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low budget creature movies it is the world of cheese and clichÃ© the special effects while the creature effects were downright awesome the special effects fail miserably yes they are better than those seen in other movies but a lot of it is in the presentation and this movie has no presentation whatsoever it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show to be honest to sum up dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money the concept is good but it is trapped in the bad directing acting dialogue and cheesiness of the film wait til the next big monster movie comes out it's gotta be better than this cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible
<START> just got through watching this version of samhain and even though i still like it it's nothing like the rough cut version i have if you check the message board you'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version 79 minutes and he says he had nothing to do with this r rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending christian really doesn't need to distant himself that much because the basic gore elements still stand up even though highly trimmed down this is a damn shame because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years it still has the porn stars and the inbreds and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen i'm just glad i have that rough cut because to me it's a jewel for any gorehounds library christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods and hopefully his next project will be better produced the idiots had a near classic in their hands and screwed it up for everybody samhain may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever and too bad gorehounds didn't get to see what the director intended br br just so you know what you missed this is my review based upon the work print of samhain br br the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops there is absolutely no music soundtrack and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog because i think they are meant to be looped in later however most of the movie does have audio with sound affects and when an effect or scene is missing a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed it's exactly as it says a rough cut but the only uncut version of samhain you are ever likely to see reason because the gore is extremely graphic much more than even an nc 17 would allow yes there are a few porn stars but they are just there for the killing and to add a little sugar and spice the story is pretty standard american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods an area that is heavy on folklore involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain or as we call it halloween spooky br br the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants this is a great gore scene as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff with her crying for help all he sees is her head arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up she has been completely sliced in two this is what i would call extreme gore with entrails blood and severed limbs all over the place we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks except the effects look much more realistic i'm going to just skip the story because it's your standard stalk and kill plot br br the next gore scene is something to behold as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location tcm 2 stuff and bound to a table this geek then cuts all of his limbs off off camera with a cue to insert a scene and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit turning slowly over a fire and the torso has a hard on if you can believe that yes very bad taste gross gruesome you find the right word and it will probably fit too br br then later jenna jameson her beautiful body and all is cut from neck to crotch and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee and her blood drains into a pot yummy a real turn on huh br br but the best gore scene happens inside the house and i have to admit this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen this guy doesn't matter who is caught from behind from a geek and cut open at the ass hole the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails intestines and what the hell ever else there is right from his asshole this goes on forever as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor this is so extreme so over the top that i found myself laughing all to hell obviously you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd imo along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes br br so what to think of all of this well first of all even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation it makes this rough cut a rare jewel for gorehounds yes it's a little difficult at first with no soundtrack a few scenes to still be inserted and credits that have missing names all over the place but that's what makes this so unique and i wouldn't trade it for anything right now extreme gore yes yes extreme extreme gore this makes haute tension look like a disney movie

<START> i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of it's vision i enjoyed every page br br i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael radford might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book adopter the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith br br what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writing br br you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed br br the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting
<START> i was never a big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was well acted and had a great story but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick's the shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever br br the movie follows a writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block after months of solitude and silence however jack becomes a grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad br br one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also eerily calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways jack nicholson's performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk in refrigerator br br the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie 8 10
<START> you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason well out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t rex knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t rex from jurassic park i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie br br i was not disappointed in the least br br mad scientists secret formulas a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives and of course a big poorly animated sock puppet t rex is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies not to mention the rex's hungry is never satisfied ever how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat really if you look down his mouth when he roars it's solid like a toy or something now i like watching incredibly bad b movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is this one was hilarious i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where make no mistake you will laugh br br do i blame the movie's budget yes but the acting didn't help either ok tony todd was actually pretty good as for some of the female roles when you cry shouldn't tears come out meh i am not going to be angry at this movie i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends here's what i recommend watch this movie then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back you will be writing mr spielberg thank you letters the next day
<START> this should be re titled the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non horror snorer as a shock film it's one long boring tale of a fraternity hazing a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it jeff east an actor in the dues paying stage can be forgiven for taking any work he could get the same can't be said for charles martin smith who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah once available on tape but thankfully not out on dvd misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else
<START> this movie is an utter waste of time the plot is awful the dialogue is awful br br the acting is ok but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with the photography and some of the special effects are ok too but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch there is no logical progression to the story the story line is utter nonsense it isn't even scary for a movie to be scary there has to be at least a small element of believability this movie has no believability at all br br there are only three characters in the movie each character is shallow and has no personality br br most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done or at most mediocre br br i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie
<START> recap ron is about to marry mel they are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago todd ron's brother in law to be is not so happy he is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange ron's bachelor party but his real plan is to put ron in a compromising situation get evidence and break ron and mel up br br comments supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all it is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women actually in a way it is almost impressive have many you can put in there because they are everywhere unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself it simply isn't good enough br br it has three redeeming points though or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this it is lead actor josh cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense sara foster i know has more talent than to do movies like this and emanuelle vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie br br what is suspiciously absent are good jokes actually bad jokes are rather scarce too it just isn't funny br br 3 10
<START> hlots was an outstanding series its what nypd blue will never be on hlots the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with hlots back as a movie tying up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up wont say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide life on the streets network drama at its best 5 stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get
<START> i saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old b movies that are fun to watch i was so wrong this movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women the story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether it seemed to be in the same genre as the ed wood films bottom of the barrel
<START> released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska holland's own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii the american named leo doesn't fully get what he's doing there he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind it's about time germany was shown some charity no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro german merely mixed up his uncle who works on the railroad gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germany's horrors and enigmas br br this progression starts when leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jean marc barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab day to day timetable and the woman's uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier's shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere scenery br br another guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to leo americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train br br the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography he shoots in black and white and color he uses double exposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rear projected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise survey br br this grand jury prize winning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes br br the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones two trains halting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another an underwater shot of proliferating blood an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydow's voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint
<START> cavemen exceeded my expectations and not in a good way it was even worse than i thought it would be basically here's the show the cavemen are an alternate race they face prejudice etc quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created almost being worthy of jail time for the writers one show featured the cavemen going into a club trying to pick up girls and then nothing else happened it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals for those who have not seen this show here's an example of the dialog you're sure you're okay with going out with a caveman yeah that's fine i've had like 10 thousand hilarious possibly the best writing i've ever witnessed br br 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup tackling tough social issues sounds like an entertaining night i also love how bad the recent ideas are that they're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials i wonder if they'll do the gecko next so that i can have a new title for the worst show i've ever seen i would even say that this is worse than viva laughlin at least viva laughlin was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired br br shows like this make me hope that there's a comet up there somewhere aimed for earth br br unratable honestly
<START> the plot doesn't offer any new excitements it even starts the same as cube i this time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery except for having an extra exit which is not guarded very ingenious the characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera br br if somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps really there is nothing much else to say about it
<START> maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5 and i cried my eyes out between then and now embarrassed at age 15 i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them don't worry they're tears of happiness and it's not all sap there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case my only word of advice even if you love this don't see the sequal cornyness i suggest everyone checks this out you won't be sorry no matter how old or young you are
<START> note i thought i'd be the only one writing what i did below but i see the others here agree i guess it was pretty obvious this was overdoing the bait the cat bit anyway here is what i had written br br the owners have left on vacation for two weeks a trip to california leaving the cat sylvester all alone and locked in the house that means no milk but the cat to his relief does find a bunch of canned tuna however to his dismay he can't find the opener br br it turns out the little mouse in the house has it and baits the cat with it this is a mean rodent who keeps teasing sylvester with the opener and then yanking it away at the last second sylvester tries everything possible to open the can of tuna but can't do it br br this is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse the good guy is beyond me it's like some of the tom jerry cartoons where poor tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict
<START> i totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end we couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary's part in the whole thing was why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either very strange but maybe we missed something crucial
<START> what we've got here is a situation a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him in contrasting ways at the end they are forced to let it go you can't fix people and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood that message isn't br br this story is not about charlie fineman adam sandler a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9 11 plane who's gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since it's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson don cheadle a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy spots him on the street and reconnects charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair the hair is sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod wielding subway rider br br charlie is a disaster but paradoxically alan stuck with a controlling wife jada pinkett smith soon begins to envy him charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund insurance money from the tragedy and starts dragging alan off to hang out eat chinese buy records or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady redoing the kitchen over and over collecting old vinyl of springsteen the who etc and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room br br charlie's in laws are deeply concerned about him but also somehow resentful as we learn later alan has a new patient who is propositioning him charlie's desperation makes us see alan's trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them br br cheadle and sandler make an odd couple but that doesn't matter because it's convincing that they might both need each other charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family because to escape his loss he is pretending he never had one and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste no motown alan wants an escape from his tidy emasculating life he's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice they're white by the way and he's black br br there's also the lascivious patient from hell who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she's a babe his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute he's also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help br br sandler's mad scenes are a little too theatrical as are a lot of the plot devices in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching br br charlie's not just delusional and sad but dangerous and violent and all these efforts to help him start to backfire the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can't be made right this is an interesting movie sometimes a touching one and it's the first time 9 11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times many of the people are too broadly drawn and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful dÃ©cor only the manhattan streets look real there's a courtroom scene that is preposterous and donald sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true alan's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call and yet this is worth watching for the acting the control and subtlety of cheadle and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p t anderson's 2002 punch drunk love though that's clearly a better movie in fact a much better one
<START> well the big money machine has done it again disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video good or bad stamped with the disney moniker why is it that i continue to look forward to these sequels which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci cinderella 2 consists of three storylines already a poor choice doesn't one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story of these three only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect the music is atrocious and modern meaning in 2 years it will already be dated and adds nothing to the story why does everything have to be updated you know the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style gee i can't wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty instead of music based on the themes of tchaikovsky we'll get music inspired by britney spears so disney if you're listening remember we're not all indiscriminate children out here how about throwing a bone or two to the fans who've been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap
