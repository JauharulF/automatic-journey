<START> i took my 10 year old daughter to see nancy drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained first off it was clean and i mean by my standards the majority of kids' movies today are full of crude toilet humor and gross out jokes to elicit cheap laughter from the pre teen crowd nancy drew is smarter than that however and the humor is subtle and clever br br the title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by emma roberts who is perky and polite without ever becoming annoying unlike the brady bunch movie where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity it's a great moment when the la style conscious girls with their paris hilton streetwalker attire are dismissed by the boutique owner while nancy in her penny loafers and homemade butterick pattern dress is embraced this movie shuns the we need to enlighten this wholesome girl tack so many hollywood movies take nancy remains true to herself and her values throughout br br the mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging there were several suspenseful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm but there were no gratuitous shock scenes it's all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun the supporting cast is good particularly marshall bell as the creepy caretaker there are some great cameos by eddie jemison chris kattan and bruce willis and many moments that will make adults smile br br this film deserves better ratings than some have given it not only was i glad not to be dragged to yet another computer animated film where talking animals burp and pass gas all over the place but i was also very entertained had i been there without a child i still would've enjoyed the movie this is one dvd that will have my daughter's name on it under the christmas tree
<START> this movie is awesome i watched it the other day with my cousin jay jay he said it was alright but i think it rulezzz i mean it's so cool ted v mikels is so brave and smart he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot it could have been better though i like ninjas and pirates i also like that big talon that the funny man wears i think he's the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy not only does this movie look really cool like those out of focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned 6 but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated but they all meet up in the end it's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up i wish ted v mikels would make a sequel but it needs more aliens and a pirate
<START> the idea of making a film about the beatles sounds doomed idea as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic beatles then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available beatles material this is exactly what 'birth of the beatles' offers to us the simple story known to us without any extravaganza br br spoilers here on br br be warned that not everything is that accurate as some beatles graduates might expect the beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time the beatles perform ask me why p s i love you and even don't bother me the beatles graduates should see that if the beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at hamburg the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the beatles they have learned to know them of that original hamburg repertoire only johnny b goode and stu sutcliffe's love me tender are retained br br the guys who play the beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate the guy who plays lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either brian epstein is great and the moment when he sacks pete best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film also as a bonus you get to see the original cavern club in the film
<START> i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be i'll at least get to see him kick some ass right wrong this is a dull dreary mess of pointless talking half assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming there are few action scenes of any kind even fewer martial arts scenes and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on the dub is also atrocious and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia except they're all japanese avoid like the plague you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes
<START> simply put this is the best movie to come out of michigan since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
<START> this movie tries to hard to be something that it's not a good movie it wants you to be fooled from begining to end but fails from when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you're just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it didn't br br
<START> yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villainsÂ how many more of these god awful cheaply and badly made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there for the record not that you will care really this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichÃ©s and predictability br br the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son br br the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry Â this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry Â in new zealand the acting is as wooden as the deck the script woeful the one liners predictable the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through br br there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time is there any chance of something at least half decently made semi believable and most important original no i thought notÂ
<START> what an entertaining movie astaire and randolph scott are in the navy astaire has to woo back ginger in san francisco while scott must be persuaded that harriet hilliard is worthy of being his wife everything works out fine br br it's sometimes argued and i can see why that scott's romance with hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down especially painful are hilliard's singing of sappy love songs i could have done without her singing right enough but i found the romance rather touching hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher wearing a pair of spectacles no makeup and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast no wonder scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister ginger and a slinky lucille ball the problem is that after her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before only with a glossier outfit it's tough enough for a homely guy but at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular then he can collect women anyway even if he looks like jojo the dog faced boy but what does a plain looking woman do the same avenues to romance aren't open to her henry kissinger had groupies did margaret thatcher it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours as a kind of a footnote i must mention that randolph scott was rumored to be bisexual by hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting homely hilliard off women don't interest me sister the movie probably gives more quality time to ginger rogers than any of her other films with astaire and she's marvelous she's beautiful sexy a talented actress and dancer and the script gives her good comic lines too let's kiss and make up suggests astaire let's just make up she says that will give you something to work on it's also the only film she made with astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition choreographed by hermes pan her performance is accidentally sabotaged by astaire who slips some alka seltzer or something into her water and she hiccups through her number burping being too indelicate for the time br br as a dancer i'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur but i think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film their first during a dancing contest let yourself go is the most wildly exuberant of any i can remember and the only dramatic duet let's face the music and dance must be among their finest the last step as they exit is startling br br i like the film for reasons with personal resonance i remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown san diego next to a shop called the seven seas that catered to sailors i was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of astaire and scott what i mean is here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality and yet unlike most of their other teamings pays its dues anyway jumping ship astaire calls out for a water taxi i had just taken a water taxi ashore myself the uniforms are correct to the period unlike say those in on the town and they're worn properly hats down to two finger widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back and there are two incidents in which astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable an officer stops astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain they were playing when the call was sounded sir i'm certain no breach of discipline was intended it's what an officer a good officer would say and nobody laughs br br the series was getting a little repetitious by the time follow the fleet was made so instead of putting fred into high society and a tuxedo they turned him into a gum chewing swabbie instead it was a good idea and the dance numbers are up to the concept
<START> a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo with a strong dose of erotica only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout Â actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people an acting troupe stranded on an island to which they were invited by a count Â since he had become enamored of the leading lady a dead ringer for his missing spouse the characters are pretty much stereotypes middle aged but dashing hero played by giacomo rossi stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy demure heroine sluttish companion recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot a meek but devoted stage manager forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior a couple of lesbians a mysterious gardener the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who for once gets in on the action if you know what i mean an envious housekeeper nominal star femi benussi though for what it is worth this is really an ensemble piece a religious fanatic of a butler an impressionable chambermaid etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing snail's pace shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black and white film and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half hour do not help matters besides marcello giombini's score though pleasant in itself comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here
<START> if i could i would give zero stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give one br br there is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didn't make me laugh either so if you're some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it 10 stars like some people here already did br br but for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my last br br 0 10 i'm ashamed of being from the same country as uwe boll br br please please keep him from making more movies
<START> i reflect back to the days when i held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when i was 16 the little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years now at my age i want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments that if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter but then again young people today are faced with some variables that i never had to deal with a youth br br the three main characters well played by all three actors kerry wahington lanisha anna simpson joycelyn and melissa martinez maria give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations they have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day the have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models these situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day they except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with finding true love in a male having good friends that you can depend on gaining some respect love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life this is were this film cross the race age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped br br the director and writer mckay explains on the dvd how each of scenes got into his head by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best the one thing i know about african americans and hispanics is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent this was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and i understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves br br the hope factor i now think about my future and where i have come from and say as lanisha did today is a good day ' yes poverty still exists racism sexism and any other ism that we can added yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self destructive everything around them is impoverished but none of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future i was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision i suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place br br
<START> here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race br br so what could we call this killing machine it's almost like he's some kind of destroyer or eradicator sort of like an exterminator or something what's the word i'm looking for something that terminates things hmmmm br br anyway the protector who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future born hero to be the evil uhhhh exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people's eyes and repeating her name threateningly br br then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable exterminator pursues the couple across the countryside at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle but i'm not sure br br perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then re emerge as strong as ever he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery and destroyed once and for all br br but maybe i'm extrapolating too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in 3 days br br the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant and career sweat hog stephen baldwin is also on board as young's fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe he's an import from a different james cameron movie
<START> i'll be quick to address the matters of the film here it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all consuming passions a young italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her jailed political radical fiancÃ© due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with the anxieties rage tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads it lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer unless you have a deep knowledge of italian politics during the 80's i found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it isn't simulated and leaves little to the imagination there are other scenes of sex in the film which i do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in but the oral sex scene i feel derails the focus on the actual story it was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears which caused much hoopla back in its day it's like hitting a roadblock it's jarring and unnecessary and i am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it and what's unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film which i believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext br br overall wonderful film hampered by a much not needed sex scene
<START> you can tell a lew grade production a mile off Â distinctly british in style epic in conception peopled by international all star casts usually set in exotic climes it's a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s resulting in titles like the eagle has landed firepower and raise the titanic in 1977 grade produced march or die a remarkably old fashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above directed by the usually dependable dick richards Â who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier march or die is an unfortunate disappointment br br a company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster gene hackman is sent to morocco shortly after world war 1 their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau max von sydow the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group foster is not happy with the assignment Â he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard catherine deneuve tags along with the legionnaires she is hoping to find out what happened to her father a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain terence hill a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature things climax with a huge battle at erfoud with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives br br on paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch Â hackman is the heavyweight oscar winning character actor hill the handsome but limited italian heart throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen yet bizarrely it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels the film is attractively shot on desert locations but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for maurice jarre's music is uncommonly flat too Â very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that peaked in the 30s and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades sadly the gamble doesn't really pay off Â this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march
<START> as a huge baseball fan my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears dennis quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much disney for my taste
<START> if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation mike myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his voice accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie
<START> clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a spanish american girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war it turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather she also makes friends and experiences much in a short time tomiche juan jose ballestra is at first a nuisance to her then they become close the film is shot beautifully bathed in soft colors mostly carol yearns for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love sher has for him while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it envelops the character's lives i think you'll like it see it especially for clara lago who does a great job as carol she is definitely one to watch
<START> tight script good direction excellent performances strong cast effective use of locations br br paul mcgann gives a detailed subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously br br there is an interesting moral emotional journey happening with his character ben turner and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton inevitably they cross over who has done what br br the examination of why both in the past and in the present rather than who might have yielded a more interesting dostoyevskian story but hey who's complaining br br
<START> this timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart so many years have i waited to see this eternal story i was not ready perhaps it is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power so i now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness br br my respect and admiration for paul muni has been long his is now a legendary luminescence but now i have finally discovered the priceless gifts of luise rainer's splendid talents oh how many faces can speak as did hers some have said that it was wrought from her silent years and this well might have been but her speech is eloquent enough when it is given a chance she amply deserved her oscar br br this movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions all parts equal necessary and perfect naysayers may walk away if they wish but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime br br the good earth enriches one in ways that one does not expect but all will not come from it with the joy that i did but i can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years br br do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players these are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection but i dare a million score of newer films to tell pearl buck's story with such poignancy power conviction and grace br br if any modern artist would dare to re film this masterpiece i warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness
<START> the eternal jew der ewige jude does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the film's logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as light skinned europeans thereby the text admits that so called hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach infested filth despite the supposed treasure they've hoarded and then flip flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldn't the use of scenes from a well known american film house of rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic first the film is denounced as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the rothschild character's spin is that jews are taxed excessively finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching for all of eternal jew's imperfections i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date i'd say the reason is that ej's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the film's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandist's tool about this time i should expect director hippler to flip flop once again springing forward to say that's what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate
