<START> pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard set in partition india this film shows the true reality of partition india urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go her freedom personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears the film at points is deeply traumatic some of the partition scenes are spine chilling yet urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling
<START> i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots all medium or close up shots no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination
<START> this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i can't recommend it at all if it didn't take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet
<START> well i don't think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be but there's no denying that it's got problems br br mostly the problems are in the script there's a plot but not much story and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible it trots out any number of self consciously strange and or stereotypical characters lines moments what have you and by the end it just hasn't added up to much in this department br br sorry but i couldn't care less about whatever social ill farnsworth might be trying to address there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia or whatever it is those morons do so as a film you won't find me calling iowa important but at a stylistic level the picture is more than interesting and some of farnsworth's choices in depicting a meth head's wigged out state are beautiful hilarious disturbing and yes i'm going to say it inspired br br the acting is uneven but that just may be a casualty of the afore praised stylistic reaching look rosanna arquette is a fine actress but she's not very good here so a discriminating audience member does have to ask what happened it's weird that diane foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near for example i might seriously consider whatever explanation farnsworth could provide for michael t weiss's over the top turn as a probation officer but i doubt i'd ever buy it it just doesn't work br br then again it's the most alive and in the moment that i've seen john savage appear in years so go figure br br this is the sort of work that tantalizes but does not promise and that's okay neither farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies so whether or not farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen but if he does it seems pretty likely that it won't be bland pap in an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of american idol perhaps we could allow not scorn farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably flawed film br br what is more perhaps we could welcome not berate his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination
<START> a visit by hitler in rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love friendship homosexuality and fascism sophia loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of hitler and mussolini she has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid she would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of il duce br br there is one exception though across the yard sits marcello mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide the reason he is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer the film really takes off when these two people meet by chance mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend loren frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands mastroianni and in a masterfully shot directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected the initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man this anti fascist this homosexual this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for br br this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed this is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism love ordinary people and most importantly the human condition despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement things will change someone has understood
<START> i expected a bad movie and got a bad movie but i couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was i don't even want to try to explain what blood surf is about is not about blood surfing but a big a crocodile they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws but spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end here the crocodile is shown a lot of times and it's the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen and they don't try to hide it if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid br br the director had an opportunity to make a decent surf shark movie but he had to make a bad b monster movie he had the chance to make an original surf movie but he wanted to make a monster movie so you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts not really it got some nudity and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie the acting isn't half bad either and kate fischer looks good too bad she doesn't take her top off the lead actors aren't bad either they had some potential the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes the blame is on the untalented writer and director the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen and the script is really badly written and the director got no talent what so ever and not much of a fantasy either br br don't watch it even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer it isn't worth it watch sirens to watch kate nude and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile action br br 3 10 because i'm in a good mood and maureen larrazabal looks good naked and kate looks good but is bad actress and dex miller joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh t they had to work with
<START> spin it br br the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite talespin the tv cartoon series that featured characters from the jungle book join baloo and kit cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before out of cape suzette to louie's up mountains through jungles on water in volcanoes looking for adventure looking for treasure looking for fun all in one action packed cartoon adventure br br this was a favorite of mine as well as my family's this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in 1995 which i have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in march 1997 br br and good news today the dvds are here relive the fun and excitement of dun dun dun talespin br br 10 10
<START> there are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe but are overshadowed with bad acting plot holes deus ex machina thrown ins stupid dialogs weak script and predictable clichÃ©s br br what we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time a group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first yeah that clichÃ© seems to be still very much alive even in finland seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital there are shrieking ghosts very imaginative zombies at one point i thought at least they didn't use zombies but they came and finnish glam rock band with demonic make up on getting in their way there is also some time shift doodle present but it adds up nothing to the storyline autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation but they never spell it out to the viewer or their confused friends their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like what happens will happen or light can't live in the darkness or the ominous i need a red crayon red crayon so all this characters including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types end up doing is running around them dark floors and from or mistakenly to the demons occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up and if it seems a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming towards it waving a flashlight and conversing it was just pretending and apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities br br in the end we even get a it was all a dream sequence twist or maybe it wasn't oh boy i wish this movie was and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so
<START> this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it or even better you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be amazing br br a good blend of comedy although not as great as mr magoo another one of my favorites and action this deserves 10 10 and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon fingers crossed if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours
<START> though not in the whole film andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv movie the plot is easy griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named mountains somewhere though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch this take it
<START> this documentary was interesting but it was also long so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes like ben hur long but if your into that this is for you but only if you have a passion for movies like i do being that martin scorsese is my favorite director live and maybe even ever this is quite fascinating especially if you know the style of scorsese's works because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films not the best documentary film ever made but it is a leap for scorsese which is always good to watch a
<START> there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december 6 1957 at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching which showed the vangard launch attempt which failed br br he is next shown reading or dictating a letter to dr von braun offering condolences about the failure br br von braun was at marshall space flight center in huntsville working for the army the vanguard project was by the early nasa team which was at what soon became goddard space flight center br br the army rushed the jupiter c which was essentially a us made v2 technology but worked to launch a satellite in response to russia's success with sputnik br br this error may have actually been made by homer because of the notoriety of von braun but his team didn't have their attempt fail in fact the underlying redstone was flying from 52 and was the first us man rated booster used for shepard's sub orbital flight as well as grissom's br br this is why this sort of movie is so good as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more
<START> a film without conscience drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money then they double cross him meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife and without her knowing he's the killer moves in with her then he accidentally kills her when she finds out then in a walking tall kind of heroism he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him the first problem is that by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment the drifter loses all sense of sympathy worthiness and heroism we can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center we just can't care about that kind of guy and the wife nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer the sheriff in eight legged freaks a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband and when she finds out he's the guy Â what does she do she locks him inside her house as if all houses had locks you can't open from inside with her and proceeds to berate him stoo pid george wendt however is terrific in a role as a beefy thug director stuart gordon did so much better with re animator and dagon
<START> i'm a fan of arty movies but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel agonisingly slow to develop a non existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
<START> over powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies check weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything check mobile suits based on angels check br br ok its a gundam series this one gundam wing has good character development real world complexity interesting ideas and some pretty eye candy br br with characters the initially weak relena dorlan later peacecraft then back to dorlan gets stronger and more independent although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy the series main character the aforementioned heero initially a cold hard butcherer becomes more and more human while still remaining in character and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise float between oz freelance and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations br br the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good reflecting how the real world works however in 49 half hour episodes it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential br br the ideas at the core of the series the necessity of fighting the desire for peace etc are ones that resonate even today in retrospect the series was ahead of its time what with the war on terrorism and all but its exploration of these ideas the monologues especially those of treize kushrenada is an incredible dramatic piece forming some of the best writing in the series br br but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge br br in terms of eye candy which is what this one has in bucketloads everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra no not the tampons you idiot is wells designed and explodes in big balls of orange which is bad because better animation would've had better explosions but who cares stuff explodes and thats all that matters br br in short though the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes you've missed out on a lot the poor writing can leave you cringing and sometimes the animation makes you go wtf but this is made up for in its classic animation style its scale sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations
<START> this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i wouldn't say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch
<START> life stinks 1991 was a step below mel brooks other productions he stars as a rich man who wages an insane wager with his friends brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual wager during his stay in the bowery he meets a bunch of odd homeless people one of them catches his fancy lesley ann warren they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street can mr brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich will he win this unorthodox wager who are his true friends find out when you watch life stinks to find out br br this film has been slagged unfairly sure it's not a classic like his earlier films but it's still enjoyable i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film if you have watched chaplin's earlier silent films then you'll get the humor as well br br recommended for mel brooks fans
<START> i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age 19 today what can i say i grew up in a house much like the one on full house i had a dad two sisters and a dog i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend also i grew up with my mom in the house i don't know what i would have done without full house on television i think that stephanie played by jodie sweetin d j played by kirk cameron's sister candace and michelle played by mary kate and ashley olsen are my favorite characters i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like steph i am a younger sister like michelle and i am an older sister like d j i really like how the show always has moral values because i don't really like any of the o c like shows today i like the comedy of full house too uncle jesse john stamos joey dave coulier and danny bob saget are hilarious as the girls' uncle dad's friend and dad respectively the story goes that after the girls' mom dies danny's best friend joey and his brother in law jesse move in to help raise the kids three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious each character on full house is full of heart funny and genuinely believable joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul jesse is the cool motorcycle riding tough guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces and later his wife becky laurie laughlin from summerville both kids and adults will love this show guaranteed
<START> vaguely reminiscent of great 1940's westerns like the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 red rock west is a story about conscience greed and betrayal michael nicolas cage is a down and out but honest young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money he finds both but not in the way he had expected br br the film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists excellent cinematography adroit film editing and moody western music add tension and suspense the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting and the acting ranges from good to excellent with great performances from dennis hopper and j t walsh dwight yoakam's specially recorded country western song provides the film with a strong finale br br correctly labeled as neo noir red rock west strikes me as being something else as well the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed ordinarily i would agree in this case however when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that beyond noirish is surreal it's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself from this point of view the coincidences are not script flaws at all they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons disguised as other characters br br all we need here is rod serling in a postscript explaining in his always clearly enunciated voice that a young man searching for himself stops in a small almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere it's his final layover in a journey to the twilight zone
<START> simple story why say more it nails it's premise world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing 2 of the survivors the message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place distilled down to representatives from each side we see they have everything to come together for br br security finding resources food shelter etc survival love br br at the end they've decided to pool their resources she finally does so they will survive simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable in the early 60s no one had seen such stuff i give it a 10
