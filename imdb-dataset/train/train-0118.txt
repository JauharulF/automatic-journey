<START> i don't care if you'd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn't good you're so obsessed by the films of hollywood that you can't see how good is this movie i'm not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think it's not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than usa in the world and it's good really good and it cost a lot to do it so please don't criticize the actors the directors cause you don't know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you
<START> for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making winchester '73 has something in common with casablanca while you watch it you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichÃ©s encountered so often in the genre then you realise that the clichÃ©s became clichÃ©s only after being copied from this particular film and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great in other words it's a seminal work br br winchester '73 is a joy to watch the broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you the dialogue the pacing and mann's direction are excellent stewart shines in particular and if you're a fan this is a must see but he is not alone in delivering a good performance remarkably many of the most thoughtful and or witty lines go to minor characters because this makes these characters much more than cardboard cutouts it lent additional realism to the film br br this is a remarkably underrated film and well worth keeping an eye out for the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film
<START> the best treasure island ever made they just don't make films br br like this anymore or ever no one makes films like this more br br than a novelty this film is funny frank and fascinating yet moody br br mysterious and morose this is one of my favorite pictures the br br director must have had some idea what it is all about but he br br certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations while leaving little left to the imagination why he br br has not made more films like this i have no idea while br br reminding me of some of the best noir it is one of a kind but this br br is not for the lazy or simple
<START> ghost story the tv movie 1972 was the pilot for the nbc series the movie was well written and well acted and i thought when the 1972 73 tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner i wish this film was available on video the series was a colossal disappointment even with william castle as exec producer if however you have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out you won't be disappointed
<START> this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame
<START> before i give spike lee's mess of a film summer of sam a well deserved thrashing i would like to make one thing clear i do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images what makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that lee seems to believe that summer of sam should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama the crime caper films of quentin tarantino for example are filled with violence profanity and other sleaze but are nonetheless highly watchable because tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art he knows that such films are for entertainment value only on the other hand serious dramas such as saving private ryan and schindler's list are often unpleasant to watch but the unpleasantness serves to develop the film's plot and characters with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen summer of sam unfortunately merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze while believing that it is serving as social commentary much like other trash epics br br summer of sam does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard cutout stereotypes its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the son of sam murders on the residents of the predominately italian american north bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred however instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities lee simply wheels out every negative italian stereotype imaginable the men are ignorant lazy oversexed goombahs the women are split between weak complacent good girls mira sorvino's dionna and promiscuous bad girls jennifer esposito's ruby lee seems to vindictively wants to payback hollywood for their years of negative african american stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own and few critics seem to care if martin scorsese for example presented residents of an african american neighborhood as a bunch of amos 'n andy and aunt jemima stereotypes critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping more importantly one dimensional stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary br br without exception the cast of summer of sam is excellent however the acting for the most part is uninspired the cast is either just going through the motions or they have little to work with scriptwise additionally there is notable miscasting comedian john leguizamo is very talented but his vinny character seems to be a stale comedic impersonation of john travolta's tony manero from saturday night fever and michael badalucco a perennial nice guy actor is badly miscast as serial killer david berkowitz coming across as funny rather than frightening the only performance worth paying attention to is adrien brody as the troubled but sincere neighborhood misfit ritchie the brody performance and the typically stylish lee cinematography are this film's only virtues br br 1 2 out of
<START> using tons of stock footage not only from trader horn but also the first two films in the series for example the alligator fight was used last time out this is one of the weakest films in the mgm series its a huge let down after the classic tarzan and his mate which is possibly the best film in the series br br the plot has jane's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she'll come back to claim it they are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will hiring a great white hunter who secretly wishes to capture tarzan and sell him the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles more so because of the stock footage after lots of talk jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of tarzan and jame making kissy face finally into the last half hour the plot to capture tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned br br painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film the middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere the last third where tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re shoot the film to me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good except at the end i would be hard pressed to explain it except i would have to say that it was the relationship between weissmuller and o'sullivan as tarzan and jane which kept people coming back its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples br br i should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the tarzan tree house i really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy if you can come in towards the end i would recommend giving the film a try otherwise i would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series
<START> this is not really a zombie film if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around here the protagonist armand louque played by an unbelievably young dean jagger gains control of a method to create zombies though in fact his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves this is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of 'dr mabuse' films including 'dr mabuse the gambler' 1922 and 'the testament of dr mabuse' 1933 here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancÃ©e claire duvall played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo dorothy stone which is really the major theme br br the movie has an intriguing beginning as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there at some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal clifford greyson robert noland it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact this would have been a great movie for 'mystery science theater 3000' if they hadn't already roasted it br br it's never shown how louque actually learns the 'zombification' secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards we won't see such sheer force of will until john agar in 'the brain from planet arous' 1957 br br finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america louque agrees but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers ' to gain her love he does so causing the 'revolt' of the title in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him greyson embraces claire and we seem to be at the end of a parable whom the gods would destroy they first make mad br br so really then it's not that bad of a film despite the low imdb rating it currently has on repeated viewings one can see the artistry in the well formed script dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness is that really his own hair we remember him more for his bald old man roles in 'white christmas' 1954 'x the unknown' 1956 and 'king creole' 1958 the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better earlier film 'white zombie' 1932 in which hapless robert frazier as charles beaumont uses 'zombification' to win the love of madge bellamy as madeline parker br br if you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds i'd start with 'white zombie' 1932 'king of the zombies' 1941 'i walked with a zombie' 1943 'night of the living dead' 1968 'the last man on earth' 1964 and its two remakes in the modern era of classy films there are 'horror express' 1972 'the serpent and the rainbow' 1988 '28 days later' 2002 and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mention br br this one is not really a zombie film judging this movie on its own terms it's more of a semi gothic romance as such it ranks a little below some of universal's bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s so i'll give it a 5
<START> when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many children's musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very well done which isn't surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very catlike and doesn't need stupid make up or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human and jason connery's so cute as the shy and awkward miller's son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable feature length movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he's drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as it's all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table he's a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a miller's daughter i'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it won't drive adults up the wall
<START> this is an unusual laurel hardy comedy with something of a split personality at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short happily each portion is funny in its own right and the boys' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film's disparate elements into an entertaining whole while i've never heard a fan cite dirty work as his or her favorite laurel hardy comedy it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like br br our story is set in the home of professor noodle who represents one key element of the story line a wildly over the top parody of mad scientist scenarios this marks a rare venture into sci fi territory for l h abbott costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan ollie in any event the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger while his sarcastic butler jessup expresses the viewer's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip meanwhile stan ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professor's home the very day he perfects his solution their portion of the film consists of characteristic but first rate slapstick involving the chimney the roof shovels and a number of unfortunate mishaps if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work but for fans of the team this movie is a feast the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney lands in the fireplace and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision one by one i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke the way w c fields' movies would feature the world's worst rear projection screens br br the slapstick stuff is great fun but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat prolific character actor lucien littlefield is terrific as the professor delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee while sam adams is a stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost so too usually did the background music of le roy shield but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits mood music might have enhanced the proceedings but no matter this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow and a prime example of what made laurel hardy so popular in their day
<START> this independent b w dv feature consistently shocks amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them it's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff yet as absurd as much of the film should be there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad that seems to be the heart of the film for as insane and off the wall as things get leon the 30 yr old paperboy protagonist always tries to keep it together he's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best so that everyone can have what they want br br the acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive van meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics just as the characters in the film do we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath br br majkowski is a true genius here he takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat it's a true testament to the skill of majkowski and all involved that this film with it's grating plot and characters never once works our nerves majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant and somehow given it heart and humor this is a unique film not to be missed br br
<START> another great movie by costa gavras it's a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in coups and support of latin american dictatorships br br despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist communist propaganda of the cold war era costa gavras is a well known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased for example he presents the us actions as brutal and inhumane while representing tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive br br as it turned out it was a blessing for uruguay and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes i never heard of poor uruguayan or chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most east european countries the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america and elsewhere but sometimes you need to play dirty this is not an idealistic world as costa gavras and matamoros like to believe had matamoros come to power in uruguay we would've had another ukraine in latin america br br all in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct
<START> i expected this film to be a run of the mill 1930's romance boy meets girl they fall in love boy loses girl boy wins her back in the end it wasn't like that at all clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby jean harlow 's apartment to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub no less instant chemistry she plays hard to get for a while but a girl can only resist that grin for so long the heat between them is evident and there are some scenes that are definitely pre production code when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for troubled girls she is miserable and thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her begins to believe that eddie will never come for her harlow plays the hard nosed fast talking ruby perfectly she never lets gable get all the good lines there is an especially moving scene with her playing their song on the piano that is acted perfectly the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time a truly sweet romance
<START> alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i can't help thinking i've seen it before reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called the other days of ruby rae also had specks of welcome to the dollhouse and ratcatcher and lynne ramsay in it's execution which is not to say that they're not tasteful references just that they feel very modern and very fashionable which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising as an approach in style and story than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come br br the cinematography is just too perfect for my liking too coral filter or charcoal for my liking too archly framed 12mm therefore the entire impression left me a little distant beware of art that proclaims itself too readily the french they are a conservative bunch seemed to buy it as did the jury however but cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although i wonder what's been happening in the last few years
<START> the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up residence he's being hunted by a female doctor turned vigilante who is out to exterminate him this female assassin who looks like a refugee from a motley crue video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monster's turf decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the island of dr moreau and yes it's worse than the one with val kilmer
<START> let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end it's one of those drama of life films as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive br br i liked the light and the girls the rest was without too much fault but without too much merit either i yearned for something like the interview or at least some matrix villain element here and there but nothing out of the ordinary the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close so not much of an effort to change things is required br br the smart american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film br br in the end i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life but to me it didn't seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn't seem attractive as a story br br i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie
<START> ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this didn't even really have one to begin with br br where to begin the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double glazing the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction br br add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope br br given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80's mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic 'daft' murder don't worry its telegraphed at least ten minutes before br br after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon br br it really is only a movie as they say
<START> a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie it's based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member in other words everyone br br though the production isn't quite hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill br br you don't want to miss this
<START> in the future of 2001 freddy is after the last surviving teenager of elm street forsaking any scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos come on roseanne tom arnold wtf this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got wow was this a piece of crap not even the great legendary alice cooper could make the stench of this movie go away and when they hell did freddy ever have a daughter the whole film is severely retarded in ever single conceivable way shape form rachel talalay you stink to high heaven babe br br my grade d br br dvd extras cast and crew bios jump to the 3d sequence and jump to a nightmare options more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of the nightmare collection dvd set br br dvd rom content trivia game screenplay and web link
<START> i saw this movie when i was little it was called glacier fox i was totally traumatized by it it follows a cute little fox family around the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics i won't tell you what happened but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the foxes i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die oh man this movie made me cry for hours it was a good movie i think i was really little and truth be told all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die rent it if you can but don't show your kids
