<START> after watching this film i was left with a two very annoyances about this film why did they make chen's character this mcguyver hit man and lee's character such an incompetent idiot chen's character's background is that he was raised in an underground cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant not only is he uneducated he is starving this is not a reference to chen's scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that chen is malnutrition ed unmodernized and has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort despite this situation chen manages to out shoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding chen's girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a 50 lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest by said chief br br now lee's character okay i get it he's depressed he's got some baggage but wow can he do anything right one moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again first scene he runs into chen and he manages to misses him from approx 15 ft multiple times toward the end of that scene lee watches chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds while holding a gun to chen face at a 10 ft distance even at the end of the movie lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again br br and my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with chen's character and that he is just killing to survive that would be a lot easier if i didn't just watch chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and lee others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill overall chen's character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride did i mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film my 3 stars go to some of the interesting director camera work who got in some nice shots br br bottomline one made for the nut hugging chen fans for me dog bite this dvd
<START> there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldn't be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses
<START> i didn't know what to expect from 'ned kelly' but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800's i've never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia's most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover highly recommended and that's from an aussie
<START> this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence only 82 minutes but it feels like it goes on forever even die hard van damme fans like myself should avoid this one
<START> this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right the plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book but really how many modern readers have read bleak house without seeing a film version first i know of only a few br br i think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who haven't a clue about the story did you actually see the series or did you just bag a bbc production because gillian anderson was in the newer version br br the series captures the mood pace characters and plot drivers cutting out the dickensian flourishes which aren't needed and detract from a film treatment like the turveydrop story the smallweed family dynamic and the extra lawyers tangle vholes etc are very truncated the only omission that i wish had been kept was the jellyby incident but as the first episode is already a trifle slow after the first episode the pace is perfect i can see it had to go br br the only other criticism i have is that jo's death could have been more faithfully done i can see that would have practically canonized woodcourt and he's kept a little more human for not having that scene but really i think jo's death is one of the most poignant points of the book and i missed it even though it always makes me cry br br has theowinthrop actually seen the series how did he think that esther was raised by her aunt and uncle who is this uncle i suppose someone who could mistake the name of denholm eliott for desmond isn't really an appreciator of english art film or literature br br i also think he mistakes the treatment of the law yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house it fails the descendants of jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation it fails the deceased tom jarndyce and rick carstone and all who have faith in the suit it fails miss flyte in some sense it also fails captain hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work yes it feeds the scavengers of vholes and tangle but it also makes men like guppy and kenge able to move beyond their station in life though not kind to social status climbers dickens clearly would have preferred that they weren't bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born contrast jo and the brickmakers' families to the climbing out of poverty by charley neckett br br also the law while misused by tulkinghorn and the chancery vultures is actually the source of security for the wards of the court ada and richard and for esther who is simply jarndyce's ward their security was ensured by the law which delivers them to jarndyce br br i can't see how anyone could have trouble following the story remember you aren't supposed to realize esther is lady dedlock's daughter right at the beginning neither are you supposed to get all the connections immediately instant gratification just doesn't happen in dickens br br as for seeing clearly through the fog gosh the gillian anderson had such scatty editing that i found it impossible to follow and i knew the plot already br br i found diana rigg absolutely brilliant overacting and drama don't make a good lady dedlock but if you think they do try the gillian anderson version br br it's ada and rick not kate and you get all you need of the rouncewell subplot

<START> first off i'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over the top a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think it's one of the better b movies tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the all important nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evil hotness especially towards the end as she's walking away from the engulfed scarecrow also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes it's a low budget b movie but out of all of them i've seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
<START> this video is so hilariously funny it makes everything else br br by eddie murphy seem very disappointing even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor which just goes to show you how good this really is to be honest i don't think that i've ever br br laughed at something as much as this including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse this show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long plus its extended version beginning with m but it didn't bother me see it the funniest thing i've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too
<START> edward montagne's tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor instead it's a poorly acted witless look into low budget and uninspired film making the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry grins and guffaws throughout and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government made filmstrip about driver safety the movie anticipates shows like 'leave it to beaver' and 'father knows best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in 1950 why the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie the only thing the movie has going for it besides its brevity is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor as the viewer is treated to well framed shots of new york city's interiors and expansive exteriors unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles i suggest watching practically any other movie
<START> brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom stephen dedalus and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june 16 1904 bloomsday a day to be celebrated double entendre intended bravo director strick screenwriter haines as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece gunter grass' novel the tin drum filmed by volker schlÃ¶ndorff 1979 is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with strick's film br br while there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film there are also recognizable characters although with different names in the novel for example buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon br br this film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings br br brian invinoveritas1 aol com 15 june 2008
<START> every movie from the thirties is dated but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others i e grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama with ford there's always the hard sell of someone's nobility abe the joads always the over emphasis of some heavy's badness always the poorly crafted awkward and obvious scripts this is no exception it's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment and sentiment is all this has going for it br br what ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of lincoln it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here ford went on to make decent movies this is too dated to be anything but bad it feels entirely false br br henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing 's ' or say shonuff
<START> secret of the lens is perhaps a pretty campy all time favorite of mine the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai ecchi anime i wish he did more campiness like this br br my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen the party riots that bill causes one of the funniest scenes and whenever my favorite character worsle appears br br check this out br br warning this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans
<START> i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy attempting to be a new millennium cross hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshall's sentimental direction and mark andrus' dark rather confusing screenplay the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel who have driven all the way from san francisco to small town hull idaho where grandmother georgia lives the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17 year old has become an incorrigible hellion br br the set up is clear enough but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees probably due to her off screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice lindsay lohan makes rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes as a petulant resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind she does what she can with the role on both fronts but her efforts never add up to a flesh and blood human being br br at close to seventy jane fonda looks great even as weather beaten as she is here and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon like dimensions of the flinty georgia the problem i have with fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one liners and maternal stares between this and 2005's execrable monster in law it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her it should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer dude as the naÃ¯ve harlan a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two year missionary stint cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lilly's husband an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending br br there is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple play role of the wounded widower lilly's former flame and rachel's new boss as town veterinarian dr simon ward laurie metcalf has a barely there role as simon's sister paula while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos some of andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd none all too exciting marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor there are several deleted scenes including three variations on the ending and a gag reel a seven minute making of featurette is included as well as the original theatrical trailer a six minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five minute tribute to marshall
<START> i agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content everyday madness but would like to specify that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women mostly categorized by age group there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the former's dress there is a middle aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor s a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having scratched his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the master slave couple after collectively abusing her threatening and humiliating the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer sun absolutely motionless sic unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong due to good visualization
<START> oh those italians assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes castles drowned in gothic atmosphere and back stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all if you've seen one film of this type you've basically seen them all the mst3k favorite screaming skull fits the mold too and the night evelyn came out of the grave is formulaic by the numbers and dull as hell even the luscious erika blanc is put to waste here br br zero 10 br br
<START> this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventive br br it's not scary it's not clever and it's not funny so what was the point of it
<START> when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra Âconservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated on a per capita basis europe britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society by doing so greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clichÃ© idealist left wing ideology this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash sensationalism at its worst anti usa garbage shameful
<START> i read that this did not well that the story is not solid that volckman feels he has failed in some way br br i disagree first it is well executed volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique but to have a focus that is worth thinking about would immortality reduce the value of life big question br br i can see he trying hard to build a feeling and he is not compromising this is to be applauded i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment i identify this film with this br br further it is much more interesting than richard linklater's roto scoping and volckman's story has more meaning than linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs old news everyone knows it but no one does anything about it renaissance has more to offer something new to think about and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better br br well done volckman really nice work
<START> louis creed a doctor from chicago moves to a large house near a small town since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine's along with him is his wife rachel and their two kids ellie and gage as well as ellie's cat church soon they met their new neighbor and old man named judd crandall judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house that is constantly a way used by big trucks but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children since she has traumas from her sister zelda's death br br during the first week of the family in the new house louis already has dead people to deal with victor pascow a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident addresses his dying words to louis personally even though the two men are strangers on the night following pascow's death louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles anyway he dismisses the dream many strange things starts to happen and church ellie's cat dies while walking on the highway louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church's death with ellie but judd sympathizing with him jud takes louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury church but instead of stopping there jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac ' indians ' there louis buries the cat on jud's instruction with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life and that is where the real horror story begins br br i personally find this movie very good it's not the most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies i watched the way gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a toddler it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral br br of course there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters things like that doesn't make any sense but i can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work br br a good thing i saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again all the nightmare began
<START> i've finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it the incubus is strictly by the number horror film unseen killer monster is raping and murdering women in a small town br br the film goes like this movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing surprising huh blah blah blah etc br br the film is totally predictable from beginning to end even the stupid big red herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character so when the shocking surprise ending arrived i wasn't shocked or surprised in fact it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie it's so silly br br anyway the film is so by the number that the rock band sequence is one of the few stand out moments in this dreary flick it's a stand out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually liked but aside from that there's almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus except that it's unintentionally hilarious
