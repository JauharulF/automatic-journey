<START> i want to say the acting is bad but i think it was the directing that made it so i never thought much of highlander same director but that one could be blamed on the 80s br br this one however has no excuses people get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him those kind of mistakes along with an unclear time line weird battle tactics sub par cutting and poor visual effects makes this one a sub par film over all br br then like so many other have commented all this american bullshit the german general being practically scared of his captured american private be prepared to swallow a lot of it although in small doses br br to sum it up a not horrible but still definitely sub par war movie in all aspects
<START> this movie is horrible in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way br br the storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that i'm not going to even bother describing it it's a sword sorcery picture has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world has a nomadic adventurer an evil aide sorcerer a princess a hairy creature you get the point br br the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter i don't know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel but when i caught site of gulfax i decided to stay and watch it until the end br br gulfax is a white furry creature akin to chewbacca but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within or that he's almost falling over although he isn't in the movie that much the few scenes are worth it watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson taking the solo chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level br br i actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere br br gulfax may look like sh t but he made this movie the only reason i've never seen the sequel or even sought it out was because of his absence perhaps should there be a final film completing the trilogy gulfax will make a much anticipated return
<START> the motion picture was in all likelihood made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era nevertheless this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak also gary cooper was probably just learning to act the result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards for 1931 maybe for 2004 not acceptable some of the actors performed well sadly the indians always get the short end in these early westerns they were living on the land long before the white man came but according to twisted history they had no right to defend themselves
<START> although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one it's an ultra low budget canadian film two it's written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless it's woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible br br in a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing don't waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention i'll never know
<START> oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child it s being shown on bbc 1 at half past midnight i wonder if yup it s a tvm br br you ve got to hand it to tvm producers not content on making one mediocre movie they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and nowhere to hide is no different the first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son sam ask why she divorced and being a tvm she answers that the reason is that people change rather than say something along the lines like i m a right slapper or your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex as does happen in real life divorce cases and it s young sam i feel sorry for not only are his parents divorced but he s as thick as two short planks actually since he s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you and unaware that i love lucy is painfully unfunny if only our own childhoods were so innocent ah well as orwell said ignorance is strength oh hold on sam is suddenly an expert on marine life is this character development or poor scripting i know what one my money s on and strange that sam the boy genuis hasn t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s but as it turns out during a plot twist it s the mother who s the dummy then there s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
<START> what a waste of time i've tried to sit through 'sky captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else anything else it's a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a first time director because it's stiff and i wanted to love it i love sci fi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie let's not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad it could've worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captain's director will keep getting work even after this dreck it's commerce not art
<START> fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat br br underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works br br donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and she's horribly burned in a fire he's reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br but abbey's never been one to give up without a fight and that's where the ec theme of the episode comes in cuckolded husbands and wives have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception if anything the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere br br and that's not to mention that john esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist you don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story until close to the end think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and you're there br br not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed as with most moh episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply
<START> one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about 10 which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it expect to see the usual askey murdoch banter so popular in its day with lots of interesting quirky co characters the lady with the parrot the couple due to get married and are in trouble from 'her' and my favourite the stationmaster nobody knows where it comes from nobody knows where it goes interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold ridley of dads army fame private godfrey the medic watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile
<START> for me this is one of the best movies i ever saw overcoming racism struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary cookie carl brashear is an amazing character to play who puts cuba in his best light best performance in his life de niro who is a living legend gives that something to the movie hated his character in movie but he gives so much good acting to this film great performance and appearance of beautiful charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie so if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery greatness who seek inspiration you must look this great drama my vote 9 10
<START> this movie is really not all that bad but then again this movie genre is right down my alley sure the sets are cheap but they really did decent with what they had br br if you like cheap futuristic post apocalyptic b movies then you'll love this one i sure did br br
<START> i have to say that the events of 9 11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers i was sick of hearing about it when this was aired on tv a year and a day later i was bawling my eyes out it was the first time i had cried since the attack i highly recommend this documentary i am watching it now on tv 5 years later and i am still crying over the tragedies the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing it was an accident and look where it got them these two brothers make me want to have been there to help
<START> yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing during the first 45 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sung through dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldn't help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film
<START> this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever ever but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop me and some friends then watched it admittedly whilst rather drunk it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill's last film at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no one could be bothered instead we watched the film right through at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed this wasn't a work of abysmal film this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at this was a film that anyone can enjoy this was genius
<START> shut it off the prologue with fu manchu's birthday and the opening credits of the assassins training is amusing then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with neat look for a cameo by cato in the beginning with a figurative wink at the audience
<START> decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision grade c
<START> black angel is minor whodunit with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance dan duryea the husband of the murdered woman decides to help vincent find the real culprit peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect this film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer never achieving anything special it is pleasant enough but then at some point it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big give me a break reactions that ending alone could have sank the film completely but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either vincent is a wimpy heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys i love film noirs but this one was a real disappointment
<START> its hollywood imitating daytiem soap operas at its finest its the fun that we never see great characters and great lines whoopi is hilarious sally field is so over the top gary marshalls lines are a riot this is what i love about good comedies never afraid to poke fun at themselves the sets were great wardrobe was on point and the backstabbing montana morehead was a devilish delight terri hatcher as dr monica demonico didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work soapdish is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd
<START> i'm sorry to report that i have seen this film several times when it bombed at the box office it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bad or was at that time i no longer watch so it might be wonderful now like samuel l jackson says about swine it might taste like sweet potato pie but i'll never know because i wouldn't eat the filthy mfer let's see dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert always a few steps behind moses it came out right after life of bryan so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth there's one scene where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert both of them dragged out and dessicated dying of thirst then they meet like old acquaintances who didn't really know each other very well promise to do lunch it could have been funny br br but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full king tut regalia he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe kid dyno wannabe or it might have been jimmy walker who knows who cares they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist very unfunny very long piece of excrement one of those legendary things that just won't flush no matter how many times you try so you leave it there for someone else to deal with br br well that's my review if you rent this movie don't buy it whatever you do prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of corona br br now that they've remade the poseiden adventure this one is probably high on the list for remakes maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time
<START> having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film br br the casting was excellent i loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places but this is a film the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does yes i thought andy macdowell was great i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities i find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion br br i loved the bit at the end where andy's character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that which i can personally identify with then there was that gorgeous classical piece nocturne i think by chopin which was a beautiful way to end bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessary br br i say well done to the film makers i have seen 1 000s of worse films
<START> yes marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running br br dresler is good never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen br br i watched this for polly moran whom i've seen elsewhere here moran is ok just ok as dressler's shrewish friend foe too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion br br the plot is good hearted bad guys try to rob the townspeople dressler triumphs and all ends well br br i do wonder about the central plot mechanism bonds this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly i however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them they're like stocks only different right it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity
