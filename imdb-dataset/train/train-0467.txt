<START> what can i say a kamal hassan movie being horrible he acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction in my kind opinion the director gautham menon must give up directing there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes there was no practicality in the movie gautham is just running out of stories but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well the villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family you will not get sleep seeing this movie however harris jayaraj again did a great job and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10 his song 'partha modail nallae' is soulful and soothing apart from that great cinematography on the whole this is just a bad bad movie kamal hassan i think should have rejected this movie
<START> women they're all scrubbers br br no not a good translation not at all this lags behind the previous year's dad's army entirely missing the special small screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline and more precisely even than that a british film industry entering decline and that is hardly a recommendation is it to be an exemplar of saddening folly br br all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been surgically stripped away by cliff owen galton and simpson are endless dilapidated musical cues yawn from the ron grainer theme bolstered sentimentality that shoddy thick eared ending how much bolder does the second steptoe film seem in comparison an increased seediness with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely fully applicable to something like the 'misbegotten monstrosity' yours truly on this site from 1973 the mutations there is a strangely botched cut adrift tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a rugby club that i partly hate and recoil it so far as a friend intimated from the mood of the tv series but this at least seems an original slant and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the britain of 1972 there is however an implied prostitute aye of a 'heart of gold' who turns loose woman traitor 'pon poor auld 'arold and beyond caricature writing of the 'class' element not to mention surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads brambell and corbett collude with the script and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham what would anthony aloysius hancock have made of it all i will merely concede that a few moments just about work chiefly those where g s play things a little more carefully and b c touch tenderer nerves and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair br br but and oh how this pains me to say it it is tiresome boring both wilfully detached from reality and what made the tv series great and also fully in tune with the lazy tawdry misogynist 'fuck it that'll do ' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film making in the britain of the time
<START> a mediocre sci fi channel original picture a little squirmish but not much the nuclear powered submarine u s s jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels a member of the crew simmone jade mackinnon thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters but is not given much chance for vague reasons also among the crew are david keith mark sheppard and sean whalen this movie could have been somewhat better if the eels monsters were not so cartoonish
<START> having lived in ontario my whole life in the same town that marlene moore grew up in i've heard stories of her from my parents grandparents and family members so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her and that the beginning would be shot on my street and her house quite close to mine i was excited br br if you read the book rock a bye baby which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child with the exception of one of her brothers also if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to br br marlene did not deserve the life she was given with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did i still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self defense from a man who tried to rape her as her brother once said they didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her i believe in that with all my heart br br rest in peace marlene you deserve it so much
<START> as peckinpah did with straw dogs and kubrick with a clockwork orange director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s burt reynolds jon voight ned beatty and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls one big dead lake br br but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods and the following day continuing on down the river beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted the film's infamous squeal sequence by two vicious mountain men bill mckinney herbert cowboy coward thus what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism br br james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker often known for its squeal and dueling banjos sequences deliverance is also quite a pulse pounding ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times a must see film for those willing to take a chance
<START> this is a really interesting movie it is an action movie with comedy mixed in foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next it was a well shot movie the director used the right colors in this movie dark blue colors to give it the right kind of feel kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen she plays her role well even jamie kennedy is in this movie it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan it deserves more credit than it is actually given
<START> i really love this show it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more it gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendship throughout the years after each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that one the show was good you can't wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years and two the fact that the show has been put on hiatus and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety fox obviously do not know what they have done they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 49 category they clearly do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as reunion i have one query though that i would like to raise if they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years your answers are most welcome bring back reunion bring back reunion
<START> mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that's more interesting than the movie itself this was chaplin's tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first two reeler here he played one of his last out and out villain roles although the feature length tillie's punctured romance was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself in fact chaplin's conflicts with director and co star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio br br chaplin hadn't gotten along with his earlier directors henry lehrman and george nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn't know what to make of him but everyone loved mabel producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer's films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a s a p so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it br br unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel which looks like typical keystone chaos the story concerns an auto race in which mabel's beau harry mccoy is scheduled to compete but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and mabel must take the wheel in his place for all the racing around brick hurling and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest there's some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there aren't really any gags just lots of frantic activity chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance making a living but the outfit suits the old fashioned villainy he displays throughout at least it's novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get up and a more characteristic mack sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine as a performer sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked these films were hugely popular in their day mack's performance doesn't add much to mabel at the wheel but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn't kill each other
<START> i ordered the movie from korea because i was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out br br having watched it i can say that i am ashamed to have had any part of it i feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of british comedy br br from beginning to end the film is predictable tedious dull monotonous and cringe worthy to the point that on several occasions i actually looked away from the screen in dis belief until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un romantic and un comedic a romantic comedy can be br br it's not only a bad story but a badly made film in one scene you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the s a 's when to wipe across i will post details of this in the 'goofs' section br br on the up side it did fill me with emotions disappointment rage embarrassmentÂ
<START> wow what a waste of acting talent my husband and i sat there both thinking this has to get better these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap unattractive characters hackneyed script and listless pacing make for a long two hours i actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping cat litter being more appealing than this film the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't get better by the time buddy is killed you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives it would be infinitely more entertaining beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive
<START> this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually non existent the acting affleck in particular is poor at best ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family blah blah blah
<START> a craven cowardly film director boorman shows cahill burglarizing rich houses but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny thats all right then the forensic scientist investigating cahill is blown up in his car but he is rat faced sourpuss and doesn't look like a nice man so thats all right too the beits owner of russborrough house made their money by exploiting 'darkies' digging up diamonds so it's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the wicklow mountains the garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder the moral equivalencing is sickening boorman looks for a hit film but doesn't have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang who terrorized the neighbourhood and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon dublin he even liaised with the generals son while making it disgusting shame on him for his cowardice
<START> surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end for the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one with a small budget insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it br br it's silly that with all the money going around in the christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with i'm not a religious so i couldn't care less really but film making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance in that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity br br the low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down it makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy b movie like feeling br br but what's hurting this movie more is its writing the stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then i'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story the way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers br br i also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up i just couldn't cared less really at times br br still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end when its story gets more focused on its essence still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned there are far worser one to watch out there though i don't think this movie will win over any new souls br br 4 10
<START> in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv dietrich bonhoeffer's life is a true example about a good german and specially about a good man the conversations between tukur's character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting a true ideas' war two different germans both with faith in there believes bonhoeffer was a very complex person man freedom fighter boyfriend churchman and a great intellectual ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer i recommended this film a lot specially in this difficult times for the planet in mexico we don't know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero
<START> this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of 2 failed scripts br br its characters are just an assembly of characters with clichÃ© tragic or comic attributes the sum total of which is neurotic dialog like only woody allen could write woman love this because its like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this film probably br br this movies was not enjoyed by me however because there was no car chase and also the film didn't have any fights there was also no drug lords or gang bangers not to mention a lack of snakes this film had no snakes not my cup of tea and maybe not yours ether so think about what i have said before you find yourself watching this film br br unless of course you resemble a female have weight issues man issues enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this is meaningful for you
<START> fatal error is a really cool movie robert wagner antonio sabato jr janine turner jason schombing malcolm stewart and david lewis are in the film the movie's cast all acted really well robert wagner played his role good the relationship between saboto jr and turner was a nice one there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple the two actors really worked together rather well the music in the film is really good by ron ramin and fits the flick very well there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end if you like robert wagner antonio sabato jr and janine turner then watch this excellent movie
<START> well this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to entertain his films generally aren't deep but they are often entertaining enough my super ex girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain it's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that when you strip away the super girl stuff you're left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad it's a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they could a slice of life with a twist
<START> pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very good at what he does but he's getting old and tired greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see
<START> this movie makes several mistakes a few american actors in spain and the spanish actors speaking english the 'spaniards' english is ok but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying the dialog through the whole script is very weak it may have been a spanish script but translated incorrectly who knows and who cares i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language they may be good but not in this flop you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes thats how pathetic it is then the rest is just bad lots of waste of time lots of un necessary plots oh did i mention one of the baldwins' is in this
<START> well it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said but the thing is i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen so i have to write something br br the acting is stupid it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be don't they realize that even rip offs can still be scary we don't see how the granpa is killed the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die you just don't sympathize with them and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better we just hear him scream and we see nothing
