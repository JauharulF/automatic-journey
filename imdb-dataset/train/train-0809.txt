<START> i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we don't read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all 8 movies please don't change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all 8 movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we don't get that enough anymore awesome job
<START> this is one of the oddest films of the zatÃ´ichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film interestingly enough this was the first zatÃ´ichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company now instead of just playing the blind swordsman katsu is in charge of making the films this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films as far as ichi's role the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual he's also easy to fool and actually for a while does a lot to harm people instead of helping br br zatÃ´ichi rÃ´yaburi begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness oddly in this scene ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8 this is a minor mistake and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed br br this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year so you can see what i said about odd pacing most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks ichi comes to a town where there is a boss asagoro who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man at the same time he meets another boss shushui a sort of guru to the poor shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching giving up his blade for many months shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china non violence and acceptance of life as it is for good or for bad br br months after leaving this town and thinking all was well ichi learns that as soon as he left asagoro showed his true colors enslaving women oppressing the poor and being an all around jerk in a way ichi is responsible for this as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend now asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions br br when ichi returns he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where what else ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui this finale was very good and occurred in the rain then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards br br pluses for the film are that although poorly paced it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 which often seem very similar additionally it does end very well minuses aside from pacing are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat very very very flat they are tacky and unfunny that's the sort of flat that it is
<START> while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit uniforms bands parades two outsiders stay home in a large building and wind up meeting she is sofia loren who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children he is mastroianni a radio speaker who's been fired because of his homosexuality both of them need company and understanding both f them find it in each other br br the movie covers a span of a few hours the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers strangely enough the nazi anthem the horst wessel lied ends up becoming a romantic musical theme br br beautiful movie excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching sad story mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job very far away from her usual truck driver's pin up neapolitan fishwife personas don't miss it
<START> this is a great movie it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government this isn't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti the reason this coup against chavez didn't succeed is chavez was elected with over 90 of the vote br br this movie isn't just a political documentary it would still be a great movie if it were a drama it's amazing that this is real br br the other reviewer is lying when he says chavez seizes the airwaves the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time
<START> i can fondly remember bo derek's heyday and the uk press attention the mucky sun news of the world papers especially all following her small role in 10 with dudley moore understandably much fuss was made of her photogenic face crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts br br unfortunately acting is and never was her forte i think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain dvd bins orca tarzan the ape man and bolero all these films could be nominated for the so bad they are great br br it would be a guilty must buy of mine should you ever read your press or this comment ms derek please do not be offended always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability much love x
<START> i've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you're looking for stirring shakespearian dialogue this is true unfortunately because all the stirring dialogue this wonderful play contains has been cut and replaced with songs i've read this play and recently was lucky enough to see it performed at it remains one of my favourite shakespearian comedies but this movie seems to take all that i like about it away the princess though no doubt doing what she was directed to do had no regal bearing and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters also affected by unwise cuts which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue but took comments out of context it was a little unnerving to hear the princess proclaim we are wise girls to mock our lovers so when mocking had not taken place at all the news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow and took away many excellent scenes as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern phrasing in conclusion an excellent play ruined by an odd concept and unwise cuts kenneth i usually love what you do what were you thinking
<START> why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with prom night the amityville horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasons br br it's a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do it's clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and i'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the original br br one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel brittany snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style br br when the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna br br who will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis co star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thing br br without much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump scare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there haven't been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue br br in the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that movie br br my final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack job remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night you'll be in a hurry to forget
<START> as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been br br the bad i'm a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator br br the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and that's too bad you can tell things aren't right with the story i couldn't get involved with treat williams' portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasn't in this movie it's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy too br br not everything was disappointing i can't complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona br br i'd like to see this movie re made and done better because it is a one of a kind story
<START> times are tough for angel town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic kick boxer olivier world's lamest actor gruner named jacques hope is on the way angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made and i've seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are french kick boxers who can't act worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is to wit you like the fighting olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock i could kill him right when i want him dead he dies the reason why i don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me that's why he doesn't die br br of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation odd br br however don't let me make this sound that i hated this movie far from it it's so terrible it's priceless the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gang members who the film's biggest logic gap decline the use of pistols also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while gruner kick boxes the rest all of this set to the sound of horrible mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this br br the other treat about this movie is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend in a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you on the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details ain't no mercy in angel town br br out of 4 bad
<START> originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bug's life was too much too fast he was dazed and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completely br br okay first off i'm 26 years old have a job go to school and have a fiance' so maybe i'm nuts and just really good at hiding it but not only did i not come away from a bug's life exhausted or dazed it wasn't until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals because the first time i went to see this movie i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being wowed by each frame visually how can you not empathize with flik and his road to heck paved with good intentions life heck indeed i found myself identifying with that little ant not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than one and that in itself says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy of course it's beautiful every blade of grass the tree the rain of course what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips try it but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color no a bug's life would be static if it were all that and no story but i'm glad to say it's not a bug's life has real heart yes there's a lot going on storyline wise as well as visually but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door kids are smarter than you think besides that i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves even before their kids and it shows in the amount of heart in has this movie is moving touching funny intriguing and generally engrossing the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing there's a major amount of character growth and not just of the main character so rare in animation and often in movies in general it doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them every scene every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there and there are no gratuitous shots not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety to me folks it means not dumbing down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid which it mostly is not all i can think is if you can see a bug's life and not feel anything at all then you must have never made a big mistake hurt your friends had a crush fallen in love been frustrated that no one would listen to you lied to someone you care about felt like a social misfit gotten excited over a new idea come up with a great idea had what you thought was a great idea backfire been awkward one moment and confident the next felt the pressure of responsibility stood up for yourself and your loved ones stood alone against the crowd felt like a failure felt like a big success felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others well you get the point final words a rating from me please if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie if you loved toy story you'll most likely love this pixar knows how to make movies with heart if you do love it see it multiple times or you still won't know what you're missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable and whenever you're feeling really low just pretend it's a seed okay
<START> actress ruth roman's real life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump started this all star warner bros salute to patriotism and song many celebrities make guest appearances while a love hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal ron hagerthy who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew flying to and from honolulu you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant roman is also here looking glamorous while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone jane wyman sings too in a hospital bedside reprise following doris day's lead causing one to wonder did they run out of sets for undemanding viewers an interesting flashback to another time and place still the low rent production and just adequate technical aspects render starlift strictly a second biller 1 2 from
<START> somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash tv phenomenon there are dozens of famously bad movies e g manos the hands of fate that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary witless waste of film br br seriously why not a documentary about the jerry springer show that would begin to answer some of the real questions like who are these people what happens to their lives after they appear on this show how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself here br br one good line during an orientation session for guests people i can't emphasize this enough no weapons
<START> this film deals with the atrocity in derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday br br the film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful white wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with br br overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is
<START> one of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat' for example and randolph scott seems out of place br br there are compensations it has some of irving berlin's choicest songs including 'let yourself go' 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance' it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here they do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film great versatility and artistry br br it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role she had a varied career becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie here she is touching without being sentimental her two songs are simply and effectively delivered she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film br br more tightening up have made the film even better pretty good though
<START> if this movie were any worse it would have been directed by uwe boll this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile but i do remember that i wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved how anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe i give it one star because there is not a rating lower all copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste no one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it
<START> this movie is extremely boring it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life nothing exciting ever happens the director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life i had to watch other films by this director for a class the others were not as boring this film was also watched for an assignment it better be worth the boringness with a good grade overall unless it's required don't watch the film but don't discount other films by this director because they're not as bad and don't discount other films about africa they're usually good especially when done by a western director
<START> i just viewed the film two days ago and i was filled with anticipation being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 months there in the '80's i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes while original and artistically done did not capture the light and beauty of the city very well nor enough of the romance we saw none of the tree lined boulevards there was too much darkness not only literally but figuratively some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed and let him her down flat the marais sequence the coiffure salesman sequence to give two examples the uplifting good ones the mime sequence the cemetery the montmartre though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend the cowboy vignette and the sacre coeur seemed few and far between and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more
<START> the only reason i watched this film was because i had recently read robert hough's less than perfect but interesting fictionalised account of the life of big cat trainer mabel stark beaty appears as a character in the book in a less than flattering light br br i hadn't realised until checking the movie out later on the imdb that it was originally a serial whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on dvd has done a hell of a good job the shortened version plays just as well as any b movie of the period despite the many 'duh what ' moments for instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty looking over the chapter titles i see that number five is titled gorilla warfare and number eleven is called the gorilla there were no gorillas at all in the movie i guess that's where some of the cuts were made br br historicaly interesting
<START> the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes craven's 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor clawed maniac turned jokester yelling stupid one liners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a super dumb 'eerie' children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an over load of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 3 10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddy's dead which is awful beyond belief in case you're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint
<START> well what can i say about this movie i'm speechless i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that really pi sed me off was the music and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it to them all i have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time fistsof fury starring bruce lee if he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape i say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film i now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it the only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity what is this world coming to
