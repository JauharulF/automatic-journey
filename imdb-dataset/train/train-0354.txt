<START> i saw this movie twice i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie i'm also a movie theatre director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty images br br what most of romanians don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers pintilie should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu
<START> this installment of masters of horror was terrible apparently mr carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent plausible dialog there were times when i literally shouted at the tv for something to happen maybe he thinks he building suspense but carpenter needs to trim back that overdone over simplified musical score of his or his son's and advance the action a little bit how many times did the girl say oh no i can't have this baby and oh no here it comes carpenter takes elements from much much better films assault on precinct 13 and the thing and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style what is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy it's as though he's sleepwalking through the process of movie making br br for better carpenter films stick to the tried and true classics the thing halloween and they live for better masters of horror episodes check out my personal favorites family jenifer and dreams in the witch house
<START> quite simply the best reality show ever made the first two seasons the only ones that matter are on hulu i challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it i guarantee you will finish watching the season then i guarantee that you will watch season 2 br br other quick reasons to watch it 1 anderson cooper is hilarious 2 the locations in europe are awesome 3 the games are mentally challenging 4 it's very interactive 5 in one episode a player responds to another player's desperate i'm trying as hard as i can with an equally desperate not necessarily br br can you figure out who is the mole
<START> the pre release version of 1933's baby face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment mentored by a nietszchean professor lily powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except lily's childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father the destructive relationship with her father suggests lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate while lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancÃ©s to trade jobs for sexual favors perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women br br the plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the faÃ§ade of the office building as lily climbs ever higher barbara stanwyck reveled in tough hard bitten roles and she is in top form here sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung only her african american confidante chico receives lily's affection trust and loyalty in more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of theresa harris who plays chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her stanwyck often appears overly made up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to harris however despite stanwyck's tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including douglass dumbrille donald cook and a young john wayne br br the preferred version of baby face is the 76 minute restored cut the edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit perhaps darryl zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from nietszche whose views on women were controversial however despite alphonse ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor however the philosophy is but a distraction short fast paced and entertaining baby face is as contemporary in its morality as wall street substitute gordon gecko for nietszche and lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good
<START> this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13 didn't really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 on video of course i now own it was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed
<START> those of you who like me were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of morty the mannequin monster made of wood here is a brief overview br br twenty years after mike hawthorne gordon currie in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of ridding his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents' home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the mannequin morty according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear what mike doesn't know is that morty is possessed with his father's spirit and begins killing off the friends or is it really mike himself doing the killings who cares br br a have a few troubles with this film the first lies with morty i thought the original made morty look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious morty is a man actor jon fedele in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where morty is still supposed to be inanimate but if you watch closely you can see him blinking another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough some of them do namely betsy palmer of friday the 13th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either uncreative unseen or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasn't too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesn't help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night zanatos' score 4 out of 10
<START> to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever made br br from beginning to end it oozes class it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples br br the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy br br no matter how many times i watch the film and i have watched it a lot it never fails to touch me it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry it is as fresh today as it was in 1946 br br if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film
<START> i have never seen a show as good as full house full house puts all of the newer shows to shame big time anyone who has never seen it which i don't see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age full house will make you laugh it will make you cry it will amaze you true some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out weigh all of the cheesy aspects full house ran it's first episode on september 22 1987 entitled our very first show and ran it's last episode on may 23 1995 entitled michelle rides again part ii br br the plot of the show is very believable danny tanner bob saget losses his wife pam in an accident involving a drunk driver danny has his brother in law jesse katsopolis john stamos which is pam's younger brother and danny also brings in his best friend joey gladstone dave coulier to help him raise his three daughters danny's daughters are named dj candice cameron bure stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate and ashley olsen joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran for br br the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor actress who played him her john stamos jesse john stamos is a great actor he plays jesse jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break in full house john stamos does a great job portraying his character he looked and played music like his idol elvis presley br br bob saget danny bob saget is also a great actor he looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver he has to raise three girls without a having the girl's mother bob saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls br br dave coulier joey one word can describe dave coulier funny he is great playing the character of joey was perfect for him he does a great job playing the stand up comedian waiting for his big break br br candice cameron bure dj she is a tremendous actress she plays the oldest sister dj which is short for donna jo she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen her acting ability in full house was very believable br br jodie sweetin stephanie two simple words can describe jodie sweetin incredibly amazing i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about jodie but i would use up the 1 000 word maximum just on her she got her start in a kids show called mother goose stories and when she came to full house she blew the audience's and creator's mind her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was according to dave coulier jodie was supposed to be the star of the show it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly she showed great enthusiasm most young kids can't do this as you can probably guess jodie sweetin stephanie is my favorite character in full house br br mary kate and ashley olsen michelle great actress full house is where they got their start they received the part of michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera br br there are many more cast members that should be recognized these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987 br br the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end i think it was to focused on her towards the end especially when i think jodie and candice were much better at acting br br full house is a great show for everyone it can teach you a lot one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as loosing a family member occurs full house continues to attract new fans with all this said there is only a couple things left to say full house will never die and thank you the cast of full house for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy
<START> this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage the main characters are the whiny non hero kevin amy his bratty ungodly conservative girlfriend kyle a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex daphne a scrawny horny girl who is supposed to be cool and has no sense of how to dress and her oversexed boyfriend nick an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything no i'm not a pervert that's really how the movie goes the movie itself is an over sexed rip off of 1986's gremlins only you'll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere no these hobgoblins unleashed by wimpy man i'm sorry kevin make someone's wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims yes you guessed it eventually they wind up in a strip club where the nerdy amy's greatest dream is revealed she wants to be a stripper look i watched this flick via mst3k and even with mike nelson tom servo and crow t robot making a laughing stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes not really but i wish i had i'm not giving you anymore plot because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain besides it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning they should put a surgeon's general warning on this film
<START> we could still use black adder even today imagine rowan atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful hugh laurie hugh is sensational as the dimwit prince george and edmund as his brilliant assistant i love the episode which kenneth connor guest stars as a british thespian every time edmund says macbeth the two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits it's the funniest things that you will see of course none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without ben elton and richard curtis who are also behind the films like love actually the thin blue line four weddings and a funeral black adder is funny and almost too good for television humor can be smart sexy and funny all at one i was hoping last night on saturday night live that hugh laurie would pay homage to his background in british humor if the gang at snl did some research they would know what a treasure it was to have hugh laurie grace their stage
<START> i've said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damn br br the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco which i love and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making however it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned plotted film spoiler for crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing ok they have one but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place conran misses the point of having a villain as far as action goes well let's see sky captain law shoots down one robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before dex ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and law's lack of chemistry is so right and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she only has two shots left both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although i saw it coming from 70 years away no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen and that's the movie's real flaw an audience doesn't identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate without that plus a good engaging story all the cg in the world won't help
<START> this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i've ever seen i laughed so hard i'm sure i missed half the jokes this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is what i particularly like is that he seems never to be dumbing down the material for his audience his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags thumbs way up
<START> bo derek might have had a career had she not let her late husband john take over as her director it's a real shame no really with the right direction and the right part see 10 bo was okay she wouldn't win any awards even at her best but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone but therein lay the problem john was determined to ride the wave that bo created with her appearance in 10 that of bo being the perfect 10 the hottest woman in america the sex symbol of the 1980s problem is in john's hands this wave crashed with a resounding thud in only a few year's time maybe he knew her limitations as an actress perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body not her acting skills but it got old real quick it didn't help matters any that the films of john and bo derek are let's be honest really really bad and bad sums up their take on edgar rice burrough's literary icon the lord of the jungle tarzan of the apes br br you know what's worst this film is boring make me laugh make me cry just don't bore me not even bo's stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest and that is what the film is of course built around richard harris god bless his soul he and bo were previously in orca btw hams it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and miles o'keefe makes a physically impressive tarzan maybe he got the last laugh after being hit with a ton of venom from the critics over this film miles went on to a solid career as a b movie icon in films that were not great art but a million times more fun than this one but other than that it's bo's body and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it tarzan the ape man has nothing else john derek was a truly dynamic actor he was not a director he should have stayed with his strength this film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes burrough's tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment who wouldn't want to be as agile strong and good looking as lord greystoke and fun you get none of that here watch it and you will have wasted 107 minutes of your life on second thought you may come away with a valuable lesson how not to handle someone's movie career br br bo derek is all right in my book though she stood by john until his dying day has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight she has also proven that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be if she could survive tarzan and bolero she can survive anything so come back bo all is forgiven br br and as an aside is the steve strong who plays the bad guy the same steve strong who a brief pro wrestling career
<START> this is absolutely the worst trash i have ever seen when i saw it in the theater arghhh it took 15 full minutes before i realized that what i was seeing was the feature not a sick joke
<START> this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second after steven spielberg's columbo murder by the book it's also at the same time among one of the better ones br br bernard l kowalski was one great creative director no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style passion and eye for detail every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie it's definitely one of the better directed columbo movies br br it's a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act so the killer this time doesn't have any time to plan out the 'perfect murder' in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer's trust this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets set up i liked the story of the movie and how it progressed br br it also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one mrs columbo episode only in totally different roles he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie as the husband of the victim br br all in all a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies br br 9 10
<START> don't even bother with this movie it's bad when judged on it's own merits but when compared to the 1972 original which is a classic it's down right awful and btw somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book this is silly movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from they are 2 completely different art forms as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does if you used this criteria for all movies then 2001 would suck and so would forest gump and silence of the lambs
<START> action comedy suspense this movie has it all br br the plot goes that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a heist in a small town in montana every type of crime movie archetype character is here frank the master mind carlos the weapons expert max the explosives expert nick the safe cracker and ray the car man unfortunately for frank he is apprehended by 2 bumbling detectives portrayed very well by ed o'niel and daniel roebuck that have been chasing him from new jersey write after he sends out the letters to the other 4 br br our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust one another added to the mix is the fact that frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together br br now frank is being taken back to new jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own br br truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
<START> serum starts as eddie derek phillips is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an md like his father richard dennis o'neill his uncle eddie david h hickey however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident is run over by a car taken to the nearest hospital it doesn't look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing br br executive produced written directed by steve franke i'll be perfectly frank myself say serum is awful serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to rip off other any number of other's ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers the script is terrible it has the whole re animator 1985 feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but it's so boring it's untrue the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away finding his ex girlfriend has hooked up with someone else arguments with his step mom getting drunk with his mate generally boring the audience stiff so once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie re animated then he kills a couple of people police catch up with him shoot him the end thank god serum is devoid of any of the characteristic's that one would associate with a good film the character's suck the dialogue is poor it takes itself far too seriously it's dull it's slow it's forgettable considering it's meant to be a horror film there's an alarming lack of blood gore or horror not recommended did i mention serum was boring i thought so br br director franke does nothing to liven this thing up although competent there's no style here at all the gore levels are none existent there's a bit of splashed blood a bitten neck a couple of scars on a dead woman's face a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin that's it don't expect a re animator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed much like i was in fact filmed in what looks like one house one restaurant a lab the film has no variety either just looks cheap throughout there's a couple of scenes of nudity but that's nowhere near enough to save it br br technically the film isn't too bad at least it looks like proper cameras were used i can't really comment on the special effects because there aren't any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional apparently shot in texas or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actor's rather than friends or family of the director br br serum is a terrible film it's dull slow boring has no gore feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes i don't understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch re animator or one of it's sequels again instead seriously i recommend you give serum a miss there i've just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life you can thank me later
<START> woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better but it would be hard he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda not quite so tired and so unfunny his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen is it still our good old woody the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy than we begin to see the two points of view both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex husband in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together or make you laugh more than once or twice there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year
<START> wow alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run unearthed films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go i've seen it all almost every horror film known to man argento fulci bava buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place this review is for the devils experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the devils experiment not only delivers but that's all it is pure unadulterated violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released br br i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place the devils experiment is not for everybody it's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life
