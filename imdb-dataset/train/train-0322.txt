<START> this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac 2007 and got this one by accident thought it was a joke before the actual movie this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer the filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings they only liked the name so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name i am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner i try to like something out of every movie i don't hate movies ever except this one if you could have given it no stars i definitely would have 1 out of 10
<START> back when alec baldwin and kim basinger were a mercurial hot tempered high powered hollywood couple they filmed this nearly scene for scene remake of the 1972 steve mcqueen ali macgraw action thriller about a fugitive twosome it almost worked the first time because mcqueen was such a vital presence on the screen even stone silent and weary you could sense his clock ticking his cagey magnetism baldwin is not in steve mcqueen's league but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor if so this is not a showcase for his attributes basinger does well and certainly looks good but james woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob magnet role a sub plot involving another couple taken hostage by baldwin's ex partner was unbearable in the '72 film and plays even worse here as for the action scenes they're pretty old hat which causes one to wonder why even remake the original from
<START> if you are studying welles and want to see just how far he fell after citizen kane this film will prove it the cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as i was all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welles and hayworth fans out there
<START> it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was 80 of let's face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career relaunch then i think it might never happen with this on their cv the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest br br i'm sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it's a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
<START> this has always been one of my favourite movies and will always be over the last few years i have become a 50's 60's sci fi freak trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were the great colours and the sets get me going too it's a pity when they re make some of these good old movies they nearly always stuff it up just look at the recent re do of the day the earth stood still it's utter garbage forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time and now they're trying to re make it too and i shudder to think what the new one will be like to my mind some things such as fantastic classic movies should just be left alone to be what they are classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories and giving people a thrill in the process once they add all the techno crap that we have available now the film just seems to be more dog meat from the hollywood sausage factory nothing special at all by the way i notice that the astronauts' uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for queen of outer space that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then doesn't it hey less money and better films hmmm br br great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen in a serious role and anne francis walter pidgeon who has always been one of my favourite actors earl holiman and of course robby the robot br br the special effects are fantastic and the storyline is not too far fetched this is a great sci fi experience
<START> i really disliked this movie mainly because of the main characters they are both immature selfish and self centered people they hurt everybody around them playing their silly game the visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting am i supposed to be happy when these two psycho people finally consummate their love for each other br br after watching this movie i was thinking this is supposed be the 1 smash from france br br spoiler br br as for the end good riddance they both deserve each other br br
<START> revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque dean jagger trying to convince general duval george cleveland that his mate tsiang william crowell is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies a bit like the people i work with really anyway tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia roy d'arcy but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire dorothy stone who is engaged to louque who also comes along during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson robert noland at which louque isn't too pleased about in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire clifford co written directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation after watching it i can see why the script by halperin howard higgin rollo lloyd all uncredited has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull as exciting as watching paint dry nothing much happens for ages then nothing much happens afterwards either how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie these zombies are just brainwashed people filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead 1968 at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago the black white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location the acting is wooden largely unimpressive revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations budget labels but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for
<START> i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed i generally like to see documentaries but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than 'earth' i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores running on the displayed high definition tvs after seeing the movie it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers it's just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not br br without hesitating a 10 out of 10 for sure there are more thrilling movies but in regard of documentaries 'earth' is definitely one of the best of it's genre
<START> where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk evil doctors perform their experiments madmen hold the ultimate karate championship and the uber rich hunt humans for sport i had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location you'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began br br the island in this movie used to belong to dr moreau but has recently been purchased by the re animator himself jeffrey combs old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer if that sounds familiar that's because this is roughly the same basic set up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea not to mention a host of other nu image movies so apparently jeffrey's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny he did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth turning his son into a shark man br br william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments if someone would have given him a sailor's hat william would have been a dead ringer for the skipper from gilligan's island in typical bond villain fashion the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son not chums like buddies chum like shark food so enter shark boy who starts stalking the skipper and his cohorts all over the island they of course make half hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark man suit br br the movie didn't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands it's funny that this movie is called hammerhead it made me think of an old joke why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop that's pretty much how this movie is the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it's over
<START> george raft as steve brodie the carefree dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare is pitted against the lumbering sentimental chuck connors wallace beery a soft touch for every panhandler connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays notably runaway orphan swipes jackie cooper complete with kittens and the homeless lucy calhoun an out of town innocent with ambitions to become a writer br br in this male dominated culture communication takes place mostly in the form of violence one sees why the bowery is a martin scorsese favorite exploding cigars provide a running gag swipes enjoys throwing rocks through windows in chinatown on one occasion setting a laundry alight the simultaneous arrival of both brodie's and beery's volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl during which the building burns to the ground beery casually saps a troublesome girl and thumps anyone who disagrees with him including brodie whom he defeats in a night time fist fight on a moored barge to regain control of his saloon lost on a bet that brodie wouldn't have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge brodie does make the leap but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment br br as usual walsh fills the frame with detail illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin singing waiters bullying barmen whores from suicide hall being hustled into the black maria tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don't want a minor but admirable little film
<START> cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that i've ever seen br br not that they didn't try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting i'm not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrong br br some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an insincerity about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it that was bolstered by the pretty 17 year old girl who was in love with the 30 year old junkie br br and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you've just not seen enough br br skip it i assumed that this was a first time director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before i'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money
<START> garde Ã  vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub plots it contains if you're not used to french wordy films based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action don't even try to watch it you'll only obtain boredom to death and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you br br garde Ã  vue is a wordy film essentially based upon dialogs written by audiard by the way and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances br br why does maÃ®tre martineau serrault prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8 years sexual relation his wife knows it she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in 1980 in france there was still death penalty rather than unveiling the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life
<START> to me this was colin farrells best movie evr he introduced himself to america through this movie and he was great he really got you into his charictor and made u feel the passion he was putting into his role in my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite
<START> a complete waste of time br br halla bol is a complete waste of time the script and dialogues are poorly written the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy this movie was clearly aiming for the rang de basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made rdb connect with its audience great script terrific acting good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown br br compared to that near masterpiece halla bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain's persian rug and the hero's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less all of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like divyashakti and phool aur kaante became big hits but movie making has become should have become more subtle and thoughtful of late br br rajkumar santoshi is a capable director and i appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it he resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the rakeysh mehras and aamir khans br br even if you don't agree with everything i say you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that rang de basanti was much much better and mr santoshi should have left the industry bashing to om shanti om industry bashing that's right santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back biting bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named sania there are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry don't believe everything you see br br all in all raise your voice against movies like this and don't spend your hard earned money on this bomb br br out of
<START> in the '70s charlton heston starred in sci fi flicks of varying quality soylent green is one of the better ones he plays robert thorn a detective in 2022 new york in this future most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called soylent green but when thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product he finds himself on the run br br i guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays but even so it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture also starring leigh taylor young chuck connors brock peters joseph cotten and edward g robinson in his final role
<START> land of plenty is not a film it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders br br many felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it he's actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes br br one might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but wenders' case is extreme it's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get sloppish results br br in a few words this film does not deserve your time
<START> national lampoon's class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters lots of laughs and some great music from chuck berry when walter bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl a horny fat guy the high school beauty the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun and who doesn't then this movie should be on your movies to see list
<START> i thought they should have called this movie whites instead of heights godawful the kind of film that makes people hate new yorkers people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important give me a break such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it and so they introduce get this a character even whiter than the rest of the cast i thought he was an albino at first who's supposed to be welsh i'm still trying to decipher that accent intellectually dishonest this movie is the kind of film that's able to fool so many people into thinking it's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious better to fill the theaters with mi5 10 than with this pretentious crap must have been a better play because you can't fall off the floor
<START> and gi joe go stuck in the water i die of laufther every time i see this movie and then a big brown shark came this is comedy at it's best this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else andrew dice clay jerry tucker rock they can't thouch the man the myth the legend eddie murphy br br yo eddie we want more br br more more more more more more
<START> as i reach the backside of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today this film drives that point home to the core if you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film from kiss posters to an angel concert this movie rocks br br watch for a young laura dern why they didn't have more songs from the runaways i'll never know br br i did have a problem with randy quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff br br foxes belongs right there with over the edge fast times dazed confused and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks br br i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all
