<START> producer joel schumacher who also directed phone booth '02 and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat colin farrell roland bozz intermission '03 gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back matthew davis jim paxton blue crush '02 gave a great supporting role and shea whigham pvt wilson all the real girls '03 showed his true acting skills in the role that he played there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body enjoyable and entertaining film to view
<START> i only saw iphigenia once almost 30 years ago but it has haunted me since br br one sequence particularly stays in mind and could only have been fashioned by a great director as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is br br the context the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon's shoulders an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas endangering his great expedition to troy he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships he initially resists but comes around and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors achilles br br clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive find out about the sacrifice and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance meanwhile the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent dishonorable way he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her br br the shot the camera circles the two young people without looking directly at each other they bemoan their fate and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war suddenly they gaze at each other and for one moment we feel both their power and beauty and the unstated except by the camera irony that in another time another place they perhaps could love each other and be married it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant br br what direction what camera what storytelling
<START> this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen the first being ghost rider there is absolutely no plot climax conflict or any other major detail required in portraying a story this 'film' is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his manly side and the 'tough guy he really is' i completely wasted my time watching this film the best part would have to be the ending credits if i were ebert or roper i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously on the same mental level as him in conclusion do not waste your time watching this movie it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret
<START> i couldn't believe my eyes when i watched nuremberg yesterday on dutch television it starts very slowly the backgrounds of the nuremberg trials become clear step by step the germans have a funny english accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage i have ever seen br br it is important that people get to see such footage although i absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material but in this film it was completely ridiculous it was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary tv series it was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy in stead of trying to move us with well done scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint's the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin and bones camp inmates it doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust br br i'm very angry
<START> cinematically this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but i br br don't care if there is a strong representation of what the 80's were br br like for a lot of us in the innercity anyways and what hip hop zulu br br nation and break dancing were really like great music great br br dancing it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past br br when hip hop was a way of life it's also interesting to see new br br york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some viewers br br may be too young to remember that it was a poor run down city br br during the 70's and 80's this is the best of all the hip hop break br br dancing movies that came out around that period of course the br br 80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and br br movies but those of us who lived through it will always remember br br it fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
<START> the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of ingrid's fiancÃ© it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiancÃ©'s boorish son and the military attachÃ©'s vying for the maid's attention looked stupid sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film
<START> i can't believe i watched this expecting more it starts out ok this movie pushes the limits of reality way to far at least the first one was somewhat realistic it rips off the first movie and even mentions the joshua project anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie it does have one good message in it though watch out for big brother the movie just makes it seem like big brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality that was very aggravating even the make up on the actors was completely bad some of the acting is pretty good some of the acting is really bad though the script was ok at some points and completely messed up at other parts this movie plays on convenience about every five minutes like i said i can't believe i watched it expecting more i think i am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth q
<START> cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars it has great action sequence's edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies
<START> babyface notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read nietzche she says books ain't never done her no good soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank the dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of stanwyck's willing victims part of the forbidden hollywood collection i watched the extended version the dvd has both versions plus red headed woman and waterloo bridge an interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir b
<START> i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark series back when the cable box was built like a keyboard and it intrigued me even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted the performances of depardieu dewaere are very enjoyable they have a good chemistry together miou miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking a movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times at least not in the us since it seems to sensationalize things like violence robbery casual sex this movie proves that with a talented cast also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject it saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide in the near future i ll will check him out with depardieu miou miou in get out your hankerchief
<START> i can't believe that in the 34 prior comments nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip off of born yesterday a man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after gangster is left in the lurch but born yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff technicolor transfer to dvd is deplorable natalie kalmus would be rolling over in her grave check out the paperboy recognize him but it's historically interesting to see the roots of rock 'n roll also interesting is ewell's introduction to cinemascope a new format at the time
<START> the thing that stands out in my mind in this film sadly is the introduction where john berlin andy garcia is driving into town you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees it's quite beautiful br br as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin well andy is just too hispanic latin for it to be passable maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story who knows but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks he stands out like a sore thumb especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry yeah i know big deal right he's still a good actor br br the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness don't ask appears helena robertson uma thurman thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt freddy ross i got worried henriksen's played in some pretty strange films especially of late i still can't forget him in the bloodbath movie pumpkinhead br br berlin movies into a small town from l a as a detective he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched so did the irony of spoiler freddy's murder with the recording and name similarities i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight jennifers and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn't pack much of a punch in retrospect this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons br br john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out as to the ending it is a bit of a surprise but is highly arguable much like sgt ross' murder the killer chooses to walk after his running victim opting instead to frolick i guess br br and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it's ridiculous i won't ruin the very end because despite it's shakiness it's a good surprise afterward though you'll probably say as i did boy was she lucky 4 10
<START> this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great br br it isn't an idealistic movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character gigi would say
<START> it is said that david lynch's films and shorts won't appeal to everyone neither will dumbland maybe more than ever i have a feeling that dumbland as people come across it will be a true mark of 'i get it' or 'what the hell' it's not surrealism exactly but absurd to the point of no return it's also very very very stupid but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is and this self consciousness is a plus not a detraction br br it's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts the kind that might not even make it on hertzfeldt and judge's animation show which i might add lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work centered on a lummox with an iq of 20 who has a constantly quivering with fear wife and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and or an alien the episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill a salesman who can recite the gettysburg address watching over a sick brother in law ant hallucinations and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around all the while lynch is still experimenting as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off inland empire br br for one thing he's going back to the roots of his very first short six figures getting sick six times in the usage of repetition as a means to an end this sometimes works excruciatingly well and sometimes not sometimes like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect and even an episode like with the guy's friend coming over is funny more so for the beavis butt head comparison both laugh like idiots and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious abstractions in the crudest ways imaginable and excessive violence br br in what comes closest to surrealism in ants the guy mistakenly sprays bug spray just called kill one of lynch's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions on himself and envisions ants in a musical chorus line solos included and one of the most harrowingly funny things i've ever seen from the filmmaker is get the stick where we just see the guy cheered on by his son getting a stick lodged in his mouth soon the neck breaks eyes pop out and once said stick is removed he doesn't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices and it's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul mouthed language mostly from the man as well as from the 'grandmother' who in one of lynch's voices for the characters is the deepest of all and a shaky quality that's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from early hertzfeldt br br all the same i'm still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someone's hands if they haven't seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him there are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in lynch's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life however in general there's not a whole lot that should be read into it which is why i'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion those who dig the bottom less pits of animated comedy be prepared have a blast
<START> i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth i was not pleased with this film i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it first i was very disappointed with john hurt's performance here he looks as if his eyebrows were re shaped for this his performance was not convincing he was not as good as one would expect tim roth is cool as always here the gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think i guess the best part of the film was the end it had some cool action the only problem with the original was that it was too long this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times i remember some time ago when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why now i know i was hoping to to get blown away but i was not
<START> i hate over long over talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid 70's and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you haven't seen it don't miss your chance
<START> i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn't even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i'm shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s it and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense it's the worst kind of lame movie it's joyless
<START> br br i saw once no man's land 1987 imdb link http us imdb com title 0093638 and found it ok the film is about a guy who steals only porsches gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it in fact it has a lot of scenes that are worthless and the ending is very very bad br br the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used
<START> in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like silverado prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking
<START> as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable br br but don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the br br 70s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth
