<START> spoliers do not read any further if you haven't seen this movie br br picking up after the depressing phantasm ii ended the tall man kidnaps mike while reggie and new kid tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back and not end up as slaves on the tall man's red planet this one gets really silly the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse were only there for comic relief and the black karate chick can't remember her name was so irritating i couldn't wait to see if the tall man killed her character this one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be tim's character who comes in late and ultimately is the hero but it doesn't quite work out that way by the very end of this story liz is beheaded by the killer midgets mike gets a silver sphere implanted into his skull the spheres get reggie and the dwarfs get tim and there's no one left to stop the tall man the bad guy wins now how's that for a surprise twist at the end br br this was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95 and the ending of this one was at the time final and although it's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series but the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes and an even worse and more nonsensical ending br br 1 2 out of
<START> nothing in this film interested me i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing that's not laid back stanislofsky method that's just walking through and saying lines i'm afraid kidman's performance is sad the story is however mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting
<START> i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children's television show power rangers is all about br br i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever br br the costumes look completely atrocious like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym br br what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems what is up with the awful hair cuts and clothing on this show anyway not to mention this show is still playing on cable television just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem br br there's far better entertainment for today's children hopefully they aren't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show br br oh and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway
<START> the movie starts with a pair of campers a man and a woman presumably together hiking alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and slashes her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer br br we next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date sparking the token blonde's ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lost br br in the next scene we realize that this isn't just another the burning clone but a ghost story the women scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they've seen her children before disappearing of course br br the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace daddy's going hunting the little girl exclaims with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isn't a ghost like his children br br freaked out by something in the woods the token blonde splits running blindly into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains he's starving and it will be quick this doesn't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier maybe he's allergic are panthers honestly even in california she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where papa resides clearly someone lives here because there's a fire and something weird is roasting over it the children appear and warn them of papa who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrives br br for whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but daydreams about it we aren't given the reason for the children's demise the men go to sleep and are left unharmed the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friends br br the following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is going br br overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and that's being generous for all its misgivings the musical score is well done it's still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the toad 6 miles away i can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on br br alan skip bannacheck
<START> i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
<START> this movie is a must see movie for all congress should see this truthful documentary from the point of view of the soldier as should everyone in america the previous reviewer totally missed the point the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists but who just live in our enemy's territory and what it does to the soldiers we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately before another person is killed or injured this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans those who are injured mentally with ptsd post traumatic stress disorder or physically with lost limbs julie a roberts streamwood il
<START> while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities both were made just a few years apart both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies however the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me overall just seemed like a cheaper film with poor writing little energy and some very broad performances even when compared to operation petticoat i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio plus there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant an actor generally loved for his grace and class it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main
<START> this movie really has no beginning or end and it's really very unbelievable mary k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason they're put up in a 5 star hotel conveniently located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model looking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn't end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
<START> a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot
<START> elvira cassandra peterson is the host of a cheap horror show after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to england to pick it up hoping it will be some money but to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a cookbook elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her and with elvira's outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because elvira is on fire i really enjoyed this movie it's really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures she's just great the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it i would give elvira mistress of the dark 8 10
<START> masayuki suo who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic in japan anyway college sumo comedy shiko funjatta suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success br br the story is engaging we both laugh often naoto takenaka is hilarious as he is in suo's two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society real life in japan suo has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into today's japan br br also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters takenaka to short cameos many
<START> b movie yes diy yes first movie yes but aestheically a this movie definitely had some bad sound editing lighting acting etc etc problems however this movie has many positive things about it first off the most annoying character dies first second its made to be a parody funny b rated horror movie the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing br br the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie for what it is just that it is really good
<START> what was the deal with the clothes they were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s the cars were even were outdated the school was outdated the nuns attire was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the 40's with its wards and wooden staircases and things nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 my mother was laughing saying geeeee od when was this movie made when we pressed the info button on our remote we were sure 1991 had to be typo did anybody else notice this my favorite part though was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband on the telephone about the inverted cross in the mirror and he just says well look i've got a congress meeting i'll talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man my mothers favorite part was when they gave the spawn of the devil child her very own rottweiler my mother said just what the spawn of the devil needs a rottweiler she also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches clutching their chests her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving 5 miles a hour driving right into the garbage truck dump truck front end loader thingee he had about 20 seconds to just stop the car but he just kept going with a real dumb vacant look on his face i mean how fast can you go in a school parking lot whatever
<START> my take a goofy yet imaginative mess br br keanu reeves yes that keanu reeves and alex winter return as the two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the time trotting adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure now a cult classic in this sequel bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time they might as well travel heaven and hell too during the beginning of this sequel bill and ted are preparing for a battle of the bands competition which may make them more famous than ever meanwhile many years in a futuristic civilization the time wizard from the first film the always watchable george carlin is running a university praising bill and ted's names there an evil tyrant joss ackland from the hunt for red october plots to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all so he sends two identical android replicas in the words of bill and ted robot us's to do the dirty job br br there after bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends and their show along this whacked out voyage they play board games with none other than death william sadler from die hard 2 reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more br br bogus journey's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren't up to to date standards and even some of the humor and the for the time look and feel are somewhat dated to be honest the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year even for the 90's but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction bill and ted's bogus journey is fun imaginative and yes bogus br br rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> the film is a bit tedious it's mostly a silent film with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice overs while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious you don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture and by then it's too late the first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn and unimaginative soft porn at that later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense but it's too late because by then the audience is lost there is some nice location shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there the campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel my biggest problem with the film is that the director writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story
<START> aside from the great movie metropolis this is about the oldest pure sci fi movie while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons first it is extremely original in both style and content even in the 21st century there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredible using matte paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow sure you could sit back and knock the film because by today's standards the effects are only so so but you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 world's fair br br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness the end result seems to be a little of both how true br br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality stank particularly the sound if this is available on a dvd hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning as the sound on the video kept cutting out i really would have appreciated this
<START> a documentarist like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story will pascoe fails utterly in this effort cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky's wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton the footage is shot amateurishly and in video pascoe's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen 9 11 activism truth br br lame br br compare this with documentaries like the corporation or the fog of war which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently br br the only saving graces of the film are chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes br br one of the more interesting passages was chomsky's recounting of his experience with national public radio he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views while npr's liberal dogma strait jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages yet another media outlet to be skeptical of br br this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only
<START> i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
<START> with all the adult innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids yes this movie might have a few swear words there's that time where knox swears but they don't let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and that's including movies from back in the day not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family br br the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it i'm not going to mention them because i don't want any spoilers here br br all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some cookies and watch this movie
<START> i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent br br till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future
