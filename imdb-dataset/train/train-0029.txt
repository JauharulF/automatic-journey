<START> i cant believe some people actually like this yet still call themselves batman fans even going as far as to say it's better than btas which it's not it should be plagiarism for them to use batman's name for this piece of crap it's not batman br br the whole premise of the show is ''if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you'' batman isn't all about weapons he uses his batarang and grappling hook and batmobile thats it he doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone i don't know where the hell they got the idea for a batbot or whatever they have ruined all the villains mr freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft tall top hat the ventriloquist is now called scarface making the dummy the whole centerpiece for the character they even got a dumb idea to make him a giant wtf and the two worst character changes are that of the joker and riddler they have changed riddler to a gothic retro teenage freak and the joker to an acrobat with dreads he looks like a bob marley wannabe they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than b r did i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat
<START> i saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it then again that was when claire danes was a good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywood ized bitch she is today anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films how far would you really go for your best friend i was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when i watch it now i own it i remember as soon as i left the theater i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her
<START> diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest i say that because we were entranced by the brief five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms br br ostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment having only been in paris several times i was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the city's locations in any event the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in consequence br br the film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell sell sell br br go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed
<START> i've watched this movie twice now on dvd and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesn't fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominator br br what really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over dramatize nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you don't have high expectations but terribly commercially spirited i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence this movie is cool observant and generally light handed in its judgement which is good br br the story has its flaws especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy still she doesn't come off as weak in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters she's always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging and i take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didn't traumatise people like it does now people didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and i like that attitude br br my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare don't watch if if you want non stop action or heart renting emotion
<START> one thing about hollywood someone has a success and it's always rushed to be copied and another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio br br rock hudson got such accolades for his performance in the texas based film giant that universal executives must have thought let's quick get him into another modern texas setting br br similarly robert stack got great reviews for the high and the mighty as the pilot who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up role br br both of these ends were achieved in written on the wind before hudson was the big ranch owner now he's the son of a hunting companion of robert stack's father who took hudson under his wing in other words the james dean part without the james dean racism from giant br br lauren bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that stack's hadley oil company uses hudson likes her but she's dazzled by stack's millions and when he woos a girl he's got the means to really pursue a campaign she marries stack br br and last but not least in the mix we have dorothy malone who's stack's amoral sister who has a yen for rock but rock ain't about to get tangled up with this wild child br br dorothy malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine roles before landing this gem she got a best supporting actress award for her part as marilee hadley and it was well deserved br br if you like splashy technicolor fifties soap opera than this is the film for you
<START> i'm somewhat of a fan of lynche's work so i was excited when i found this dvd unfortunately i was very let down it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor the animation is very crude no doubt done using macromedia each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows br br for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it however if you've spent much time on newgrounds com like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd if lynch submitted this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists but since i saw this on dvd instead of on newgrounds i give it a 4 10 instead of a 7 10 as i would have otherwise these cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expected better quality both in story and in animation
<START> at first glance it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura both have noirish qualities both were directed by otto preminger and both star dana andrews and gene tierney but that's where most of the comparisons end laura dealt with posh sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed up in a murder where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different strata these are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon small time hoods are a dime a dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks getting caught up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing br br while i haven't seen his entire body of work based on what i have seen dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat down cop det sgt mark dixon he's the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession one night he goes too far and accidentally kills a man he does his best to cover it up but things get complicated when he falls for the dead man's wife morgan taylor tierney whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case as morgan's father means the world to her dixon's got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself br br technically where the sidewalk ends is outstanding besides the terrific performance from andrews the movie features the always delightful tierney she has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all top notch overall it's an amazingly well made film br br if i have one complaint and admittedly it's a very very minor quibble it's that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings it's a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed up with some of these unsavory characters it's not really her fault it's just the way tierney comes across she seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part but her gentle kind trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal
<START> high energy raoul walsh classic from 1933 the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy george raft with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry it's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids plenty of wisecracks at the beginning but the characters soften up as the film progresses apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery's saloon the various characters sexy chorus line lots of drinking a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so called pre code restrictions and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone i don't like to compare eras but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see
<START> real cool smart movie i loved sheedy's colors especially the purple car alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella i liked sheedy's reference to how her face had gotten fatter the roadside dance scene is brilliant really liked this one
<START> i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was non stop entertaining and suspenseful it had a mind twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on valentine's day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills oh and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating please don't
<START> quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids john thaw is brilliant as always without any hint of inspector morse about him the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn't find him convincing in every scene i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate as far as i could tell br br it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because as it turns out she lost her daughter getting a boy instead she completely ignores him the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr tom it has the same feel to it
<START> this is the official sequel to the '92 sci fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers unisols in this one it's i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols codenamed unisol 2500 for some reason as usual something goes wrong the on site super computer named seth like the snake in king cobra the same year goes power crazy takes command of the unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new super unisol body jai white we're lookin' at the next step in evolution folks most of van damme's fights are with one particularly mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on comin' drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him forgetaboutit much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out classed he's even going grey around the edges but though he takes a lickin' he keeps on kickin' most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if you're a pro wrestling fan
<START> night of the living homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11 obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably dawn of the dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains br br kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a 20 to a homeless man in front of his house more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park until the town is completely overrun with them this is a very strong randy marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center but before randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming i don't have any change unfortunately the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change br br the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem unfortunately homeless people break into the man's house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself however he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in fantastic easter special two weeks ago br br meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the man's head when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out randy pulls the trigger br br in evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica california br br the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re watchable 8 10
<START> like his elder brothers claude sautet and jean pierre melville alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers la menace 1977 and sÃ©rie noire 1979 among others police python 357 is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career they had a splendid cinematography painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake br br the police superintendent ferrot yves montand is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia lÃ©opardi stefania sandrelli and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover his superior ganay franÃ§ois pÃ©rier when the latter learns it he kills her in a fit of anger ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him br br one could deem that this kind of far fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes one can see right through it but corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling dusky atmosphere the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however it is crucial for what will follow this key moment corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation in spite of drawbacks corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story mÃ©nard mathieu carriÃ¨re who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation but his superior knows that he usually works alone actually ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself eventually the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself he's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them br br the backdrop of this thriller orlÃ©ans is efficiently enhanced by corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm
<START> i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time it was just really touching although not a new concept this was a very well made film
<START> i consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama i can be very stuck up about films too br br not all art films however are better than king kong i quite possibly would give kong two stars double this film's haul br br my guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play for the less discerning art buff a film that looks like a play is 'great art' br br this film however was useless br br there was hardly any story so it relied on high drama the only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not so deep and meaningful dialogue then no great acting hardly br br to be excessively fair some of the scenery was interesting though communist flats city vistas petersburg and the soviet trams still in service
<START> freddy has gone from scary to funny in this 6th installment in the nightmare series br br it's been 2 years well actually 11 since this film takes place in 2001 and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one john doe jacobb from part 5 even doe the film gives on hint who he is in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street not only does freddy gets his wishes but he also gets his daughter back to elm street when she finds out what is happening she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all we also get to see some of freddy's eerie backgrounds br br rachel talalay who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now many people hate this film but i liked it it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his wisecrackes comdey and makes the series more funny than scary so this film is really a comdey sore to speak it is not the wrost in the series part 2 still holds it br br
<START> i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way br br mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece br br stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental
<START> envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear obviosly ben wants no part of it but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun give it a watch
<START> firstly i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below 6 10 is clearly utter nonsense br br creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing br br there is much mystique in this film many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels how was 'craig' created and what happened to him br br a fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later the bunker dog soldiers and deathwatch br br look forward to more of these fantastic films
