<START> i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film yes there are vampire stereotypes yes there are scientific stereotypes covered here even martial arts stereotypes all well and good and sure not all perfectly done however i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked the cultural significance of its location the film is set in pensacola florida and does not try to avoid saying so that's a bold move in the film world today and a rare treat for fans of indy films and indeed it may not be the last pensacola is world renowned as a navy town an aviation town a lumber town and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy rarely is it seen as a growing film town but that's all changing now more film companies are coming in to shoot and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola based indy films and more are on the way pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community and by and by the world is taking more notice watch and listen world the pensacolians are coming like a virus
<START> the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps accidents and destruction mostly caused by stan but with ollie receiving the bulk of the punishment see the great 'the music box' 1933 or 'towed in a hole' 1932 as some some classic examples br br here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by stan's father the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations it doesn't come off it's merely another third rate tedious 30s comedy heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures ollie's finger wiggling stan's blank stares etc or comic abilities br br the film begins with them running from the police since we never see or know why it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in colonel buckshot's mansion the premise for the 'humor' ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging they are not playing 'stan and ollie' in this film their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor br br stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here he's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot but none of it rises much above the silly we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtree's name the call me a cab okay you're a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns and a non sequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two and james finlayson is still doing his silent era full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacks br br stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'sons of the desert' 1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them be themselves in fact 1932 34 seem to be their best years br br since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it i have to give it a 3
<START> the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane's family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that's the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn's family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn't do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i'll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i've already went on about lane's family br br now that i'm over the acting i'll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it's not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn't just secede they'd send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we're not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short
<START> at least for a half hour a week i haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks abc cbs nbc in years all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter most of the other characters are interesting as well the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times too the animation is top notch and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show usually when they hire big names to star in a show they're trying to hide a poor script or characters not entirely true in this show though there's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their own br br this is definitely for 16 and up there's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads it's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode br br father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs pinky and the brain and freakazoid it's the same type of humor grown up it may not be as witty as spielberg's classic tv series but it's still good br br i hope that it finishes this season off well and is renewed for future seasons otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again
<START> i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie bravo the spaz bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of film making especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know don't have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlie's angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man it's such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush again thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
<START> a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys o lan his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience o lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions
<START> i watched this last night with low expectations the reasons being i don't usually like made for tv movies and rarely have i liked cast reunion movies but the critic in the los angeles times seemed to like this so i gave it a chance i'm glad i did it was pretty good adam west and burt ward reunite as themselves but in a way they were acting as their batman and robin selves they were being campy and not taking themselves or this movie too seriously the movie starts out with them searching for the george barris designed batmobile that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan's home while they are searching for the car they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together this is told in flashback it was well done the actors that they got for the younger burt ward and adam west were dead on and for a tv movie it got down to the nitty gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen i give this one a 9 10 i liked it that much
<START> any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re write of the grimms' fairytale they'll be singing 'bibbity bobbity boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days it is a classic for all children especially those adults who are young at heart
<START> john carradine john ireland and faith domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this grade g horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion br br for carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in with that magnificent sonorous voice of his carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in br br he plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion who movie director john ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film it's even got a graveyard but with a missing occupant faith domergue is ireland's aging star and carole wells is the young ingenue br br in the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already the script is so incoherent i'm still trying to figure out the point i won't waste any more gray matter on it
<START> i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didn't need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace life's possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much hyped 'somersault ' i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but 'peaches' delivers the goods i'm glad i saw it
<START> you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story believing it all then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling and then put back together again brilliant br br one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary i don't know if other than andrew jarecki's capturing the friedmans there has ever been anything like anna broinowski's forbidden lie it features exposes defends reveals and questions everything about norma khouri author of honor lost the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordan br br what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this exposure of khouri is made with khouri's full participation br br for the initial portion of the film khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman the story of the book she sounds completely believable convincing br br then her story is taken apart exposed by eminently believable and convincing people such as women's rights activists in jordan investigative reporters there and in australia where khouri lived for a while br br khouri comes back and denies the accusations taking a successful lie detector test in the process there comes another segment of devastating exposures not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations not all but the essential ones in the matter of the book br br and the houdini act continues with round after round in this heavy weight seesaw prize fight surprise after surprise and there is no happy ending in the sense of resolution brilliant
<START> you can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and i had expected it to be campy anyway it's not all that campy in reality with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter who don't take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight riley smith is exceptionally bad the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra low budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and physicality in the script to get their point across although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft core homoeroticisms which aren't all that edgy i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason the film is grainy with a tv quality look and acting level there are a few sexy scenes that are alright the boys writhing in bed in their boxers feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them and some of them are kinda funny and i liked the digs at l ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones but it still isn't any good 3 10
<START> i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king's book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but he's not in an arena he's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's i guess you'd call them villians who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute garbage there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor but he messed up with this one
<START> this has to be one of the most beautiful moving thought provoking films around it's good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved every time i see the ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i can't help but cry my eyes out john thaw's performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us gone but not forgotten a outstanding film full marks
<START> so often a band will get together for a re union concert only to find that they just can't get it together not so here this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd weren't even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream 3 men 3 instruments no fuss clapton by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some sort of drumming guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this one's a 10 for me
<START> infamous pre code film really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers when he dies in an accident she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder one bed at a time although obviously there's no actual sex shown the film is quite sleazy unfortunately after the initial shock value fades around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through as always she's fantastic
<START> this was different that's for sure just look at the cast talk about oddballs br br william h macy and ben stiller were the stars although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superhero wannabees the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of pee wee herman fame br br there is lots of humor garish colors and no lulls it's a pretty entertaining lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters all of whom want to be heroes a la superman batman spiderman you name they have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes don't and don't want to it's silly but you know that going on br br it's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity it's a long movie for one so hectic so taking a break here and there is okay the language was tame so kids could enjoy this too in fact i don't recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering what a dumb f ing movie i thought it was fun two hours but i'd rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks
<START> i went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn't even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids ages 10 and 13 and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn't save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie i use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing
<START> peter ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins as soon as he walks out the gates he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing though this time he has his sights set pretty high this is actually one of the weak points about the film as he apparently knows nothing about computers few did back in 1968 but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight yeah right anyway he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large american corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary it's amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses but it's a movie after all so i was able to suspend disbelief by the end of the film he and his new wife maggie smith are able to run away with a million pounds br br at the very end though it gets very very confusing and smith announces she's managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that ustinov started though she didn't realize they were all dummy companies this should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless what they seem to imply and i could be guessing wrong here is that ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless either way the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy and this just didn't make much sense it's a shame really as the acting and most of the writing was great karl malden bob newhart peter ustinov and maggie smith were just wonderful br br if i seem to have interpreted the end let me know as the film seemed very vague in details at the end
<START> this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film he was both funny and sad carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan nolan blames god morgan freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life then god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers as i said before carrey did an excellent job i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor actress the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point this movie can be funny bruce's dog as well as sad the break up the script worked well too i am glad they made a sequel to this film i rate this film a 9 10
