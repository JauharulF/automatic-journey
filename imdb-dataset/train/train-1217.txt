<START> let me start off by saying that i didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and mtv was pasted on the front cover so i was not expecting much what i was expecting was a tear jerker overly dramatic but at least effective br br i was wrong br br firstly let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie br br the acting was my main gripe with the film by god is it awful the main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast she's maryl streep the main hero heath is just plain awful he can sing decent sounding clichÃ©d songs but that's about it his acting broke the 'sad' moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter the isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldn't display emotion whatsoever and when he tried to it failed miserably neil patrick harris was the only decent actor playing edward although it's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what i've seen him do oh and the father wasn't half bad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember br br the story itself was not very good more breakups than you can imagine predictable story until the ending which i barely understood extremely one sided characters with no real depth to them overall just not interesting or compelling nothing we've never seen before done much better and nothing worth watching here br br the ending is suppose to be a tearjerker it did nothing of the sort the ending isn't built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought in fact i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of wait when did they say that what never a good sign the editing was probably the worst i've seen though i do understand the fade ins fade outs are done because this was originally made for tv but that's really no excuse br br overall the movie is just garbage i'm a sensitive guy i cried during two episodes of the simpsons i never cried during this crap not even close really this movie is not worth your time if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere
<START> the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along or just a spoof the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic not realistic at all a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic but the shooting scenes were a joke a previous commentator thought this movie was great and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush this was not a democratic or republican western it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially i wonder if it made any money at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students if that was the case then it was a great movie
<START> jodie foster cherie currie the former lead singer of the seminal all girl rock group the runaways in her remarkably able acting debut marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular quartet who are a tight knit clique of troubled fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent uncaring self absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley california suburbs the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well being of both herself and the others she's especially concerned about the good hearted but reckless and self destructive currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end br br this picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent adrian fatal attraction jacob's ladder lyne's direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nerve wrackingly chaotic capricious and unpredictable everyday life leon bijou's soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of donna summer's elegiac on the radio the top notch cast includes sally kellerman as foster's neurotic insecure peevish mother scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude randy quaid as kagan's rich older boyfriend british 60's pop singer adam faith as foster's feckless absentee rock promoter father and lois smith as kagan's smothering overprotective mother appearing in brief bits are robert romanus mike damone fast times at richmont high as one of foster's morose ex boyfriends and a gawky braces wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving currie's grim ultimate fate is very heart breaking foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and under appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence
<START> if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting lsd or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once br br do not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod
<START> this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally well thanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances dana andrews stars as a hot headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains soon after the film begins andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he'll be off the force a bit later while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself this time he does not use excessive force but the assailant is killed andrews panics and assumes they won't believe him so he tries to cover up the death though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime br br there's a lot more to the film than this including a plot involving a slimy villain gary merrill and a love interest for andrews gene tierney all in all this is one of the better examples of the genre with great gritty dialog superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story this is the way noir was meant to be
<START> absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch i highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywhere br br a 10
<START> no need to detail what others have written in other reviews here goes the summary br br much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous the colors are superb would love to have it done in silk as a necktie br br the story and execution is a total snooze it was quite difficult to stay awake at times br br if you are a student of the fine arts medieval calligraphy early religion and so forth have at it this is a film for you br br if you want an engaging entertaining movie look elsewhere this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement br br vikings didn't have horns by the way
<START> dreadful acting a thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle br br women are subjugated and revolve around men tom selleck shows his acting range from a to b
<START> warning there might be spoilers ahead if you care br br okay the basic premise of this homegrown texas film is college kids spookhouse evil magic book scary stuff in practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on a bunch of frat boys along with assorted girlfriends volunteers is setting up a charity haunted house the project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character whose main purpose seems to be verbally physically assaulting as many cast members as possible i had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy regardless the kids are visited by local character annual pumpkin carving champion pumpkin jack an elderly coot who is described as the santa claus of halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe flashed prologue where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir fry needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive there's some good stuff in this film but not much everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent on the other hand the performers either underact or overact drastically much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series there is hardly any musical score to speak of just snatches of songs throughout the film and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere that last problem is the most telling two thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters tom is a nice guy dating heidi the control freak but he used to date jill who is now dating dan the jerk but she's started a relationship kira the girl who wears too many shawls capes dan is a really big jerk gary likes to play jokes and steve lily like to have a lot of sex stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scene calm down it's pretty tame left me looking for the fast forward button that leaves us with half an hour of lo calorie scares a klunky ending and a deep seated dislike of ol' pumpkin jack who i blame for the whole mess unless you can get this on some sort of deep discount rental and really have seen everything else in the store put it back on the shelf and keep looking
<START> i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once moribund visayan film understorey panaghoy is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular that claims more speakers than tagalog the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red kit car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster without those small yet glaring details panaghoy would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating daghang salamat manoy cesar addendum this film sure beats peque gallaga's oro plata mata which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war alos there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's the color purple and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of noli me tangere
<START> sergio martino's the case of the scorpion's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife the money is subsequently snatched by a black clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow br br scorpion's tail plays the mystery element written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi fairly straight but being a giallo the murders themselves are memorable and well staged in fact the violence in this movie is very strong in places a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone's avant garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales in this case london and athens where martino manages to get in respectively the houses of parliament and the acropolis there is also some inventive camera work too the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento's crystal plumage however it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria so martino's film is influential in its own right br br this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non genre fans can appreciate the performances are good and the production values are fine although the plane explosion is shall we say somewhat low budget the dvd release by noshame is nice it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus however it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras this is a minor point though the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection
<START> unfortunately in cases such as these there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened this movie is a victim of such circumstances the writers too many of them have decided to take all of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best as in the real life case there is no clear answer no conclusion and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled like coffee without the caffeine or sex without the climax whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there at least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to and this does br br that is not to say there are not some great performances here kilmer as holmes does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an unsavory character kilmer and the real life lovers and friends who consulted on the film let the audience see a selfish troubled human being who though his faults were many and large was loved and cared for by many people except himself kudrow as holmes's wife only gives a glimmer of the dramatic actress she can be but it is very noticeable and unforgettable glimmer bosworth's character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give credence to what ultimately happened between dawn and holmes she turned him in 6 months after they fled to florida bosworth's apple cheeked performance is at time annoying at times touching but shows none of the backbone the real schiller must have possessed the other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him even dylan mcdermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker br br the fault of this movie does not lie with this cast but with the writing too many cooks spoil the soup and this kettle filled with so much promise ultimately leaves you hungry the story and characters may have been less than sympathetic but in what movie of this ilk are they not so other movies such as 1989's drugstore cowboy starring matt dillon who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused worked with similar subject matter and mastered it to such a degree that you felt a kinship with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done van sandt could have given james cox and his crew a few lessons had someone bothered to try and find the truth this would have been an intriguing story as it is you will find the accompanying wadd documentary more palatable in the 2 disc dvd and much more informative you will realize from the dvd that holmes was not a bad guy but not a very good one either as are most people
<START> i have not read the novel or anything other by kurt vonnegut but i am now intending to start this grips you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling taking you places you don't expect the plot is interesting throughout the pacing is spot on nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen it is well told and well thought out i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to it is intense and exciting as well as funny and sad the acting is excellent nolte absolutely shines goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs and lee and arkin are spellbinding i could go on really no role is treated to a less than stellar performance the editing and cinematography are marvelous and all of the visuals are great with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon as well as the other two apparently related to this through the author of the books there is one scene of sexuality and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it it is not pleasant 8 10
<START> a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life one as a happily married man with a ten year oldish child the other as a sex fiend the bulk of the documentary like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist listening to his story and intelligently probing him nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes if she had i would have rated this movie a big fat f as it is it rates an f implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage diary of a sex addict falls into the category of films that once one has seen it one wishes that one hadn't
<START> what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe that doesn't rule it out however get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter great wasted night stuff al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself often with respectable jobs estate agent but how clarke can convince us that any of the two bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality grange hill or soon to go on to poor quality drama eastenders can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable are we really to believe that the icf on whom of course the drama is based would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokes br br the icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds andy nicholls' scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs oldman is so camp it is unbelievable most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick go for it
<START> i've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isn't the worst of the bunch it's certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls it's the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest from tiny lister doing his best john coffey the green mile impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fiancÃ© is pretty hot she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras br br in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi dr james bishop shakes his head while talking you'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie
<START> you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles br br its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense br br its a turkey of the untastey kind avoid it
<START> review may contain some spoilers i'll make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well it's pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison's police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called f r a t first response assault tactics he's teamed with an on the edge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i don't want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the f r a t team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice br br you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey's performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfying br br don't waste your time with this film i'm putting it on ebay this weekend
<START> i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend Â£3 renting it bobbins br br and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces br br p s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
<START> just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting for the most part it is a very interesting if not somewhat self involved show or at least the pilot is br br if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the new bsg you'll be sorely disappointed if you liked the drama you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with br br the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god s ' and the creation or re creation of 'human' life it will be interesting to see how this plays out br br i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising a small part of me wishes or hopes there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there aside from the back story i mentioned but that would probably convolute the storyline too much like bsg i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me but it's way too early to tell br br it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but i'm willing to give it a chance overall i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the proverbial towel'
