<START> i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud the only mystery here is how oscarÂ® winner f murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script
<START> luckily not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending br br but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots but also very chilling and even daring moments considering the production year 1969 the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done and it's not just because of the two george's actresses br br the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly no wonder and it certainly did hit me very effective also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad well being a case of war mostly bad br br for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must his work is always excellent touching but never over the top and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall talk about frÃ¤ulein let's hope they get this on dvd soon so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem
<START> the journey of hope 1990 is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland these people are so desperate to live like westerners that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation one family braves the cold the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel this problem exists world wide not just in america some people tend to forget that a heart breaker of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the end br br highly recommended
<START> i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago and i was very happy with the movie when i left it it's very intense and the closest i've come to crying in a movie in quite some time that is a credit to adam sandler who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it were it not coming out so early in the year don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam's disturbed br br there is some humor but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him adam plays two levels very well when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable but when he is well less stable he's powerful and dark br br i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss
<START> i've seen far too many flicks from this company this one is about middle of the pack one the good side its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story for what its worth many of their titles like sexy sixth sense are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility on the other side i found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks like vampire vixens gladiator eroticus spiderbabe or mistress frankenstein br br misty mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter as is darian caine i found barbara joyce hot in a school marm kinda way and ruby larocca a sexy little hottie br br watch this with the remote firmly in your free hand on a night when you need a break from porn don't waste your time wanting to check the story you've got better things to do w your life it is not a movie it's pure t a but not bad by that standard
<START> this movie is a rather odd mix of musical romance drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it it's basically one messy heap of different genres of which none really works out like it was supposed to br br this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor he's a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie i mean mickey rooney as a tough player he's an extremely small boyish looking man he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right he simply isn't convincing in his role br br because the movie mixes so many different genres the story also really feels as a messy one somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch lÃ¡szlÃ³ kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957 he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality br br let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white generally speaking black white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception br br it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies often simply as himself i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song br br an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney br br 4 10
<START> this early pia zadora vehicle followed a familiar harold robbins formula ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world in this case the movie industry but despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable zadora to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable never convinces as a screenwriter one would expect a movie about movie making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process but the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters observance skill with words a love hate relationship with one's own creative abilities her character is as empty as a donut hole and this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here the cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening and the scenes never really hang together so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad hollywood parties avoid
<START> college girl joanne murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments which includes selling the unneeded furniture this takes place during a break so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly empty premises on campus dorm that dripped blood is a low budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining the acting is pretty bad the plot is predictable but the gore effects are quite good the film was made by ucla film students stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow for next to nothing soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in very similar to the enveloping forests of jeff leiberman's fantastic just before dawn 7 out of 10 it's great to see daphne zuniga of the initiation fame run over few times by a car
<START> apart from having the longest reign in british history 63 years queen victoria also holds two other distinctions she was apart from our current queen the oldest ever british monarch living to the age of 81 and she was also the youngest ever british as opposed to english or scottish monarch coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in mrs brown the young victoria tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal sarah duchess of york whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra br br there are three main strands to the plot the first concerns the intrigues of victoria's mother the duchess of kent a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy who was widely rumoured to be her lover according to one unfounded rumour he and not the late duke of kent was victoria's natural father the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert and the attempts of king leopold of belgium who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe coburg to which both he and albert belonged the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history the bedchamber crisis of 1839 when supporters of the tory party which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi republican system of government with the monarch reduced to a figurehead br br scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the tories the predecessors of the modern conservative party their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified whereas melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform there may be some truth is these characterisations but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs and that they had benefited from william iv's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration br br lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies prince albert for example was not injured in edward oxford's attempt on victoria's life and melbourne in his late fifties at the time of victoria's accession was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent who was his sister in law but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet as he is shown doing here i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a regency order the duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830 which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act br br there are also occasional infelicities in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a danger major clichÃ© ahead warning yet in spite of scenes like this i came to enjoy the film there were some good performances especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy it is visually very attractive being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top although not as disastrously over the top as he was in moulin rouge br br the main reason for the film's success however is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the black clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused but a determined strong minded and loving young woman her love for albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people with the exception of george iii victoria's hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues blunt and friend make the young victoria a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history 8 10
<START> i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic but still alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post wwii england br br this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case it's a fabric that doesn't wear out wrinkle or even get dirty of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thick br br guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast those brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might chug along exactly like guiness's goofy invention but it's a good ride all the same
<START> i originally came across linda feferman's seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure the movie stars jennifer connelly almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind as natalie becker byron thames plays her best friend in the world jeff moran the film is definitely a milder cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink's and some kind of wonderful's of the 1980's which is exactly why it is so good it's honest not forced like those films and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids br br when natalie's dad leave home on a business trip jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks with support from natalie's friend polly played exquisitely by maddie corman she lets him but this movie isn't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with the three leads are so natural and the script surprisingly so honest that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking these characters really do care about each other it's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre teen adolescence br br
<START> this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid there is really not much i'd need or want to say here except maybe see this film and enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal who carries you through this neat funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' your own day br br seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day my life it appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming tv shows and ballgames what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person make a difference about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live now on the eighth day at least that was what i got from 'the eighth day'
<START> they are among us is poor science fiction at best mediocre acting bogs down this film the plot holes are numerous aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human in their alien form they supposedly have exo skeletons which is why they need the plastic surgery but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails the heroine's father disappeared after project blue book closed but was supposedly an f 16 pilot and on and on if you want to see an alien invasion movie pick invasion of the body snatchers and see how it is done right
<START> this is peter falk's film period br br i was 10 years old when this film came out i was already a film maven at the time of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out but i was in love with the typeface of its ads the aura that this was an important film okay 34 years later i've finally seen the film having never seen any cassavetes directed film previously he's a hack overall zero sense of timing editing gena's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman's stint in rain man technically on par but entirely one note as tom cruise stole rain man falk takes the cake for this film br br i was annoyed with gena's performance really throughout it seemed better suited for awakenings blecch it's not all her fault she's a basket case from first scene to last we never find out why but falk's character seems real is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man br br shave off at least an hour an editor needed and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple cro magnon man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work yet cannot deal with her three kids her husband's long hours of work br br i'd rather remember cassavetes for the dirty dozen or rosemary's baby he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess as he amply demonstrates with this film br br bob
<START> if you like cb4 you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old school performers definitley rent this movie there aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed
<START> beautifully photographed and ably acted generally but the writing is very slipshod there are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching the fact that the young lover has a twin brother for instance is so contrived that i groaned out loud and the emotion light bulb connection seems gimmicky too br br i don't know though if you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes this is a pretty good movie no major effort on the part of the viewer required but italian film especially italian comedy is usually much much better than this
<START> deliverance is john boorman's 1972 horror thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen burt reynolds jon voight ned beatty and ronnie cox that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed along the way a raft no pun intended of unpleasant things happen to the men despite the nasty happenings in this picture boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely the location was really chosen well indeed this would still be a very nice film to watch had the canoe trip gone smoothly the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible not only is the location scenic but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond it has been said that burt reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman lewis is the star acting role in this film i reckon however that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man ed who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive in fact the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman it was voight himself to cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy eric weissberg's and steve mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance at a couple of other points in the movie we are treated to more softer banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film i did find it a little lacking in purpose it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere nevertheless this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation i did like it but for fans of gore there isn't really much of it none really in fact it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour think of it like rambo first blood meets three men in a boat look out for a very young charley boorman as ed's son i did like this movie the soundtrack cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10
<START> i can't believe this film was allowed to be made these people should be drug out and beat with blunt objects they should be tortured this film is an abomination it's nothing but footage from the first film whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever it's like some sort of drug hallucination like what's with the laying on a mirror naked therapy also whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film because they kept calling suzanna love's character natalie when it's lacey i felt like shouting that at the screen it's lacey it's lacey i give it a 50 out of 10 my god
<START> what an overlooked 80's soundtrack i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls bartenders and immature relationships were in style the best was his lousy texas accent compare that to friday night lights i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film also as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies tom cruise richard pryor robin williams and john travolta
<START> i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing now i am not a prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff his cockney accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent avoid how many more of these films kiss kiss bang bang beautiful creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f word the c word etc does not replace proper dialogue
