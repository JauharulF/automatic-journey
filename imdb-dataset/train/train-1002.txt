<START> there isn't much to say about this film it is horrible br br the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there br br cgi is something you wouldn't like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit br br the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting br br just stay away of this
<START> i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don't be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed br br the description on the back of the box doesn't even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i've lost all faith in humanity br br and don't even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on br br this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans
<START> this crew versus monsta has been done a hundred times sometimes better this one was pretty slow moving only the monster's resurrection was really worthwhile attempts at character developments gets botched by routine yeah routine is the word went straight to video in france no wonder
<START> this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus collapse br br diamond himself comes off as personable and caring not just a disinterested or disengaged academic this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to publish or perish as the saying goes about academe but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects why you white people got so much cargo and we have so little because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community i like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as south park's blame canada blame wheat
<START> i am not sure why i like dolph lundgren i guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent that is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent some of the other reviews point out how dumb detention is but many neglect to point out the positives br br any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens aren't there any other kind of teens does every group of teens have one angry black guy one genius nerd that nobody likes one slutty girl who is very friendly and in this movie pregnant one disturbed anti social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented but what is the talent and one laid back black kid who is in tune with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color they don't say much but get shot at some point br br detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school preferably with the writers inside the dialogue is bad and the plot is worse when the bad guys and girl finally hijack a van full of drugs then they sit inside the van making out they drive the van to the school because they want to re paint the van at the school's paint shop but they never get around to re painting the van by the way it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the police van they also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score br br for some reason they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher dolph lundgren even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours the handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles so why go after them br br anyhow the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns and they keep finding the teens including a guy in a wheel chair and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed for every time someone gets shot there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss the stunts are pretty bad br br i read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of 10 million and i am amazed when i saw the movie i figured maybe lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam it was a test to watch it but i passed
<START> i'm a big fan of movies that make you think i'm still thinking long and hard about this one fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled what's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body made extra tacky by being filmed on cheap video this happens three times and i was certain it would be explained in the end i put my trust in the film makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified it was not br br the movie has to be the most apathetic i've come across in the genre the sets look like a cross between a 1970s dr who set and someone's ill formed idea of a sponge painted living room the lighting is unimaginative if your sets are going to be that bad at least film them in semi darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance of the abducted quartet the girl stands out as being particularly lame but none of them is given a personality the aliens' plans for world domination are just plain silly all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved most of the movie consists of people running down corridors yes it really is that exciting the ray gun special effect is curious to say the least what use is a weapon that takes a 15 second concentrated blast to kill and even then the guy comes back for more the script is like a bad episode of the a team and the ladies' hairstyles come from the same era so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders when we finally get to see what the aliens really look like they're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes the resolution of the story traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home is truly the sign of a writer who's never had an idea more complex than a saturday morning cartoon i mean the bad ones with no plot action or characterization in his or her life br br but seriously what is with the naked chick was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the dvd cover to boost sales
<START> the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 the thing is both lurid and lewd but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way br br the story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few telephone cords a couple of clamps and what looks very like a shallow baking pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body br br as it happens the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks haunting strip joints visiting body beautiful contests and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow but back at the lab the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he hankers for could be leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia leith the unhappy head screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie br br director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with br br now this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone gft amazon reviewer
<START> it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene br br the acting plot cinematography and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them br br the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires not many films can make you feel this creeped out bottom line this movie is a classic i can't really say much more than that
<START> ok i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews but i did enjoy it i didn't laugh out loud but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point the story built yeah you knew it would have an happy ending this genre always does meantime it was quirky with sight gags you could miss so pay attention when you watch stiller and black delivered expertly yet again good team they should work together more don't know that it will be a cult classic but it was certainly a fun ride not as good as what about bob or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie
<START> pickup on south street is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists the action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing the use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality samuel fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by joseph macdonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere br br ace pickpocket and repeat offender skip mccoy richard widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named candy jean peters on the new york subway she was being used by her ex boyfriend joey richard kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her she was carrying us government secrets recorded on microfilm two fbi agents had been following candy and witnessed the theft one of the agents continues to tail her back to joey's apartment and the other zara willis bouchey visits police captain dan tiger murvyn vye zara explains that the fbi has been following candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group br br in order to identify the pickpocket tiger calls in a stoolie called moe thelma ritter who after being given a precise description of the cannon's method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects once tiger sees skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him when skip is brought into tiger's office zara tells him about the microfilm and tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co operate with the investigation skip is flippant and arrogant he clearly doesn't trust tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway br br joey orders candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it candy pays moe for skip's address and when skip returns from being questioned by tiger he finds candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money when she recovers skip demands payment of 25 000 for the microfilm she tells joey about skip's demand and joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening br br skip and candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police it soon becomes apparent however that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action br br the depictions of skip candy and moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling br br moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time she appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as an old clock running down and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in long island her belief that every buck has a meaning of its own leads her to sell any information regardless of danger friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal thelma ritter's performance certainly merited the oscar nomination she earned for her role br br skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again despite this he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely is merely philosophical when moe betrays his whereabouts and then later he even ensures that moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly candy is an ex hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident widmark and peters are both perfect for their roles and like ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction
<START> this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it could've been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karima's mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch her br br the sets were also pretty good i didn't really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india it's as real as it gets br br overall i would give it a thumbs up
<START> possible spoiler in some way how to alienate friends is the loser learns to adjust becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more type of story situated in the celebrity business end of spoiler br br i don't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments though i do think the ending is flawed it felt too fast and too abrupt as if something was missing besides i'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level apart from this you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities until now i've never seen pegg any different still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds don't know whether it was a hard thing to do but her performance was hot and way better than during transformers okay probably that's no tough match kirsten dunst is very much kirsten dunst again and you may like it as i do or find it annoying on the other hand you'll see anderson who proved her acting skills and jeff bridges who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful they all fit their character well enough br br conclusion i think it's a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending
<START> as was to be expected a mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter culture sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and naturally it is childishly anti authoritarian e g the scene on the mexican border when sutherland provokes a custom's officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he sutherland has long hair the constant left wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in today's hollywood one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills a race war so to speak in the middle of l a this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies fortunately some of sutherland's hippie friends make fun of this black revolution premise and the resulting dialogue isn't bad a little later the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation another funny moment is when sutherland's older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school mates and they all say we the black people of the republic of south africa br br there is always a certain amount of self indulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood especially when it's hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies now that's very very self indulgent indeed the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though mazursky throws in the standard flower children and anti vietnam bullshit into the soup and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood but he was is just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he too makes phony small talk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn't know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next left wing project as for his hair he has the worst hair i've seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere it's sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle aged accountant would have if he grew it long the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third if you'd like to read my parody biography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors contact me by e mail
<START> for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal 'that everyone alive has an alter ego' this is true in the mystery of batwoman while the overall story is good i'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this br br throughout the movie you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website so if you haven't seen it already don't go there i was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer 75 minutes is way too short for any movie the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie sort of midway and becomes anti climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over br br i'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie i love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline i also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne also i think the fight with bane should have been done better in typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping falling getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either br br bottom line its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who's a batman fan to watch it it has good storyline universal appeal and even great acting to top it off i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done i'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details br br i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between bruce wayne and barbra gordan he's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and i can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story br br
<START> well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations real americans might appreciate the story line and the action for all the action and intrigue fraulein doktor compares favo u rably to jacob's ladder
<START> what was franco zeffirelli thinking was hollywood responsible for this travesty or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte's classic i don't think i can improve on a comment i read below so i'll just paraphrase it jane eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime it's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast but pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun deleted from the script the marriage proposal the fortune teller gone the allusions half joking half sincerely felt to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair eliminated br br it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane's interactions with the rivers family but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written br br do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series with timothy dalton
<START> i first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993 4 and didn't think much of it then i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson i liked his music before and enjoyed it more now i am older it is a good film but it won't be this classic film like the sound of music west side story the wizard of oz etc michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion
<START> superb cast more please br br if you can catch just about anything else written by plater or starring these wonderful actors for anyone who doesn't know plater has a real feeling for jazz my recommendation is to see the 'beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can br br there's three kinds of jazz hot cool and 'what time does the tune start '
<START> a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities br br it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks i'm not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie br br she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff he's taking photographs and she's translating an esoteric german book about witches i think br br also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couple's children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately br br the hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn't used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder br br people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions br br in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3 ghosthouse la 1988 it's not that's also a better movie than this one la casa 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987 again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 and much better than those there's also a casa 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house 1986 house ii the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 how's the horror show fit in there it doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet
<START> terrible story poor acting and no humour at all apart from the final joke at the end br br some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home supposed to be a kiddies movie but even they will not be amused by this terrible film
