<START> this movie really surprised me i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute br br it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal man lover and husband if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you br br the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes but in the end i think it made everything better the ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise br br as for the acting i think it was good it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye gil bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining shaun parkes portrait of bellows prison mate clinique is great and extremely powerful on the downside i think i will put esai morales portrait of markie br br take my advice and watch this movie either you will love it or dislike it
<START> the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre screening not that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment but that was my limit br br like other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot br br tara fitzgerald's casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history br br as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn't sit through it again either br br
<START> a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children's film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children's fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war br br the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals those whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then liberate br br the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them br br in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformed br br this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though i've focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a children's film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more often br br all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performances the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex instant classic
<START> russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 william powell is casting his epic about the russian revolution and hires an old ex general from the czarist regime emil jannings to play the general of the film and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared evelyn brent of 11 years before br br try as i might i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues 'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see but 'the last command' is rather heavy going the premise is fascinating but the treatment does really make the script come to life except in the sequences set in hollywood depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state of the art technology br br emil jannings is predictably a marvelous russian general distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex general transfixed in his misery and the vigorous hearty officer of yore br br the ending is great and worth the wait but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
<START> i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie
<START> i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out br br since i had already seen the original when i saw this on sci fi channel i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi i knew what it was within the first few minutes since i like richard burgi as a character actor i wanted to see how he would pull it off br br the writers producers etc modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the aliens they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's maybe it added a bit of polish to the film or not br br this film film this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place although no resolution of the alien's problem br br i sort of remember that in this remake the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi alien i think it could have ended better but the ending is just the ending and the yarn is a swell yarn being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film br br this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi this one came off well i actually enjoyed this quite a bit br br but if anyone really wants to see this story told well i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott directed by gene fowler jr
<START> if you lived through the 60s this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous it's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin for the times they are a changin' while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it's dissemination at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia influencing engineers scientists and aiding in the hyper development of computer related activities a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there you've captured the era better than i've seen before
<START> i'll keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one it's very nearly perfect in my view jmv
<START> a warning to potential viewers if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story the most dangerous game look elsewhere seven women for satan br br only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of zaroff and having said character murder people br br some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers or not br br boris zaroff is played by writer director michel lemoine whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves the film rambles from scene to scene with a near total lack of clarity the director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film a few individual scenes are mildly interesting such as a torture rack sequence but as a unit the film fails to entertain viewers who are more br br interested in an assortment of attractive and semi attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable most will probably find their time is better spent watching mentos commercials br br in a side note the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history apparently it was banned for several years in its native france which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution
<START> an entertaining kung fu film with acting plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists alexander fu sheng's proto jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills for me the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast at times things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might wish br br but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count the film climaxes with a high bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent br br overall shaolin temple is an enjoyable low budget kung fu movie not up to the quality of a good jet li film but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre my rating 8 10 br br misc notes the 1987 warner home video release i saw was predictably poorly dubbed and lacked full cast crew credits
<START> i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once but trust me it is br br i haven't seen the old movie but why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television
<START> i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set i am watching them with my soon to be seven year old daughter which makes most of these movies a laugh riot br br i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies after watching white zombie which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema think clive barker's serpent and the rainbow and james bond's live and let die funeral scene not night of the living dead br br however even though the title includes the word zombies it is little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist armand louque who is smitten with claire duval who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson what a yawn fest my daughter fell asleep half way through br br i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for the allies or the axis but i guess that doesn't really matter br br i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie but of course those were his eyes from white zombie serving as the mind control device for the zombies
<START> ok as everyone has pointed out this film is a complete dog to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised or darkened down to near invisibility to escape the censor's x rating but the film has many other flaws as well br br to begin with the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up the baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing in fact the whole confusing and poorly presented plot is something that has already been done for vampires but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie br br secondly the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy br br there are a couple of slightly good bits i actually quite liked the score others have mentioned sybil danning's tits and br br spoiler if such a thing can exist br br i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters i mean you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together hmm but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti lycanthrope weapons
<START> i'm a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion good clean fun good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were and how innocent is diagnosis murder i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix the bad guys always get caught the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously br br one beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches amanda was too dizzy its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy br br i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens esp at lunchtimes
<START> this would've been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i'm doing really big acting sort of way br br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy br br mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldn't tear my eyes away this dialogue might've worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work br br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace br br this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera br br imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 br br character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn't character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that's a plot contrivance br br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do br br oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me i'm the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory br br don't say you weren't warned
<START> sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful before sunrise 1995 the third movie of richard linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it it is one of the very rare movies that is should will be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes two young people in their early 20s two college students american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne meet on a train they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night they talk and fall in love that's it that's the movie it could've been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is julie delpy who looks like a botticelli's angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman
<START> 96 minutes of this is cruel and i love the old munster's yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much 'intrigue' and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if it's an old starsky hutch episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid 60's ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an addam's family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party br br grandpa herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours preposterous sid ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience it's not laughable it's sad oh and the best part yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a car or a train lily says responds with something like you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track what's amazing about this is yvonne decarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never recovered and this financially devastated her family check out biography's fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her br br if you are a real fan of the munster's then you'll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago
<START> i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t r took me on to the journey well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors i do not know who played the young her but she was great and so was uma br br the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour i was with a friend and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends and we both enjoyed it too the maximum hilarious laughs sadness about the realistic police normalos both of us fans of t robbins books i found it well done thought that robbins would also approve though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not br br i would love to see the cut out stuff i heard that gus v sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first time viewers or the producers well still it is an artistic movie much too short though it is one of my all time favorites and i am aware of it that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think what a pity hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material hoping to see more of crispian keanu expecting to see her baby and all br br if you have the chance to see it think twice and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch m
<START> i can appreciate what barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house i couldn't help but think when is this gonna end a very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes i had only seen a part of cremaster 3 on dvd and thought i knew what to expect that said experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments there are a couple of beautiful horrible images including the title sequence no kidding but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning then you are in for a long snooze inducing ride i managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that's a compliment but more often than not i was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative big mistake among the collection of images are a very ornate gift wrapping ceremony the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it and the mutual evisceration of bjork and director matthew barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion followed by their transformation into whale like creatures the soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying sometimes even maddening at one time there is a song being sung by bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high pitched instrument which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie if this sounds like it doesn't make sense that is because is doesn't if this sounds like your cup of tea then you will absolutely love it if this sounds like something that you probably won't like then stay far away from it because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening i attended this is the very definition of an art film you get from it what you take from it but otherwise there really isn't much there other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals i'm glad that there is a place for films such as this but i can't say i would want to sit through it again however i can't say i wouldn't want to see one of barney cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this i think perhaps now that i know what to expect i might enjoy something like this more to give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has i probably would've liked it better if i had gotten stoned then again it could've felt twice as long as it was and then it would've really gotten ponderous definitely not for everyone
<START> i really like this movie bozz is an ultra cool not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch 22 joseph heller's classic novel about men and war this film however is not set in a war zone but in a pre war combat prep training this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause br br colin farrell is brilliant as bozz a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him bozz is totally cool and non plussed testing and tweaking his military superiors getting their goat at every opportunity he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree saving his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need the way out of this man's army br br the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a sleeper tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion br br five stars a top pick
