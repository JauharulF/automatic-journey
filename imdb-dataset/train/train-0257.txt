<START> this is one of the best of the genre i saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then it rivals the zatoichi series also starring katsu in exciting swordplay
<START> this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways br br directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences br br this film is a german italian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of course br br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller
<START> the person's comment that said that pat robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is his definition of evil is the opposite of evil the bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good he doesn't even know that he fulfilled bible prophecy if you don't know god and refuse to know him now that's okay he still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to him and you will it will be too late for you god sends no one to hell not even you you will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it may god have mercy on you and give you a damascus road experience the 700 club and pat robertson's ministry is one of the reasons i'm still here on the edge of alcoholism adultery and probably death god reached through the tv screen and used pat robertson to do it and thank god he did you have a right to say what you said but you don't have a right to curse with your words god have mercy on you
<START> overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last foreverÂ there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time Â very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break that's how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why Â i have no idea must be the jewish themeÂ
<START> john singleton's finest film before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake this is a thought provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters each with identifiable youngster problems br br what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social economical problems and racism by whites this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist br br the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow it's not just about racism but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world college date rape discovering sexuality and isolation omar epps michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez yay and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots br br the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne peppermint surely plenty of professors are nutty but they're not as flat the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature but i guess they are like that too in real life br br overall a great underrated piece of filmwork if you liked american history x you'll love this one br br 8 5 out of 10
<START> i view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year if not ever however i have not actually seen quest of the delta knights yet this movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because i had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn't walk out br br do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer
<START> this italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them they show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely this movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film explaining evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull
<START> this production never really got off the ground for me the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you've read the novel or seen a better adaptation like the 1995 one with amanda root you're going to be a bit lost since there's no time for character development br br i liked sally hawkins as anne but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been mrs croft was far too old as was anne's elder sister elizabeth mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost much better was sophie thompson's mary whose selfishness and sense of ill usage is so well established that by the time wentworth suggests anne stay with the injured louisa and mary objects that she as louisa's sister in law should stay instead you can't imagine anyone less suited to do so in this version she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production br br rupert penry jones is nice to look at but he made a much better st john rivers 1995 jane eyre probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor likewise the accident scene it happens so fast and with so little context you wonder what all the fuss is about and moving the speech that wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script br br my other problem with this version was the lighting sometimes everything looked like a scene from the csi morgue very very blue other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well like when anne visits her old school friend mrs smith who by the way is supposed to be more or less paralyzed having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr elliot's awful character was such a violation that for a minute i couldn't think who she was i thought she was one of the musgrove girls and she might as well have been all the girls were pretty much interchangeable and the running scene at the end in an era where propriety was at a premium it's hard to imagine gentle anne tearing all over bath like some demented hoyden how silly can you get it's too bad sally hawkins had all the makings of a good anne elliot but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over truncated production
<START> rich in love is a slice of life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky charleston sc family highly romanticized beautifully shot well written and acted ril washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at film's end you'll feel like an old friend of the family br br a wonderfully crafted character driven film from the director of driving miss daisy ril is a somewhat obscure little sleeper which will appeal most to mature audiences
<START> halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child he takes out his problems on his older sister whom he murders at the beginning of the film this is just the start of things to come from michael myers br br donald pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying myers for years he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil this evil will not be contained and it cannot be stopped br br after an escape from an institution myers tracks down his younger sister if he kills her there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs br br there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer but this one started it all sort of if you think about it most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls well if it wasn't for halloween those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children br br halloween's director john carpenter got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer br br this film may seem clichÃ© today but back then there wasn't much out there like this it's been copied from and ripped off of but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie it still gives you chills listening to carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers
<START> i really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator
<START> for a slasher flick this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre yes it is predictable resident nut job goes on killing spree people die yada yada yada however there are some good positives in this film first off i really liked the mask the nut job wore it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made also the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept as far as i know i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko for most of the murders the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre but that'a small concern the movie does not take itself seriously which is something most slashers suffer from oddly enough while watching the movie i was reminded of the early friday the 13th films which did take themselves seriously there are a few concerns about this movie in several scenes the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons by this i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot and also the way he walked of bigger concern however is a scene very close to the end where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance actually a complete rip off of another famous horror titan and in the very last scenes we have our scumbag once again looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip off from another icon in the slasher genre these scenes were weak and unoriginal obviously by the way the movie is set in australia so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent like me you'll be in heaven if you not than it just might grate on you one other great thing about this movie beautiful kylie minogoue just don't get too attached to her there is one non aussie accent courtesy of molly ringwald overall there are more reasons to watch than not i enjoyed it and had some fun so i have to give cut 8 10 which may seem too high to some people
<START> i really can't remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one like rubbernecking at a highway accident br br someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton's in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldn't help but think how bad was it before it's a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating
<START> iÂ´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from uma thurman which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality itÂ´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews this movie deserves it
<START> i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l a weekly i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film the film stars molly parker from my favorite television show deadwood and lukas haas who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future the film is funny heartwarming features great acting and beautiful photography i don't know if the film has distribution but i hope it does or will soon this is destined to be a real indie gem it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening even without her there this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival
<START> what a disappointment piper perabo is adorable tyra banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria bello is wasted bello must have been embarrassed by some of the lines the plot script and premise is a joke br br i'm not against silly movies i think that something about mary is a masterpiece but coyote ugly is a waste of 90 minutes
<START> as far as spaghetti westerns go i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre it's not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen guy madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn't particularly good the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before there's just not much to get very excited about br br the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes note the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead she is the character melin i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie
<START> this movie is incredible with great characters specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool br br very very recommendable not for the smallest children though this one deserves a 10
<START> when anyone comes into a film of this type of film it's not without saying that an overdose of that great over the counter brain medicine suspension of disbelief comes in mighty handy br br jeanette macdonald plays two roles anna brigitta the woman who nelson eddy has ignored since the beginning of time but who also is an angel sent to earth br br my reaction when i saw this was a mute gasp of hunh where have i seen this before it turns out i have seen it before but in a movie made much later than this one date with an angel a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one emmanuelle beart who had no speaking lines also wore a blond wig and made life hell for soap actor michael knight much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey br br anyway not to elaborate this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time macdonald and eddy neither very good actors but terrific singers would be together playing up the innocence and clean cut romance that they were known for after that you may need a cold shower not because there are any steamy scenes here but to get rid of the memory
<START> deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn't make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can't catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching
