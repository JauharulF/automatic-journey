<START> i love this show period i haven't been watching very long probably only about six months or so actually but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters except i don't really care for donna i'm not completely sure why i just don't find her funny and i don't think laura prepon is a very good actress other than her i find the rest of the cast pretty good kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp who played erics parents were extremely funny topher grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans i did not completely hate the 8th season i still watch it and it does make me laugh but if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons its not good randy is horrible the finale was decent nothing amazing but good i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes in my opinion were 'dine dash' 'grandmas dead' 'red stacey' and 'streaking' but i love every episode i've seen so far which is most of them i think 9 10 stars i would definitely recommend it
<START> i don't know what some of you are smoking but i suspect it's potent br br to call swept away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness the acting is hideous and i'm not picking on madonna here we all know she's useless but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines the editing is so sloppy it beggars description the photography and composition which in this era competence should be a given for any film with a budget are astonishingly inept even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking these are basic elements of filmmaking if you can't get them right you should seek another line of work it's as contrived as a grade 3 production of snow white except nowhere near as well made or interesting br br the original film by lina wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor superbly acted and written featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair the sexual tension feels real and immediate those of you who found guy ritchie's version deplorable should see it it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema br br those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined
<START> magic isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention seldom are we soaked in beauty like this as if that weren't enough it's funny performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson and the superb josie walker both open like roses br br why isn't this film on dvd it deserves to live forever
<START> this is another typical unbelievable and non sensical piece of hollywood dreck br br kurt russell as snake pliskin in a business suit convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victim br br every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something knocking him down and out kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end of the movie embrace and everybody except russell and stowe knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again br br he does of course and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more slobbery they get
<START> my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires since we have indian blood he connects to this movie on january 27th he will turn 47 years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him he lives in thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs can you help me obtain this movie thanking you in advance dolly crout soto deerfield beach fl
<START> i honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now death and making fun of death violence sexual innuendo adults threatening children crudeness alcohol abuse by minors drug theft dysfunctional parents babysitter from hell stereotypical jokes about african americans police and fat people and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night yup sure sounds like a kids movie to me not add to that the dark and scary elements a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood how sweet for kids parents is this really what you want your kids to be watching is this what you want to teach them about life br br this movie is too scary for young kids and i'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario so why rub it in their faces as for an adult audience you won't find it scary or amusing just boring contrived and predictable and the characters are just wrong clueless parents ignorant police stupid and annoying friends nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drinking womanizing boyfriends what great material for kids does this really sound like a children's movie to anyone even the computer animation and good voice work aren't enough to redeem this terrible flick save your money save your time and save your children's minds go rent ice age monsters inc the incredibles shrek a bug's life any of them are way better than this horrid film spielberg and zemeckis shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's family movie
<START> trying to conceive of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holes br br michael douglas stars as pete garrison a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the whitehouse family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger l a confidential troubles arise as we see pete's close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david rasche united 93 when pete fails a polygraph test he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david breckinridge kiefer sutherland 24 tv series br br as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only confidant is the first lady and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the polygraph in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service br br the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassin s want to kill the prez hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere br br and what's with david breckinridge's kiefer's new partner jill marin eva longoria carlita's way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a candy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low cut blouse br br there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily stymied by the what the responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie
<START> although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies i find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because i'm from a different era and a different country but i found crosby's continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying don't get me wrong i'm not anti american whatsoever but it seemed that the english could do no right and or needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way it's a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time it's the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time br br i watched another crosby movie last night the emperor's waltz and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife who for what's it's worth is american found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy roosevelt as she put it br br as for the premise of the movie it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid picture moe of the three stooges br br all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie
<START> after i watched the films i thought why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office even thought the movie had a clever unusal scenario the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting for a korean movie i liked the fighting scenes if you want to watch a film without thinking this is the film for you but i got to admit the film was kind of childish 6 10
<START> all this dismaying waste of film stock needs is count floyd popping up every sixty seconds somehow they got steve railsback susan anspach john vernon and joe flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles about eight kilometers of an actual movie boy does this thing suck there isn't one original line thought shot or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close the magical ethereal susan anspach of five easy pieces boring steve railsback boring john vernon boring the big bug boring if this is a scary movie buttercream gang is a thuglife documentary br br seriously every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness usually it's in the opening credits written directed and produced by one guy or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made here you don't find out till the very last of the credits where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the canadian government is gratefully acknowledged br br right now i'm watching mst's take on beast of yucca flats to get the taste out of my mouth ghod what an improvement
<START> who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days 'the young victoria' not only chronicles the young queen's romance with her husband to be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne br br the act i 'set up' draws you in right away following the death of victoria's father the duke of kent in 1820 less than a year after victoria's birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen to be conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious 'kensington system' rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up what's more victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became queen br br the film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act which established that victoria's mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strong willed victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victoria's contact with the king in an over the top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent br br king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother br br 'the young victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victoria's coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queen's trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivals br br the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of 'the bedchamber crisis' in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchess's ladies in waiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings' alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantÂwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victoria's inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affair br br the rest of the 'the young victoria' deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisis br br i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queen's husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had in laws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court there's a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years albert's struggle was the same for philipÂas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever popular wives br br fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs albert doesn't want a second 'bedchamber crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving victoria's bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened br br the performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victoria's depression after albert's death but 'victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson
<START> not sure why this film was advertised as a wild quirky laugh filled comedy there is not much in this movie that will entertain nor amuse the moviegoer annette bening whose acting was touted as being oscar worthy comes off here as mannered with her performance seeming routine brian cox's character is confusing and irritating and the lead playing augusten Â joseph cross Â appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role the best thing about the film is evan rachel wood but she is not enough to endorse this boring unsavory film br br the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason i found some of the scenes distasteful the scene with brian cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'you and me and everyone we know' and 'the squid and the whale' some embarrassing and most of them unsettling i found the whole experience a waste of time don't you waste your timeÂ
<START> richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capote's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffman's oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote i'd suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience
<START> the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark and if they are both there run for your life however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously it starts out bad and goes downhill from there repeated scenes the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter yes he's the best deputy sheriff in texas tracking a mafia hit man to malta as only he can he makes his own rules does things his own way all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style you want to see a bad but funny film go ahead on its your move
<START> director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience br br morgan sullivan jeremy northam a stay at home husband with an overbearing wife decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high tech company digi corp his job is to travel to conferences across the country under the assumed identity of jack thursby and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses via a nifty little electronic pen gizmo br br in reality however the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities morgan along with his fellow conference attendees is being brainwashed the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities once they are totally convinced that they are someone else they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion br br but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative for hire rita foster lucy liu who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby then he will be 'eliminated' morgan plays along and applies for a job at rival business sunways br br however arriving at his new workplace he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy fortunately the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent br br from hereon in things get progressively more complicated the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone in an exciting finale all eventually becomes clear but only if you've been following events very carefully br br director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast jeremy northam in particular is fantasticÂhis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection br br cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects high rise and necropolis
<START> my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boy's perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy's scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depth br br melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the well fed priest squeezing money from parishioners a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome what's more the jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners br br much of the film was predictable who didn't think that we'd see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet i'm a fan of british realism if it's done well in my opinion liam is not br br
<START> wow br br i picked this up at the local wal mart after reading online that it had been released early i've been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film br br wow br br i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof time and again characters usually the narrator and whoever he is with are shown walking and walking and walking i am not an editor but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b there is no need to show almost the entire journey wow br br i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date br br wow br br why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of according to the end credits the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including london at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera in one shot in london there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair br br wow br br why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me it is a turkey plain and simple on the plus side at least for me it has provided some of the most genuine laugh out loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while
<START> i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well i found it strange and completely pointless so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it wow what a difference the original one was way better i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it's existence did have a purpose it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but a lot better
<START> now for the truth its very very weak storyline for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it and they don't after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if you've got some spare time don't waste it on this
