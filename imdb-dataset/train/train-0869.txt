<START> mere thoughts of going overboard aka babes ahoy make me want to weep throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie it's not even a supposed so bad it's good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it oh the pain the pain
<START> fever pitch is a fun enough movie it has a lot of funny moments including a hilariously disturbing shower scene like most romantic comedies it has a dead zone in the middle where all the heavy she's breaking up with me stuff happens but other than that it continues to be funny until the end br br even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox it's not overloaded with sports you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film br br of course that's easy for me to say i've been a red sox fan since i was a boy too br br 7 out of 10 br br barky
<START> a nice shirely temple short child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for aside from that this is fun given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing from a social viewpoint that strike me as both very progressive and liberal i won't go into those here i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove
<START> intelligent stylish and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films br br when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer br br dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish' it's a truly edge of your seat shocker even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own dressed to kill is also a very erotic film but mainly in a strangely beautiful way pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film br br the cast is another strong feature of this film michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill fated housewife nancy allen's performance as an involved street walker is solid a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son br br many criticize de palma's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality as calling this film a 'rip off' would be degrading to a fine thriller dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans br br out of
<START> this movie is hilarious i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again this movie is not for you movie goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards you know who you are i won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews br br whipped is a light hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends not your girlfriend it won't win any awards but it just has to be watched to be appreciated true some of the jokes are toilet humor but that is not necessarily a bad thing everyone can use some of it sometimes some people need to lighten up and see whipped for what it is not what it isn't br br 1 4 out of
<START> although the likeliness of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80 for this movie is low i feel that i have to say something about this one i am not the kind of movie watcher who pays attention to production value thought provoking dialog or brilliant acting directing however i claim that this movie sucks i don't know why i don't like it i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie blood outrageousness unintentional humor etc according to this evidence it should be my favorite still zombi 3 is a baaad movie br br there are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water this spoils nothing so don't worry she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something did she not see that there was a friggin' lake in the middle of the building yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake why cuz she wants to know why the people who aren't there cuz the place is abandoned won't answer her when she calls out is anybody there oh this is just a little insignificant piece of the big picture i'm painting br br there is a reason though why i gave this film more than 1 star it's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is like i have a few times you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over the top in every aspect i called it blood in the first paragraph but this movie has no blood it has an ocean of gore also it has pretty weird creatures in it as well a zombie baby with an adult size hand and a magically flying head to name just two br br you know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci fi movies i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those it has all the elements scientists arguing with the government warnings of the apocalypse on the radio armies battling monsters and so on this is the plan 9 of the '80's while i won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it just expect the very worst and when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating zombi 3 it won't be all that bad you might actually like it i'm not saying that's impossible br br don't think i hate this movie i don't really oh p s killing birds aka zombie 5 rules did i just blow my credibility
<START> given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing so br br if you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camera work my 92 year old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plot narrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i can't believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didn't tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date br br okay so the budget is low that doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the 'score' is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writers directors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from sweden br br the most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
<START> after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes though i guess not if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever though they couldn't they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either
<START> i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 back when the tickets actually sold for 1 this is the only film i have ever walked out on with my friend while the idiocy that is the laser bra 2000 sketch was on screen evidently my and my friend's reaction to the film was a common one it is not that i found the film offensive either as an 18 year old or now but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it rather than a failure to comprehend mr mike's vision unless of course his vision was to drive the film's backers into bankruptcy br br i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published 10 worst films of all time list it certainly makes mine you have been warned
<START> as this happens to be one of most favorite novels i was very excited to see the move i was not disappointed yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on but i think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review but this is one of the good ones it is such a dark story which i guess is why i like it and what is better than the dead coming to life and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book it is a well written screen play the actors could have done a better job i only say this for rachel and ellie she was so whinny i liked everyone else a lot and most important to me it stuck true with the novel
<START> i rented this movie on dvd i knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case but once i saw that leatherface gunnar hansen was in it i had to rent it it starts off pretty good with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable however the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging there are way too many unanswered questions there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise but overall this is a very sub par movie but i guess it was worth the 3 99 rental fee
<START> in the white balloon and crimson gold the two other films by jafar panahi that i've seen the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem on the surface slight in offside panahi's seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights i don't think he's as successful not that what he's saying isn't important of course and it's too bad that like pretty much every other panahi film iranians can't see it but after a while the film feels a tad flat and it feels long even at 90 minutes not saying i didn't like it though the actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious but it's not an important work in my opinion
<START> this movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen but it's got quite a bit of quality it's pretty lifelike yet you think it's only a movie duvall and close portray common people and you'd never even realize they are now big name actors it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing eugene's girlfriend but i guess it's possible it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to nevada by himself but i guess it's possible you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but i guess it's possible i remember glenn close saying something like you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isn't
<START> i must admit that i have been a sucker for samurai flicks since i can remember i used to watch rather indiscriminate be it elitist works like the seven samurai or the bloody comic book variation like lone wolf and cub i also liked us japanese crossovers like the bushido blade and of course everything containing sonny chiba and hiroyuki sanada and i've virtually watched every samurai at least twice but not kabuto br br in 1993 i first watched kabuto on video that even samurai films can be boring in the beginning i was looking forward to mayeda reaching europe and the confrontations that would come from that but by the time he actually reached spain i really didn't care so much for the movie anymore br br it wouldn't do the film justice to call it bad technically it's a clean entry into the genre but there is simply never quiet enough sho kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of above mentioned japanese actors charisma and speaking of sho kosugis son kane who appears in almost all sho kosugi films as shos son he has inherited little to none of his fathers limited acting skills adding to the minus points is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all samurai film this was obviously intended for a younger us european audience br br lets just say that it's a so so film for the average historic action adventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of samurai cinema fans who are into the samurai meets Â genre should rather go and watch red sun 1971 featuring charles bronson as cowboy who has to team up with samurai toshiro mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from bad guy alan delon it pretty much how to do it right and where kabuto went wrong br br so even though the film is a mere 100 minutes it seems like a much longer film br br the reason i gave this a honourable 4 10 points instead of 3 10 first time i saw this film i saw it in the german synchronized version in this version kosugi can actually be understood i must admit that his 'engrish' is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes
<START> there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it br br it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music score br br i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection
<START> it's like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like and to stir up like contro like versy and make us more like money and like stuff ellen the lost quote br br kissing like on the like mouth and stuff is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made watching like ellen's hairy arms and like chris masturbating was like the height of my years long movie viewing experience and stuff but before i like begin like breaking new u s 20 something airhead records with the my likes let me like just briefly list like the high like lights of this visual like feast br br 1 chris doing the deed with his genitals and not just that the way the camera guided so elegantly by ellen and patrick rewards the viewer with a full screen shot of chris's fat white trash stomach after he finishes the un catholic deed that was truly thrilling i can in all honesty say that i've never seen such grace chris you should do more such scenes in your next movies because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant brilliant man lars von trier and his idiots 95 started a quick w and then a hairy fat white belly what more can any movie goer ask for needless to say i can sit all day and watch chris ejaculate in spite of the fact that i'm straight such poetry in motion such elegance such style no less than total divine inspiration went into filming that sequence plus a solid amount of zen philosophy even barbra streisand could not get any more spiritual than this br br 2 ellen's hairy thick arms the wobbly camera close ups so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography i can't emphasize this enough ellen and patrick often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question there were several scenes when we would see a part of a body a leg arm or foot yet it was often a guessing game does that body part belong to a man or a woman naturally chris and his fellow artists ellen patrick and whatsername cast themselves on purpose because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender based confusion it was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements so hairless and pristine whereas ellen and the other girl are so very butch what with their thick legs and arms brilliant br br 3 brilliant especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes so utterly original and mind blowing ellen behaves like a man wants sex all the time while her ex patrick wants to talk like a girl spiffing br br 4 ellen's search for a leftist mate he must love 'the simpsons' which is quite leftist i am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change the number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal 3 849 to be exact they have managed to realistically transfer their real life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort and i applaud them for that br br 5 the close ups of toes plenty of stuff here for foot fetishists which i think is a very liberal highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities after all shoe and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema so it's nice to see that someone out there cares br br kotm or rather klotlmas offers more than meets the eye it is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations no it's much more than that it's about the light that guides all silly creatures the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school and plan to assault our senses with dim witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like sundance and cannes enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change with which they will later hire the likes of sean penn and george clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of all political problems this world faces what better way to do that than by making porn at the very start br br if chris and ellen did the camera here as is clearly stated in the end credits then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it they probably hired some passers by and shoved the camera into their hands br br go to http rateyourmusic com fedor8 and check out my tv cinema 150 worst cases of nepotism list
<START> the french film extension du domaine de la lutte directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq he has also worked on this film's scenario according to british cinema magazine sight and sound it is also known as whatever this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall beware some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists

<START> this movie is just plain terrible poor john savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club she acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair this movie just gets all to crazy with savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head also one of the rare he quotes the elephant man and jimmy durante and i just had to laugh this just gets rediculas and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth and you can tell that that is all to fake her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity i enjoy a good vampire film believe me i do but i just hated this one even the photography stinks in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of corri around till he blinds himself avoid this one
<START> i went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack and slash films rampant on the screen these days boy was i surprised this little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber dark atmosphere more surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown as with most good movies this one leaves something to the imagination and bill paxton did a superb job at directing scenes shot inside the car as are well done and after watching the anatomy of a scene episode at the end of the video tape it was good to see that some of the subtle yet wonderful things i had noticed were intentional and not just an oh that looks good keep it type of direction this is a moody movie filled with grimness still for the dark subject a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight even some of the more disturbing scenes the acting is exceptional okay i've always been a fan of powers booth and never goes over the top au contraire it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film if there is any one area where this film lacks it is in the ending which seems just a bit too contrived but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie what is the message it's something that each individual decides for themself overall on the 1 10 scale this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre ie body heat or midnight in the garden of good and evil and about a 5 for those who don't
