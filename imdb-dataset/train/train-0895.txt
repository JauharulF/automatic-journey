<START> a family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father's coffee table book come across an ancient decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one eyed man when their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow they're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior br br there have been many films in the 'freak' subgenre of horror ranging from tod browning's beloved 'freaks' 1932 to alex winter's hilarious 'freaked' 1993 those are both classics or soon to be with 'freaked' 'side sho ' however never will be and if it ever does reach classic status well it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre from the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17 year old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother this film did not have much going for it the writing was subpar but not completely awful just boring the direction was poor and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable the acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long long time there was far from enough gore violence to make up for the lack of any other quality and when there was a bit of violence it was not well done at all and i can't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were with all honesty some of the worst i've ever ever seen in a film overall this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin br br final verdict 2 5 10
<START> comment this movie is impossible is terrible very improbable bad interpretation e direction not look
<START> as i sat subjected to this televised mediocrity i wondered why why did dianne keaton agree to this trash the movie uses meaningless contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands the movie takes a political agenda to a new level the movie was meaningless and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype br br it was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd i hope that you did not waste your new year's day watching another mindless made for tv movie i now know why the networks started airing series on sunday night to rid us of trash
<START> the same difficulty i have with the musical version of les miserables applies equally to oliver instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings they merely wrote broadway type melodies which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed br br too the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score it's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste br br the casting of the boy oliver doesn't help matters tentative of timbre and vexingly precious there's something less than solid here fagin performs his traditional routine adequately though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner br br as long as he needs me is given a strident rendition throaty and strained the two big production numbers who will buy and consider yourself seem over produced with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it's one thing to go all out yet another to cross over the line into excess br br the gloom despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography while the novel is considered a classic i must confess i have trouble with mr dickens' consciousness in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life which was full of disappointment and regret br br not all the combined talent of this production either on or behind camera can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me br br
<START> adrian pasdar is excellent is this film he makes a fascinating woman
<START> as one other imdb reviewer has remarked this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy however the juxtapositioning of the wife's career as a rising blues singer against the husband's gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while she's away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done utilizing a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past again very freudian is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda's plight this aspect of the story elicits the cast is excellent i think br br
<START> christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film's end this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs the devil to the gateway to hell to bizarre rituals to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film we get ava gardner burgess meredith chris sarandon jerry orbach deborah raffin arthur kennedy jose ferrer slyvia miles beverly deangelo eli wallach martin balsam christopher walkin william hickey tom berenger jeff goldblum and who can forget john carradine as the old priest many of these actors ham it up particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles was that really necessary i think not also the father daughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments the scenes with carradine are particularly effective
<START> cut tries to be like most post scream slashers tried to be a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies now i am not bagging 'scream ' as i think 'scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy cut fails on most levels it has its moments but overall it just does not work out not even as a so bad it's good movie just a below average one br br the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well apart from the fact that kylie minogue can't really act and ironically she gets her tongue out go figure go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off which is apparently cursed and as you have probably predicted one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman br br unoriginal plot poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow there is plenty of referencing in the film everything from 'scream' to 'the texas chain saw massacre ' this isn't smart either it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it really i should be supporting this movie because i'm australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror we do have our gems though but cut is definitely not one of them br br however it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so so that is something good at least i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for but if you are looking for a good movie stay away br br 2 5
<START> this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway but it is close that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book this director's films of 3 i have seen i find them all to be miserable like the cook whatever positive cinematic flourishes he displays are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation
<START> in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments i'd like to offer some advice free of charge from a viewer's perspective if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film do it if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films go ahead do not try to make both at the same time it doesn't work for example having a goofy comic relief character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make this one is boring meandering cheap racist you get the picture a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower way too prissy here are hardly worth your trouble there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence 1 2
<START> i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'anglaise in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much monsieur le directeur rohmer
<START> why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over again br br this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasn't embracing my inner masochist br br as bucatinsky's writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never acquainted with eli's masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although tom's psycho emotional sadism is highly evident
<START> this is my first movie review on imdb i was forced to register after watching this movie i cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me the people must be warned br br first of all my rating is 0 as in zero br br i love jack black ben stiller rachel weis and christopher walken and yet i hated this movie there is a plot but who cares when there's no script the dialogue is unreal and plain boring the situations are contrived the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting and the story although based on a good premise is stupid this movie is a piece of poo br br never mind wasting money on this movie it's not even worth your time spent watching it please do not see it i beg of you
<START> poorly written conspiracy drama mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade d
<START> i went into this with my hopes up by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn't have been more let down despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake i kept my hopes high that maybe just maybe someone would get it right this time around sadly prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake bad script bad direction cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror br br from beginning to end it's boring repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls we've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this if you go to see prom night in the theater i'd say wait for the dvd or ppv get ready for the audience to laugh because laugh they will the laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie seriously was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof the film makers missed the mark so badly here that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie which in retrospect i wish i had done not me though i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better needless to say it didn't the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it but still came out of it with a micro budget movie i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere br br this movies scary alright if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed
<START> there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent this was one of those times i almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure and i wish i had br br the pace that a man goes from a straight laced controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid br br from a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price jesse metcalfe man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman by violence and by mind altering substances of course the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april nathalie kelley but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand br br frankly besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena this film has no redeeming qualities save your money save your time do anything else
<START> its not as good as the first movie but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion br br
<START> this movie has it all it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of cuban refugees antonio montana played by al pacino is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of miamis' drug empire is astonishing brian depalma does an amazing job directing this picture so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline as well as every character in the cast with tony's characters' pressence being so believable and strong brian depalma brang out the raw talent exposed by steven bauer manny tony's best friend mary elizabeth mastantonio gina tony's sister robert loggia frank tony's boss and michelle pfeiffer elvira frank's wife i enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still watch it on a weekly basis on this year the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie i for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers with other crime movies being so dramatic i find this movie is a shock to the system
<START> the critics didn't like this film it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain which was a great shame because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first br br nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from 'the graduate' and 'birthday girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic despite being a totally different story br br sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but it's memorable moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega budget blockbuster br br see it with an open mind
<START> oh my god oh my god i cant get over this movie it was god awful horrible terrible don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin no avoid it at all costs i'm warning you br br it was the worst movie i've ever seen in my life in my life br br first of all g girl are you kidding me get real that sounds like some kind of new barbie doll super women are you kidding me it was so fake fake fake fake the people of the town didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire ohh big br br jesus was it just me or did this movie seem offensive i guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double d's blonde flowing hair no glasses and a leather skin tight suit br br if it was trying to be romantic than god i don't know it was horrid if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed and in the air than they totally had love br br it was pathetic everything went too fast first that guy was single than he was dating g girl than they broke up than he dated that hannah girl and it just goes on br br i have to say this movie made me wonder how the hell did they get this in theaters br br avoid this movie at all costs
