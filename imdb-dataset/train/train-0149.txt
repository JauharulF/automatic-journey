<START> i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5 2 br br not only does guy bring together a b list ish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination br br far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable br br this film is special get it now
<START> interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work br br when you see the film maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did i didn't really know who to root for in the movie taye diggs looked bored as the detective the rest of the characters seem so one dimensional and unpleasant br br if the victim alicia mia kirschner had been more of a nice girl we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead i can't understand the moral message of this film and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work
<START> although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances it is certainly not when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies and i was right br br stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie the storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat like every tale it has some short of morality therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria the material girl who is shallow and manipulative br br i have to give extra credits to claire danes she literally shines in this movie her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie br br overall the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interesting i was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards i have to give at least 9 10 stars for this
<START> i bought this from blockbuster for 99p the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh t but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video talking of home videos since when has it been fair game to release them as films i mean to say films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on not any more just gather your friends and lame o ideas together for the weekend lavish the production with an Â£8 00 budget and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard the soundtrack then slap it on the shelves for some poor sap me to take home in lonely desperation but here's the clincher i fast forwarded through most of this and tossed it to one side ready for the hammers until the next night while watching a darren day horror 'hellbreed' Â£1 99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster now this film made 'grim weekend' look like the exorcist so i slapped grim weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards that viewers claimed were hilarious sure enough once i had got over the misery the pain and the horror of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast i could enjoy savour and downright get down to the funny stuff and there's a lot of it check the boards then check the flick hell it might even be worth it awwwww crap
<START> emory is a cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union the mill which once employed 45 000 has seen its numbers dwindle to 5 000 recently and now 1 as the plant just shut its doors leaving a single security guard at first newly unemployed emory and his pals enjoy their independence hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar where they down depth charges with reckless abandon they think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep's optimistic spiel but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes emory's father a dedicated union man is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill meanwhile some of the unemployed men take demeaning make work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment br br finally the union admits its helplessness as emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again emory tearfully asks what did i do wrong as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job union church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn he hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of early in the morning they break into the mill fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives producing in one shift enough high quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall top to bottom something the plant manager thought was impossible br br arriving at the suddenly reopened plant the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day's work realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again the manager asks emory can you do this every day emory is forced to nod no and the manager asks then what were you trying to prove emory explains that the workers' decades of hard work honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day we just spit in your eye emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south promising to relocate the family when he finds it br br this is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of american workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short sightedness of concession demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them peter strauss as emory john goodman as his best friend gary cole as his college boy brother pamela reed as emory's sympathetic wife and john doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture
<START> this movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from april 10 2002 through april 14 2002 in the venezuelan presidential palace caracas venezuela br br the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez br br one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure hugo chavez's persona single handedly brought the venezuelan people to overthrow the 3 day old military installed junta and re establish the democratically installed government of venezuela br br it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat that the mainstream media aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising br br what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media br br it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986 to turn america into blind and rudderless state br br may hugo chavez open patriotic americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision
<START> elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order ada's and her acting is even worse here her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she can't remember where she left her keys br br this is an important true story so it's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message the rest of the cast is talented enough but they just can't overcome rohm's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required
<START> this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen i glowed inside throughout the whole film the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen the slow pace was set by the mode of travel a riding lawn mower with a big trailer and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow paced lives of the other characters br br the story actually happened alvin straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 there was no acting everything was completely real as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead always wanting to do the right thing richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother lyle who has had a stroke alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way br br the film underscores the importance of family to this man and hopefully to all of us i eagerly anticipate seeing it again and again directed by david lynch this films proves his directorial skill farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor at 79 he was the oldest nominee ever for that award
<START> i thought it was not the best re cap episode i've every seen though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the brendan fraser moment sigh it was nice to see cox outside of the incessantly brittle coxism state he is in these days if only for brief moments i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair or height in case of jd and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes i can also see how zach might be well on the way to a very chevy chase or is that matthew perry prat fall induced chemical slide already acknowledged on conan a little side note the song now stuck in my head from the janitor induced dance montage was diner by martin sexton
<START> this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didn't connect with the film and felt like stand alone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong she's stubborn and selfish black woman we've seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that hudson's character faces hardship because of her weight it is really her own refusal to do what's best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless hudson's academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writer director's fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character eddie murphy's character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what it's about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes it's a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in '06 and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with
<START> this movie was extremely depressing br br the characters were so cold the mother who is he main character is everything but motherly ok she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first her husband dies she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him until this part the movie is all right not excellent but it can be watched the guy is charming and who can blame her ok it's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's lover but let's blame that on the shock of losing her husband br br she becomes totally obsessed with the guy i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie she's always there wanting to please him in an old fashioned way with snacks while he is working on her son's house i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do as if it was the only way she could get his attention the guy obviously is not very interested actually it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity and instead of being insulted by that she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive i want to please you she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly br br what outraged me in this movie is the utter lack of self respect the mother has for herself she tells craig something like i am just a shapeless lump the first time they sleep together br br this movie is an insult to women kind if it had been me i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain
<START> i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long it brings out the child in everyone i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment louis sachar thats who although the movie was different from the book it was still very good for example caveman stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there weight wise and height wise but zigzag ricky was taller and armpit theodore was bigger also x ray rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion i especially like the work of the boys though like squid alan who was played by jake m smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid jake m smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun
<START> i happened upon this film by accident and really enjoyed timothy busfield's character is without redeeming qualities and at one point busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by meloni's take on the parade is different from busfield's janel maloney is terrific she looks very much like tea leone but the major difference here is that janel can actually act some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it's on cable
<START> after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller madam lili 1969 starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back it is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918 it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity
<START> a major moneymaker for rko radio bombardier stars pat o'brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots o'brien and scott argue over teaching methods while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley o'brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers stylistically bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films with moments of subtle poignancy the death of trainee eddie albert alternating with scenes of ludicrous yellow peril melodrama the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans though it can't help but seem dated today bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan who'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940 br br anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film please contact me at iamaseal2 yahoo com
<START> first off i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan but i did like this movie br br i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about i didn't find justin's acting that bad it was clearly the worst out of the group but it's a pretty impressive group with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist uncovering corrupt cops but i found it well done l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well and as much as i love kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character didn't have a whole lot of substance but it's kevin spacey he can do no wrong br br surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop truly believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of times br br i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible catchphrases unjustified action sequences stuff like that but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that every shooting had a point it wasn't clichÃ©d pretty solid really br br overall amazing cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen i would say it's worth seeing
<START> the memory of the the last hunt has stuck with me since i saw it in 1956 when i was 13 it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives the environment and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed it is as relevant today as in 1956 a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days
<START> this movie came to me highly recommended by matt groening well actually i watched both the simpsons and futurama and it gets a mention in both so i figured what the heck the film brings home a few what if's that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor nice that those responsible didn't over load the film with unnecessary special effects ray guns etc some nice looking 'furniture' once you figure out what that means remember tuesday is soylent green day
<START> it is incredible yes someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film it is don't do so i'm totally rankled i liked wesley snipes and i founded funny that he played his name's meaning in a movie anyway i wanted to see this film at home only of course but now just after i am absolutely disappointed it was his worst movie ever inwatchable bad actor play bad cameraman bad scenario only one good think that wonderful girl must be a manikin surely eeeeh mb 10 lines minimum i don't want to waste you're time anymore to read my opinion i hope i was clear and under stable because english is not my native method of speaking so have grate time and see good films like i try too peace
<START> as there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom it was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter you have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville i really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned this was by far one of the worst with in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on clark's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week may as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day
