<START> while the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name simply changed br br at the very least for a movie to hold some credibility try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment weapons and tactics nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm br br aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the south african defence force it serves little purpose definitely no entertainment value br br aspiring movie makers this is how not to make a war movie do some research and have some pride in your product
<START> i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero's every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe i've got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it
<START> this show has a few clichÃ©s and a few over the top dawson's creek like moments a 16 year old talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesn't turn out to be life altering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
<START> although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking and before digital triumphed over strike that you get the point this 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator the pace is slow but elegantly so because the cinematography is so beautiful record it the next time its on t v because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip off made for t v movie direct to video never felt so good
<START> i recently watched this again and there's another version which is shorter 1999 i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference br br one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice br br prof ivy was rather boring she sounded as if she was almost asleep no expression at all with the few lines she had br br this was enjoyable enough but there wasn't much to it at all br br a collector whos after lugia he has no plan to destroy the world and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction br br the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better deoxys poke 7 is great with no 8 almost here
<START> oh boy god bless the 1970's we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade the exorcist jaws the texas chainsaw massacre halloween and now raggedy ann andy a musical adventure this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world i mean seriously this movie scared the heck out of me my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money what the heck it's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of toy story pretty much down to a key only this was a thousand times scarier disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children br br whenever marcella leaves the room raggedy ann along with her brother raggedy andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life on marcella's birthday a new doll babette arrives from paris france to the united states of america babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll but the friendly raggedy ann does everything she can to make babette feel at home however the pirate captain contagious kidnaps her raggedy ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before marcella discovers babette is gone out in the world outside the nursery the two meet the camel with the wrinkled knees a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely after raggedy ann and andy hitch a ride on the camel he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking runs over the edge of a cliff into a deep pit in this pit they encounter the greedy who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full the raggedys and the camel narrowly escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find babetteÂ and believe me it just gets weirder from this point on br br while this movie was certainly disturbing and i just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie this was actually pretty creative back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it you can tell that they did that with raggedy ann andy a musical adventure this certainly wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen i just don't know who to recommend it too as scared as i was i have to admit i'm glad i watched it sometimes you need a wtf movie to spice up your selection believe me when i say that raggedy ann had no problem in doing just that with me it's official that doll is just plain creepy let's just put it this way there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs a bizarre thing that humiliates raggedy ann and her brother a strange almost incest between ann and andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs yikes br br 7 10
<START> i'm a don johnson fan but this is undoubtedly the worst movie done by anybody that i've ever seen the acting was bad as was the cinematography don should stick to doing action because as the king he just didn't cut it
<START> this movie is similar to the play entitled 'blithe spirit' written by noel coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to coward's writing i'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is br br sad these movies are so expensive to produce i do perk up when a screenplay is original i even perk up when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some samples mentioned such as topper etc br br i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment however i'm not please when the public's taste is taken for granted in this situation the public's taste is overlooked br br i look forward to better produced movie entertainment br br in this case i rather see the play
<START> i borrowed slightly modified title from some other comment i have to say that as i usually don't like relationship series i really did liked this one great characters interesting and not clichÃ© story good acting good and again not clichÃ© which in case of dialogs is rather rare dialogs it is really interesting how the characters cross paths with each other and sometimes knowingly sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives but unfortunately as we say in our country do you know how do you recognize a good us series it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season sure it isn't always true but
<START> as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel it is quite simply brilliant full marks to everyone from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers
<START> left behind is the kind of we know what we know cause we know it movie that christians and most any other naive person needs to help them feel like what they think and believe not know is right but at the same time i feel bad for the little guys because this is not a well made film it does not help any message i work at a video store and i know the only reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was anybody on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong unless they think they know that they don't know i've had about enough but only after i've had too much of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi talented tv actor means something above me br br please if you love yourself you'll stay away i refuse to go into any detail about this movie not because a i didn't see it because i did b it was too shocking for my atheist self to handle because it wasn't or c i really don't have anything to say bad about it because i do the reason which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands is that i want this movie out of my head i want that it was made out of my head i want that i watched all of it with an open mind out of my head i want the message that kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head i only want all the things that were in my head before viewing this movies there anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head get out my peaceful rage is ending i'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future but won't when they could have given that seven dollars plus to any number of human animal or rain forest charity but if they did that then they wouldn't be able to believe in the fact that it's real they might have to fact what is left behind zero out of
<START> aka mondays in the sun br br i have no idea what i just watched three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path this is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality br br i have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic i'm afraid i cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto humans who ever walked br br all in all this was not a movie it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience i've watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage there is nothing profound here whatsoever it's crap br br it rates a zero 10 from br br the fiend
<START> as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child br br this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the cubs are just too adorable i rewind that 'flying my colors' scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing it br br the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to i'm listening to 'our beginning' also known as 'recalling' at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie 'care a lot' br br i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising br br there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weird strange i think it is a wonderful movie br br basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any 'pokemon movie' with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality
<START> this is a very memorable spaghetti western it has a great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from rosalba neri her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when she's not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that there's anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too br br the music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are a couple of parts that are very amusing i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot there's also lots of slick gun play that's very well done br br i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill bud spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly mexican sidekick i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasn't at all funny all i can say is where is tuco when you need him br br all that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie
<START> what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore br br spoilers here br br top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just desserts br br end of spoiler br br as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour
<START> alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie br br the only difference is that their trip is somewhere between heaven and hell and ends up being both when they meet the grim reaper they get the chance of an after lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have besides playing roles they have er perfected they also play and revive a couple of extra sales in the process some classic games i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet br br the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with what it might be like instead of what was without spoiling the movie i can't give you anymore information about this i guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself 8 out of 10 stars
<START> saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival and it's a stick to your bones movie it's really stayed with me adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel it's a back and forth in time drama with fully rounded characters thoughtful rumination on life choices and i'm not exaggerating one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100 years of movie making wonderful work from everyone led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying deluded newport matron and claire danes as her much younger self meryl streep's daughter mamie gummer is like mama the real deal patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesn't overplay the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp detailed cameos hugh dancy also from the stage doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichÃ©d role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow but it's a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being recklessly manipulated also what a sumptuous parade of 1940s 50s automobiles
<START> i was surprised that ''the secret fury'' was an enjoyable good film probably because i didn't have any expectations for this movie though the film does have it's plot holes i would say that you couldn't guess who was behind the whole scheme until the very end of the movie at first i thought it was robert ryan using the same method like ''gaslight'' where husband tries to drive his wife mad but i was wrong the main problem with the movie is they drive at a whole other direction which gave no clues at the beginning i thought robert ryan claudette colbert carried their parts well plus vivian vance a fine character actress who steals scenes in this one those who like movies that keeps you guessing will like this one
<START> this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever it's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions with people hiding their identities and their natures the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality's and desires br br the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film when this happens the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely br br one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective we actually care when people are killed in this film this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain br br at the same time this is also a fun movie it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film there is bad dubbing the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the film br br and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is the lighting and composition are spectacular at times the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines he doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people br br this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level it's art it's trash it's emotionally moving and it's fun it has a true sense of morality but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not
<START> i remember this movie quite intense for an 11 year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard i'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood oh those 70's what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre pubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film and then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids
