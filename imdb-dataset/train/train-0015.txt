<START> who made this film i love this film somebody has a wacky sense of humor br br this zany surreal style of film making is appealing but it is hard to create or easy to forget that substance and characters who actually have souls are what give such a film depth without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas who cares it may get laughs but it goes through you like a half good hamburger next br br crosseyed may not intend to change anybody's life but i appreciate the depth and substance they sneak up on you i started this film thinking oh i get it indie comedy off the wall gonzo yup and it is that but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out in this sense the film breathes it makes propositions that give pause if you're available to see them and then of course it goes on its insanely merry way br br you will miss the point if you don't sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this movie br br crosseyed isn't perfect but smart people made it i want more br br the dining room scenes are an absolute hoot br br put on your seat belt
<START> i searched video store everywhere to find this movie being the huge elvis fan that i am and i found it to be a huge disappointment kurt russel had most of the elvis moves down and the voice imitation was great but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just didnt work for me the voice didnt always match up with russels mouth and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable also there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film people who dont know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life the time when he got his first guitar is wrong im pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave not one with a huge headstone reading jesse garron i know it was just a tv movie but they skipped over important events like the come back special and dragged some scenes out for way too long if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent thats the way it is or another elvis concert hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent brilliant statement i know but still go out and rent a good elvis flic
<START> ya know when one looks at this brian depalma film today i'm sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on vhs when i was 20 i thought it was ulta violent and gritty as well but i didn't get 'it' br br a few decades go by and man how i know how much i didn't get in this film this is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's 40's how can you improve upon a classic ya don't but you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80's depalma stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good film br br yes disco was dying and new wave punk were taking over but these immigrants from cuba who had to make a new home in florida couldn't tell the difference it was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it to these immigrants there was only one way to get it in florida where they were by having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empire br br al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana the little train that could what an amazing way to have your lead character look at america to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get the money the women and the power br br that's what tony saw as the american dream br br he wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it tony montana's command of the english language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect emily post's finishing school for him and his co horts look at how they came to america what they knew what they were exposed to this is the way tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in america it was all about the power tony montana would and did anything to achieve it it all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glory br br the part of the film that personified the 1980's to me is the money laundering tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank did those around tony and his crew care at the clubs where he spent and drank nope money was money and with money you get the power tony was living high off the hog he and his pretty blond american trophy he married played well by michelle pfieffer br br after tony montana's rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there he's riddled with doubt he's drug addicted he's paranoid he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take over his trophy 80's american blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire because he's going down and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again i ask what do you expect br br this is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the american dream to obsession it's violent bloody overly so but it drives the point disturbingly home not all cubans thrown out of cuba who landed in florida in the 80's were anything like tony montana give me a break but the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the usa to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in america br br makes you wonder has anything from then been learned today
<START> this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film double indemnity is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script this grade b tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black and white films and sought disclaimers on wide screen movies that are shown in pan and scan versions the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake br br the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script the billy wilder raymond chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time slot with room for commercials then update the production with bland color photography smart upscale sets and tv familiar actors thus the brand new double indemnity eliminates the atmospheric black and white film noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis br br the look of jack smight's take on double indemnity is more dynasty than film noir phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for and neff's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman's salary not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry 200 000 if not money then perhaps murder for love or lust not in this version richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff and his attempts at double entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind only lee j cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better work br br there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double disc package the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and tv grade production values the 1973 double indemnity should be titled 10 indemnity because viewing it only underscores the 100 perfection of the original movie
<START> i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together the talk is not of the master's great films like north by northwest or strangers on a train but a lesser known effort like this one from 1931 obscure and seriously flawed which showcases the great director in fledgling form br br emily and fred hill joan barry and harry kendall are a middle class london couple scrimping to stay ahead he begrudges their lot she accepts it change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury they make plans for a world cruise but their problems have only begun br br just ask richard hannay roger o thornhill or marion crane well marion's indisposed at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight setting one up for a perilous journey at best this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme and not his most successful or memorable hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element in this case domestic drama rather than suspense but the two do not cohere at least not here br br the hills are a dull flat couple with no chemistry or personality when they find themselves at the folies bergÃ¨re in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers the curtain's gone up too soon gasps emily they aren't dressed br br when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing even if the people they partner off with are drips too emily's man gordon percy marmont carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs which he suggests be filled by emily fred's girl the princess betty amann has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five o'clock shadow there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue subtlety was still to come br br everything is shot in an abrupt manner with confusing blocking and strained dialogue hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears when fred and emily break off they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged together rickshaws one of many clunky attempts at symbolism br br emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion br br matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with and presumably repair their relationship only they aren't active participants in the resolution and except for the fate of a friendly cat nothing about the ending resonates br br at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food rich and strange is hitchcock paying his dues and learning his trade one for scholars but not casual film goers
<START> critically people say that antz is better antz is a good film but i enjoyed bug's life a bit more i can't remember a pixar animation other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the animation is clean the story is original and doesn't preach the voice overs are what make this movie dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey as is haydn panettiere as dot there is also sterling support from dennis leary david hyde pierce and madeline kahn and i could go on and on the script is fantastic so funny and sometimes even touching it lacks the social messages of antz but what we have is rock solid entertainment 9 10 bethany cox
<START> i don't think you can get much worse then this put together bad actors fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get this b rate pointless excuse for a movie br br the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit plus the man is ok but the woman is rather ugly you look great not the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three i'd say but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie br br the more stories you go through the worse it gets there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous the whole i want to be a werewolf too how could you do this to me was silly to say you asked for it now get over it the werewolf will not even be spoken of its a rat br br the third one has no point almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting boring br br music yes bad who couldn't even hear some parts it was stupid animals effects were either rat or pig like which was stupid they couldn't use lion sounds guess not good movies use that well i f you enjoy b rates this is good for you i got this movie since i'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i'll buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once but thats just me if you prefer good ones don't waste your money i beg you
<START> i gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god the enging the thing is i don't want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie but i will recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it don't forget popcorn
<START> marvelous james stewart vera miles vehicle what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film br br the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency it deals with airplane bomb plots killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain fighting organized crime nazis and communists in that order the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles they raise 3 children as miles' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment br br look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton years later he appeared as mr robinson in 1967's the graduate br br the film has nothing but praise for j edgar hoover he certainly brought the fbi up to par br br true this could be viewed as right wing propaganda especially with stewart's real life republican views but it's well done historically informative and the view of the family so well depicted
<START> marie you are smooth dan no i'm not smooth i'm dan br br if you're anything like me smooth and single do not go together you see someone you like rare enough as that can be and you want to say something but you don't or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life more often then not though you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life Â a risk you can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career there are reasons some valid some not and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason you tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening any way you break it down it's not easy sound familiar if you thought yes even just a little then dan in real life the new comedy from director peter hedges is a must see it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once br br the dan from the title is dan burns steve carell an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced fulfilling and morally uplifting life four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day he lost his wife and love of his life after that tragedy dan was left to raise their three daughters alone between that and focusing on his career finding love again was not one of dan's priorities and so he became more functional than feeling removed from the power of intimacy dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again that is until he meets marie juliette binoche in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning they're interaction is casual comfortable and it catches both of them off guard there is only one problem really she is already seeing someone unfortunately for all involved that someone is dan's brother mitch dane cook his entire family has come up to their parents' country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan's heart from its coma br br with so many family members to deal with jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film luckily hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes despite the occasional evan almighty sized misstep he is charismatic charming and obviously a sharp humorist as dan he is also self deprecating awkward and scared carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona perhaps more importantly he is entirely relatable as dan whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen unable to stan d still in his anxiety dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time br br i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did despite its slight shortcomings juliette binoche Â i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved because of where i am in my life would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film i can't say what i can say as someone who knows what it means to be lonely dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen
<START> i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely having unfortunately dealt with lucas at such a young age howard is now caught up in so many of lucas' traits how else do you explain his rampage of disasters his only useful film of course has been 'willow' everything else including this is too reliant on superficial junk br br some spoilers br br he can't even have semi intelligent focus like peter weir no poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten br br here we have the old adage love conquers all even disease too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill heck even disney did better than this ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities br br howard's commentary track is just awful don't even rent the dvd br br final analysis cinematic dud
<START> although nothing can compare to vampires vs zombies in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie br br firstly the special effects were breath taking when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me simply stunning my friends br br but the scene when the jack black sound a like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on i must be high seriously he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers sponsors you will probably get the same response seriously br br with a production team called shock o rama i was shocked i didn't place a sawed off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played br br if you want to see this movie then you should be murdered br br yours truly br br the general
<START> i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double negatives are required here it's that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again br br the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as jacob marley dressed in a silly powder white costume guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo scrooge finney's scrooge is so hideous a person it's impossible to believe his transformation br br steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs
<START> the words swedish and action movie do not mix that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre this is yet another failed attempt br br lasse brunell shanti roney works at a military air base with top secret computer systems one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it br br this movie has it's ups and downs and usually in swedish action movies there are no ups just downs so i guess something in this movie showed some quality to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice the acting is of very varying quality shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank stefan sauk is laughable as the cool special forces man who comes to the base to investigate br br and what about the action scenes well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice but aside from that there is not much action to talk about and that is a common problem with swedish action films there is just not enough action going on maybe it's a budget problem maybe it's film making culture i don't know but it negatively affects the experience because quite frankly the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that br br i rate this 4 10 for effort
<START> the main problem of the first vampires movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene why didn't carpenter use more of this this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence for example inside a city and was left somewhat disappointed while los muertos proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor it still drags a little in some parts though nowhere near as bad as vampires did much like vampires however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense br br most of the above may sound like los muertos is a bad movie but it definitely isn't it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake like almost every other vampire movie out there nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii it simply could have used a bit more excitement br br i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen br br spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable una should have gotten away that would have made the movie quite unusual
<START> i've only watched the first series on dvd but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script the series is as good as goodfellas and casino and almost as good as the godfather hence not a 10 and far better than any of guy ritchie's efforts although there's plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e g the priest's relationship or lack of with carmilla and the restaurateur's wife and christopher and his dimwit friend who didn't last very long a darwin award nominee br br apart from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons i liked it br br 1 it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce 2 the music 3 it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
<START> i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike long live kermit miss piggy and the rest of the gang
<START> i come to pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here i'm relatively new to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us so i don't have a broad basis for comparing pinjar to other indian films luckily no comparison is needed br br pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece br br in one line i can tell you that pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time on a mass appeal scale it could have been the indian equivalent of crouching tiger hidden dragon had it been adequately promoted in the us this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map the american movie going public has a long standing love affair with gone with the wind and while pinjar doesn't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities not the least of which is the whopping by us standards 183 minute run time br br set against the gritty backdrop of the india pakistan partition in 1947 48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating put into an untenable position she somehow manages to not only survive but to grow and even flourish br br if the story is lacking in any way it's in the exposition puro's the protagonist growth as a person would be better illustrated at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture if her character's back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film but that would have stretched a 3 hour movie to 3 1 2 hours or perhaps even more because not one minute of the film is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains br br i could use many words to describe pinjar poignant disturbing compelling heart wrenching come to mind immediately but uplifting is perhaps as apropos as any of those any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such and puro's triumph while possibly not immediately evident to those around her is no less than inspirational for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enough br br equally inspiring is urmila matondkar's portrayal of puro all too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger newer actresses urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays she doesn't merely act puro's part she breathes life into the character manoj bajpai's selection as rashid was inspired he manages something far too few indian film heroes can subtlety his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword wielding rioters combined br br if you only see one bollywood film in your life make it pinjar
<START> this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies but you'd think that even the homeless and urban dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor ice t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before br br and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle br br i'm assuming this movie was based on richard connell's short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story i reedited the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being 43 minutes long
<START> the film cross eyed by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive settings costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next you can't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can't wait for his sophomore effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo
