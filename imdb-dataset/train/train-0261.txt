<START> carol the young girl at the center of the story is transplanted to a foreign land spain at the height of the civil war conflict in the late 30s for this girl everything is new in it's foreignness the war and her father are her constant worries while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in new york br br imanol uribe directs this film by the numbers carol's family is obviously divided while carol's mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction the rest of the family's sympathies are with the franco and the fascists that won the conflict br br the story adds nothing to what has already been told much better but it's an easy film to watch northern spain's magnificent landscape is shown don't expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around carol and the young boys she befriends br br clara lago plays carol with sincerity and innocence maria barranco is carol's mother aurora the one that went away to america rosa maria sarda is maruja the teacher who befriends carol carmelo gomez plays alfonso the man that aurora left behind when she left for america this actor who usually has lead roles in most spanish films doesn't have anything to do as he remains an enigma throughout the movie
<START> half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in finland these stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard this indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time br br the film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key the film improves so stick with it two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving br br while the various scenes of family life take place in finland the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live br br collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90 minute drama
<START> a couple of days after writing about how garbage like mad cows and this filthy earth receive money while ange duncan and theo are totally ignored i had to sit through yet another british movie that had me scratching my head as to why it received a single penny some people may claim that because dead babies is based upon a highly regarded novel it has an in built market but both this filthy earth and mad cows were also adapted from novels and they were an ordeal to sit through as well br br i had read the synopsis of the plot where a bunch of high class wasters go to a remote mansion where they're stalked by an internet cult but to be honest this isn't really how the story unravels and anyone expecting friday the 13th meets the shining is going to be bitterly disappointed since 90 95 of the running time is taken up with said characters taking drugs and discussing sex and what hateful characters they are too not one of them is likable in any way and within minutes you'll be getting nostalgic for stalin mao and pol pot hoping that next time someone embarks on communist democide they'll be successful in creating an egalitarian utopia anything that will signal the end of such decadent bourgeois meaningless that the hateful characters in this movie embark upon can only be welcomed br br not content with giving us a movie where the plot is meandering and where the audience fail to connect with the characters the director continues to spoil things further by getting all clever and arty no doubt that is to impress us so we will fall upon our knees and cry oh my god what a wonderful director the way he bamboozles us with his highly artistic technique and only a worthless pleb will fail to appreciate what a god given talent this man is i'm sure the vast majority of people either screamed how come my projects got turned down while crap like this didn't or wtf was the last half hour of this piece of crap all about you might defend the movie by saying the original source novel was unfilmable and this makes the film unwatchable i will agree that this movie is unwatchable br br i know the imdb classes this as an american movie but the style and faults with dead babies is uniquely british americans might think they've got things tough with bush but we've got tony blair not to mention dead babies mad cows and this filthy earth no wonder everyone is ashamed to be british in the 21st century
<START> another very good mann flick thanks to the father son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river rio bravo he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend you're wrong mr dunston jeff webster stewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for it br br the caption above plays on tatum's assertion that he can't live without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screen br br i recommend this film and now own the dvd
<START> i also saw this upon its release in '56 and have been struck since then with its final scene if this is an answer to 'high noon ' then it's an apt and apposite response the notion that as this string is headed the town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of 'high noon ' in this theme 'concho' is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorites 'the magnificent seven ' both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially sinatra's transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i've inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves
<START> this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy was he wrong this movie has a great family appeal with no sex scenes like other movies jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam's shoes the supporting cast is great as well br br science coming of age family quarrels a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good although the score is presented quite choppily the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness br br the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal replay value is great i've seen it quite a few times already
<START> the first part che in cuba is about that portion of his life it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded remember that che was a physician it ends as castro wins the revolution che never gets to havana the second part che in bolivia is about guess what it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded br br when i realized this was supposed to be an epic i never knew anything but the title before it started i naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all david lean's lawrence of arabia more of that later br br not to be a racist but aside from what i've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable unknown hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear che beards and all wear che fatigues this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che benicio del toro even fidel has a very minor role while del toro's terrific think of lawrence with peter o'toole as the only discernible character no alec guinness no omar sharif no anthony quinn etc you get the idea br br because the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference when top aides of che are killed you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are even when che is killed i don't think that's a spoiler there's no empathy from the audience he's just killed br br he's too one dimensional to relate to as a human being aside from being a revolutionary and second only to jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about che is that he's married with five children he tells another character that near the end what was his motivation a complete enigma br br maybe soderbergh is purposely aping lean like soderbergh's che lean never lets us know anything about lawrence the mystery man of arabia but at least lawrence had a friend sharif and associates guinness quinn he was as courageous as he was insecure i e had human qualities che is like a machine about as warm as the terminator br br earlier this year there was another war epic mongol che makes mongol look like it's a wonderful life
<START> i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied to night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen br br there was nothing happening in this film what so ever i didn't care for any of the characters didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot didn't care how it ended nothing br br there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers there's nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog barking outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn br br i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down what's more disappointing is that i'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didn't work for me br br i might even have given it 1 10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
<START> when i noticed that hamish macbeth was being broadcast in the united states i was thrilled i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing i adore m c beaton's books about the wonderful scottish constable the characters in the book are entertaining and very well written the powers that be who are responsible for this mish mash apparently have never have read one of beaton's books only the name hamish macbeth has anything to do with the series besides the lack of familiar characters i find the whole show offensively loud it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other if you love m c beaton's adorable hamish macbeth don't waste your time on this rubbish
<START> watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the non action and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo croat indie and find them fascinating br br the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over orchestrated one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters 'collide' in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didn't this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems two dimensional br br the worse for this is the character of bill spear aka snoop dogg i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character's aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early noughties if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandable br br the lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazz infused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too well lit br br the tenants to me is an unbelievable film it doesn't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or black br br strangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable
<START> diagnosis murder has been shown on most weekday afternoons on bbc1 since i used to watch it while ill from school a good 10 years ago i know i shouldn't really enjoy it in the same way i shouldn't enjoy 'murder she wrote' but i'm totally addicted to both and even have the dvd box sets ok i know that's sad br br dick van dyke carries the show as he stars as dr mark sloan a doctor at community general hospital in l a who is also a police consultant for the l a p d his son steve barry van dyke dick's real life son is a police officer who needs his father's help on very many suspicious deaths br br along for the ride is dr amanda bentley victoria bentley the resident pathologist at community general and for the first couple of seasons you had scott baio playing dr jack stewart who upped and left the series in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things he should have stayed where he was he hasn't done anything of note since and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in baby geniuses 2 superbabies oh dear br br anyhow dr jack stewart was replaced by the younger dr jesse travis played by charlie schlatter who stepped into baio's shoes pretty comfortably br br the series is highly implausible but what whodunit series isn't murder she wrote everywhere jessica goes someone ends up dead or the underrated father dowling mysteries about a murder solving priest with nun sidekick br br the series was much lighter up until 1997 this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling hospital manager norman briggs played by michael tucci along with nurse mark's secretary dolores played by delores hall after 1997 both these characters were no longer included and the series became a grittier affair with a bigger looking budget some episodes included far more action one episode the entire hospital is blown up br br this was a family show for the van dyke's because as well as dick's son barry you also had dick's daughter and all his grandchildren making an appearance in various episodes br br as the series went on it got a bit silly one episode i remember dick van dike plays his entire family which was a bit out of the ordinary but on the whole 'diagnosis murder' was a really good tv show which had numerous good guest stars br br since this show finished in 2001 dick barry have appeared together again in the 'murder 101' series of tv movies made by the hallmark channel pretty much following the same path and still enjoyable dick who's now in his mid 80's doesn't seem to change a great deal and looks as if he'll be working till the bitter end br br tv show out of
<START> the year 1934 was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself unfortunately the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here two of those things were singing and dancing another was a short interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off the depression you know the other keys to shirley's successful films br br this film achieved none of the above despite the star presences of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry hathaway in addition there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring and too many arguments between a sullen lombard and cooper to top it off you didn't get the normal feel good ending which is what the public wants i guess they learned after this movie
<START> with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong but what can i say this was a horrible misfire the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it br br that song about Âarabella cinderella' is pretty cool but that is it i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there br br peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from dr strangelove and being there throughout his career to dumb movies like this and the magic christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few funny moments this one is senseless and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie not recommended for anyone
<START> i am a huge willem dafoe fan and really sought out this film i had to get a region 5 chinese dvd of it but it is truly one of the worst that i've seen in quite a while br br the acting except for dafoe is horrible dafoe and colagrande both wrote and directed this though he isn't credited as a director and they have no discernible talents for writing or directing stick to acting willem giada get out of the business please br br absolutely nothing happens except a series of completely unconvincing totally without believable motivation acts by these two people that just met in this house colagrande's sleepy i couldn't care less expression practically never changes and the sex scenes are downright lame i actually cringed twice at one of them yuck they're definitely not the least bit erotic and yet are the only time the film isn't putting you to sleep then it's busy repulsing you br br just awful
<START> this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated it's pure delight and fun gratuitous servings of blood insanity and black humor which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot only for the connoisseurs
<START> i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes the love of the dead or something similar this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 2 and der todesking the death king the nekromantik movies are ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia even if they obviously are horror opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funny br br todesking on the other hand is in my opinion one of the best films ever made it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death death as an enemy death as a reliever death as the very fysical decomposition of the body the film is a metaphor over life it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are it reduces its viewers to the childs they we actually are the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death and hence neither the process of dying is the core message of the film this is a most realistic film never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever no matter what moral standards you set up death is unevitable and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality this applies to you dear reader like it applies to the viewers of the film some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this which is fully excused since they of course will live forever br br this is no exploitation movie why because death does not exploit us humans it harvests us we grow for seven days then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre birth that is death buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales whether you choose to regard it as optimistic or pessimistic is up to you at first glance it may seem very dark consider though that in order for something to live something else must die who wants to live forever br br i believe that when buttgereit shows a body that are being consumed by maggots he shows not only decomposition but generation of new life is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre br br when you realize this you see der todesking it its right context br br sieben tage hat die woche siebenmal letzte stunden seven are the days of week weak mortal seven times the last hour br br dont fear the reaper buttgereit tells us because the reaper takes only what is ripe and apples that are not plucked for food will rot br br have a good life fellow imdb'ers br br and watch this film that compares only to ingemar bergmans the seventh seal in terms of depth and universality
<START> a real classic ten out of ten every actor is perfect the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking wonder if this film is already out in dvd because it must be seen in widescreen version saw this film in the late fifties maybe three or four times and never since then forgot it i remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performances the only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like say nicholas ray to increase its rhythm and tension
<START> first off i'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing one comment that bad sf movies become good comedies is right on the mark mst3000 made it's living off that br br if you look at the angry red planet as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959 you'll have the handle on this sucker all the elements are there the pseudoscience occasionally logical more often hilariously infantile the adolescent boy attitude toward sex with the gigolo captain good call on that one guys making eyes at the buxom scientist with hair so red it's a wonder it doesn't set off the fire alarms the ridiculous conception of mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red yet one alien monster has a mouse face and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kid's toy the comic relief an overweight astronaut who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun and of course the mere fact that alien dangerously evil if these people had met e t they would have roasted him in two seconds flat ow indeed br br don't get me wrong i rated this movie low still it's never boring except when the scientist tries to explain everything only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous and you have to admit in your little kid core it makes you jump a few times br br okay then don't admit it i guess you were never 10
<START> spoilers in as far as i describe characters and their relation to the plot br br this is a quality film the subject matter is at once grim and gripping the dogged determination of stephen rea's character burakov is simply captivating with any due apologies to him his hangdog continually put upon expression serves the character well he is as we in england would say of the inspector taggart tv series character bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week well that's not strictly accurate as chikatila operated over a number of years br br you get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the ussr bureaucracy brilliantly portrayed by joss ackland who often seems made for this sort of role br br a key character and i write this as the remake of invasion of the body snatchers is being shown on bbc1 is the donald sutherland character mikhail fetisov his quiet support of burakov is steadfast and it endures through perestroika and drives the involvement of the fbi for profiling brilliant br br this is a must see as far as i am concerned
<START> for loyal duran duran fans who want to watch a good music video skip this one the producers decided to get creative and make this 80's video something of a sci fi story involving the evil barbarella villain from which the band got its name br br what makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80's duran duran songs confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted but we have to suffer through some cheap spin off story hosted by an evil dr mario it's almost too much to bear 2 10
