<START> eric clapton jack bruce and ginger baker re unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called cream those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it all skinny very long hair wild clothes and loud music they played a combination of rock and blues and it was for the most part good stuff br br well these guys are now 60 something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us i was always extremely familiar with clapton of course who has never been out of the limelight but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades they surprised me when he was young baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death now he looks healthy in shape and his drum playing was solid bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing br br some people criticized this show for being low key i don't agree with that i have no complaints the concert sounded very good the second song spoonful was outstanding the highlight of the concert for me br br highly recommended
<START> this film is really bad it maybe harsh but it is it really is poor script every vampire clichÃ© in the book is used and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character i e ole dracula there have been some truly brilliant dracula vampire movies in the past but this doesn't even make it into the dire slot br br take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen slasher move add a dribble of dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious surreal day dreaming and you get a confusing mess of a film dracula 2000 br br i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent whats the problem with that i hear you cry well he is english but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent br br all in all you may as well say your money if you were thinking of buying it or rent it out watch it and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the tellytubbies br br p s although la la is pretty frightening
<START> when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of semana santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them off br br like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes br br mira sorvino hot in mighty aphrodite and other top rated films seems to have undersold herself to this project her acting is non existent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the film's various victims br br but let me warn you do not be the next victim step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf tbere are not many good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badly done dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production
<START> this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooney's group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hanks's character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies br br tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me
<START> this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is dÃ©ja vÃ¹ stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course it's night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow that's really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent cassel do what they can that's definitely not worth it 3 out of 10
<START> it just seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought this is funny i mean it's so hilarious it just has to be made who was this person is he or she the person really responsible for this are they the one's who owe me for my time more so than the director writer br br this film stinks in most every way possible there's no one shred of good dialogue and not one likable character and the story br br i prefer the 2nd worst movie ever hulk hogan's no hold's barred to this by quite a considerable degree it seems almost shakespearen in comparison br br the ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes and it's still under 80 minutes the outtakes include cast members laughing at the 'hilarious' mistakes they've made and things that went wrong on the set of this 'comedy ' glad to see someone laughing in someway with some connection to this 'film ' br br nothing in this film is funny nothing it just goes on and on it's truly that lame i love films that are so bad they're good this is so bad it's something but i don't know what and hopefully will never find out br br amanda peet doesn't suck outright and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film but that really means little br br avoid at all costs
<START> i was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the arabian nights instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning even though i tried watching it twice br br it was a bonus that caradine was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked likability for something a little similar zorro with anthony hopkins and bandaras is much better for action comic moments and overall enjoyability br br ok so son of the dragon has many possible fans out there but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it if you just want the kids to settle down on a sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas
<START> tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer like any other horror fan i loved the texas chainsaw but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title you should have at least more than one hit movie i can't really think of any other movie hooper has done on his own don't count poltergeist that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world and this movie night terrors just backs up my point br br poor robert englund i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given he did what he could as for the movie itself pure drudge unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes a story that must have been penned in an our and really just awful scenery music and cinematography nothing in this film is redeemable don't waste your time br br overall 1 out of 10 i feel sorry for hooper his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started i hope that he's able to pump out at least one more good flick that way he can do his cult status some justice br br
<START> i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series heidi barbapapa il etait une fois l'homme most of which i love i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match mazinger z as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern br br that very thing the novelty may be one of the best features of mazinger z another good point is its inventiveness with so many extravagant monsters strange devices and bizarre characters actually we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us
<START> there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed br br things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays the dialouge is often laden heavy handed and unconvincing one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war why must we murder one another why this mirrors the criticism near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti war message is painfully overstated it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later br br that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable and to be fair wells does ask the question the universe or nothing what shall it be in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive
<START> i always feel strange and guilty saying it because i'm a fairly well educated non teenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though i've never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional mary kate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a b storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they're not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointed br br that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us who've watched them since the first episodes of full house it's really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 downing street from winning london and the visit to the louvre from passport to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family br br as long as i still feel like i'm on my soapbox and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you don't have to be some pre teen valley girl from california in fact that's not really the target audience if it were the mk a fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that not wal mart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globe trotting and two girls from a valley in cali isn't really about that it's more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it that's called marketing you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least they're sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br basically don't knock the film until you've seen it and then don't knock it until you've tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids enjoy parents do the same if you like the olsen twins you won't be disappointed
<START> people love the original story for its ending the hollywood style ending made this 99 version of 'a dog of flanders' just for kids movie i didn't cry this time because the story was too hollywood japanese tv series are much better
<START> honestly i can't understand why this movie rates so well here nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest film i'm a huge fan of bakshi's earlier work particularly 'heavy traffic' and 'wizards' but frankly 'wizards' 1977 was the last good film he made after that he turned to the mainstream beginning with the diabolical 'lord of the rings' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight frank frazetta for 'fire and ice' br br what can i say the story is puerile the animation is tv quality i insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff and whereas 'wizards' had real imagination quirkiness some gorgeous background art and an underground adult sensibility 'fire and ice' is just designed for 14 year old boys and has the intellectual clout of robinson crusoe on mars br br yes if you liked the gor books you might like this in my view though this was just another blip in the slide in quality after 'wizards' from which bakshi never recovered though he's done some decent tv stuff fairly recently br br 4 5 out of 10
<START> new york i love you is full of love and power not for everybody however but is a beautiful movie br br it has the likes of shia labeouf seen in transformers disturbia charlies angels i robot indiana jones and many more maggie q kevin bacon blake lively natalie portman and many more with a star studded cast this movie is without a doubt brilliant br br from many top notch directors around the world it does not fail to impress the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique br br it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie and should be watched on a big tv this time trust the imdb rating because it is an excellent film br br eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010 br br watch ny ily you won't be disappointed
<START> who is bettie page i certainly didn't find out while watching this movie from what i have gathered from other sources ms page was highly in demand in the post world war ii period as the queen of naughty pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts i never did get to know bettie the woman though her childhood in tennessee was a combination of an evangelical christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at the film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film the naughty pictures characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of bettie in her pointy bras bettie in her girdle and stockings bettie in bondage etc the movie slides from black and white to color every time ms page visits miami beach then back to her shades of gray life in new york we go gretchen mol portrays bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet when bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her high school valedictorian by getting an a rather than an a one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class the most interesting part of this movie is how quaint ms page's naughty photos seem in 2007 it is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldn't even get a hit on my space or you tube i'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds i would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments
<START> bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress on the other hand starting in the 1980s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake edwards' 10 that is if she hadn't allowed her husband john derek to take over her career numerous playboy spreads and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold john figured that putting bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of burrough's lord of the jungle a slap in the face to character's book and film legacy tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for bo's breasts and richard harris' wonderful over acting remember the pair had worked together in orca his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance bo's body can only get you so far miles o'keeffe who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs but bo and john derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place br br and how did the orangutan get to africa
<START> i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas having reserved a special slot for it last night i sat down to watch it with my daughter aged 17 and a film studies student with chocolates of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin br br after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk the shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied despondent we viewed on br br anne played by sally hawkins looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions breaking our hard won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'i'll find you' stalking fashion br br poor rupert penry jones who played captain wentworth did his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall drenching him and his co actor they were nearly swept out to sea health and safety would have had a field day poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place br br other than mr penry jones alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head's unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott br br towards the long awaited end of the film captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being in contrast anne ran hyper ventilating from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up a sweat br br we experienced none of anne's charms crossing the screen indeed we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain spineless opinion less anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean winging sir walter to just shut the heck up br br the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment was painfully drawn out as they moved in closer anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met eww br br the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been br br what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of england's finest scenery br br sorry jane
<START> gentleman jim is another case of print the legend with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn's the charge of the light brigade this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh's vivid direction flynn is still at the height of his powers you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure this time as flynn's father jack carson takes sidekick duties this time indeed even the pirate galleon from flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out of place cameo in a dockside bout the 103 minutes just breeze by
<START> one thing i can say about this movie is well long very long i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's even though i never lived in them is actually one of my favourite decades especially for the music when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive i will admitt the animation did impress me it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see but the movie honestly could of been a bit better it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly in my opinion i thought it was extremely long i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie it made it seem like it was 4 hours long but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those nothing to do days i will see the new one and i hope it is better
<START> the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the end br br the seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10 10 if the others were up to par with this one this would get 10 10 br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part br br never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental
