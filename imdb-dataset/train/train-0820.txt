<START> now that che 2008 has finished its relatively short australian cinema run extremely limited release 1 screen in sydney after 6wks i can guiltlessly join both hosts of at the movies in taking steven soderbergh to task br br it's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style subject but soderbergh's most recent stinker the girlfriend experience 2009 was also missing a story so narrative and editing seem to suddenly be soderbergh's main challenge strange after 20 odd years in the business he was probably never much good at narrative just hid it well inside edgy projects br br none of this excuses him this present almost diabolical failure as david stratton warns two parts of che don't even make a whole br br epic biopic in name only che 2008 barely qualifies as a feature film it certainly has no legs inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history soderbergh's 4 5hrs long dirge just goes nowhere br br even margaret pomeranz the more forgiving of australia's at the movies duo noted about soderbergh's repetitious waste of hd digital storage you're in the woods you're in the woods you're in the woods i too am surprised soderbergh didn't give us another 2 5hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts because he still left out massive chunks of che's revolutionary life br br for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure soderbergh unaccountably alienates if not deliberately insults his audiences by br br 1 never providing most of che's story br br 2 imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition br br 3 ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events br br 4 barely developing an idea or a character br br 5 remaining claustrophobically episodic br br 6 ignoring proper context for scenes whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts br br 7 linguistically dislocating all audiences even spanish speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english and br br 8 pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension why at this late stage the t shirt franchise has been a success br br our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevara's memoirs so like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment soderbergh's product is exceedingly limited in perspective br br the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge scenery and circumstances of the revolutionaries but that doesn't elicit our sympathy instead it dawns on us that ah soderbergh's trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us equally mentally captive such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose br br part2 is more chronological than part1 but it's literally mind numbing with its repetitive bush bashing misery of outlook and lack of variety or character arcs deltoro's che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill disciplined troops the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant revolutionaries some of whom violently lack self control around local peasants or food we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency such as it was br br part2's excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again nothing is telegraphed or contextualized thus even the scenes with fidel castro demiÃ¡n bichir are unexpected and disconcerting any selected events are portrayed minimally and latino centrically with part1's interviews replaced by time shifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president joaquim de almeida and us government officials promising cia intervention br br the rest of part2's woods and day for night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they're eyeing the exits br br perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many non american latinos about never getting a truthful unspun history of che's exploits within their own countries when foreign governments still won't deliver a free press to their people for whatever reason then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the not so well read i may not be able to read or write but i'm not illiterate cf the inspector general 1949 out to their own local cinemas the film's obvious neglects and gross over simplifications hint very strongly that it's aiming only at the comprehensions of the less informed who still speak little english if they did they'd have read tomes on the subject already and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves learning the lessons of history as they should br br such insights are precisely what societies still need and not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south america yet it's what che 2008 gleefully fails to deliver soderbergh buries his lead because he's weak on narrative i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this it's been 44yrs hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted it's what i went to see this film for but the director diabolically robs us of that br br david stratton writing in the australian 03 oct 2009 observed that while part1 was uneven part2 actually goes rapidly downhill from there charting che's final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail which feels almost unbearably slow and turgid br br che the guerilla aka part2 is certainly no travelogue for bolivia painting it a picture of misery and atavism the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour and the dramatic yet tragic capture and execution of the film's subject br br the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing irritating misery shockingly for a soderbergh film to be avoided at all costs it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject 2 10
<START> not so many people like the movies of bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them simply because they are different kinds of people br br if you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here br br and also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black comedy or cult etc like those of pulp fiction etc because there is this delicacy which the audience of north america frequently fail to appreciate br br when i looked at these two hooligans' dining with jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant i felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been br br the urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the carrefour br br so les valseuses is much better a name than going places to dance a valse you need to be elegant but going places you don't
<START> a fantastic arabian adventure a former king ahmad and his best friend the thief abu played by sabu of black narcissus search for ahmad's love interest who has been stolen by the new king jaffar conrad veidt there's hardly a down moment here it's always inventing new adventures for the heroes personally i found ahmad and his princess a little boring there's no need to ask why john justin who plays ahmad is listed fourth in the credits conrad veidt always a fun actor makes a great villain and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who at one point finds a genie in a bottle i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra the father of the princess he collects amazing toys from around the world jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time willis o'brien's stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider 8 10
<START> after watching khakee i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly the film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce aryeman afterall his father keshu is the producer br br rks spoke so highly about the film during promotions saying the film has meat unlike films released that time i wonder which films was he talking about br br the film is actually a typical masala film with loads of comedy romance action everything jumbled br br the ease at which the kids kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever imagine kids kidnapping dawood's family br br the end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization br br rks gives his weakest film till date except some bachchan scenes the film is a bore br br music is boring br br amitabh tries to give the role his all he does his part well though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar his dubbing too isn't matched properly at times br br akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams br br aryeman seems expressionless tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes br br bhumika emerges the best of the lot br br the rest are okay
<START> hot millions is a well written well acted tale about an embezzler who steals whoops too low class a word for an embezzler according to peter ustinov's lead character a hot million from the london branch of a u s corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firm's ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them remember spoiler police this is a comedy not a mystery br br from 1968 this movie's depiction of computers may seem naive to today's more computer literate populace but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released i would assert that even then this smacks of having been written by and for computer illiterates probably on purpose to heighten the droll comedic aspects of this british flick br br if one has little taste for this type of entertainment the movie may seem to drag in spots fortunately it has a nicely wrapped up ending unfortunately the end credits give no indication of the classical music used therein the symphonic piece at the end and the piano flute duet in the middle just the song sung by lulu which i totally don't remember
<START> gene kelly frank sinatra kathryn grayson and jose iturbi star in anchors aweigh directed by george sidney br br kelly and sinatra are joe and clarence two navy guys on leave in hollywood they meet a little boy dean stockwell and on taking him home they meet his aunt grayson clarence falls for her she wants an audition for jose iturbi they try to help but there's a mix up br br this is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by kelly and sinatra kelly gets to dance with jerry the mouse in a delightful sequence grayson sings jalousie and my heart sings not one of my favorite voices but she does well iturbi's piano work is beautiful br br sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him with those big blue eyes and boyish face for kelly this was a major break for him at mgm br br wonderful movie very buoyant
<START> a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege ooh does that whet your appetite well then belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history for good measure it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog most of acting is amateurish the production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market jasmine guy ben vereen pam grier eartha kitt including some faces that have barely been seen at all bianca lawson rachel cuttrell it also is despite itself a sterling showcase for nicole lyn the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on hand as well so is the late ossie davis a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company this film should be rated t for tripe
<START> this movie is not based on the bible it completely leaves christ out of the movie they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ let alone talk about it it does not quote from scriptures the end times are called the great tribulation the movie does not even show bad times the seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure the anti christ was killed 3 1 2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended the only part they got correct was there was two prophets the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i wanted to take unsaved people to it i feel that the movie is evil it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books br br the second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development i have seen better episodes of miami vice
<START> val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his well endowments a drug addict and a guy who despite contracting aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing character br br the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in los angelos to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was acquitted just like in the case of o j the guilt factor regardless of the outcome ranged quite high in the he did it zone br br there is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a self serving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here
<START> this film could have been a silent movie it certainly has the feel of one i was extremely extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film extase is a 'symphony of love' and transcends all language versions french which is the ultimate romantic language seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version a young hedy lamarr lights up the screen in this film which in a way is almost like a sex fantasy but definitely far from being pornographic tech qualities may have been a little crude but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes many lovers of early cinema would absolutely adore this film
<START> 'the mother' is that extraordinary piece of film making it gets you thinking it pulls no punches and ultimately it leaves you thinking very much open ended as to the lead character's fate anne reid which i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria wood led projects and thought a fine comedienne is truly superb here not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all and not all that free spirited and adventurous at first she plays her character just with the right note that rings true well it did to me powerful cast great script renaissance of european cinema indeed
<START> a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults br br this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse typical plot some may say but this really was unexpected br br i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship seeing my own past in their story moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances br br it's a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love great movie i'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection
<START> well it's not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in 1980 so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine well la haine it is not i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly br br the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london but i'm concerned that film makers now use type casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence tragedy
<START> i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an art house theatre no less but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and well i wasn't disappointed that's for sure madonna has done it again yet another bomb when will this woman learn when will the studios learn or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly word of mouth one would hope that being directed by her talented husband who's created some interesting and or terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality madonna showed in desperately seeking susan alas it just isn't meant to be for here she is at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness the smugness permeating every frame she's in made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux british accent an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman and look at her films of say the past decade like a latter day bette davis there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no favors to her credit the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess no one involved escapes unharmed bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on screen though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good which had me thinking all the while denial ain't just a river in egypt adriano giannini son of giancarlo giannini star of the italian original swept away is like his father before him immensely attractive and isn't altogether bad despite winning a razzie nomination for worst actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame why her why not her husband director guy ritchie just who do you think was behind this remake what actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen oh sure ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone anyone should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters or at least display a semblance of warmth but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it a film like this an odd couple ish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can bounce off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded really be honestly i don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy i defy you to laugh even once or romance madonna's ice princess routine precludes any chemistry it's not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy a real shame
<START> the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it's something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i'd have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one
<START> the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy the best part is that i couldn't stop thinking of supertroopers thanks to joey kern i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point the thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed 22 million in the box office and only cost about 1 5 million to make congrats to lion's gate for being able to pull that one off
<START> one of the best parts of sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss unless you're a real art house devotee you probably don't catch many documentaries only a handful get any recognizable distribution fortunately sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years br br shakespeare behind bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange kentucky every year a group of inmates present a shakespearean play director hank rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self selected interpreted rehearsed and ultimately performed br br the movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments despite the labels we know them by convict felon murderer etc we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings serendipitously the play chosen for the year of filming was the tempest with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption the actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama br br for a documentary film like a book the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation for me o brave new world that has such creatures in it
<START> i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that right until the end i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was when you consider the powerful subject the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images it is a shame that little attention was given to acting br br
<START> i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly ringwald was a good move and kylie was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago
<START> 'midnight cowboy' was rated x with the original release back in 1969 there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the movie about joe buck jon voight coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love it does not work out as he planned after a guy named rico 'ratso' rizzo dustin hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends they live in an empty and very filthy apartment then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money br br the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things the editing in this movie is great we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way dustin hoffman jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines the score is done by john barry and sounds great all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason
