<START> warning review contains mild spoilers br br a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st series however just two years on and i find i can't remember enough about them in order to do it Â i guess they couldn't have made much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequels Â dream warriors in particular Â weren't as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesn't lend itself to narrative tension but while i cannot recall much of the first five films i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy's dead br br an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise the fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture was br br taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain robert englund's in no way scary interpretation booms with laughter i always thought freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe it's like englund's crying out we know this is garbage Â but you're paying to see it so who's the one laughing and i'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight was freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary all he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr Â har Â har Â hars and that's it if this was the only elm st film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all even as the character pre death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic ie overstated misplaced and not at all funny irony br br acting is almost universally poor just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language only kananga himself yaphet kotto keeps his dignity and when roseanne tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire the script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan opens a road map upon which the noel coward like freddy has wittily written you're f ked when prompted for the map carlos responds well the map says we're f ked who wrote the screenplay oscar wilde br br or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin Â a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified oddly the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect nice hearing from you carlos quips freddy hoping some better lines will come along it's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into freddy's world though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3 d finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements br br the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series tracy lezlie deane is the only one who gets to greet freddy with shut the f k up man and a kick in the scallops and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients freddy's dead no laughs no scares no interest no fun br br
<START> this movie really is a mixed bag on the one hand the story and concept of the movie are really good tense and have some nice plot twists in it but than again on the other hand it all is told very slow without style and uninvolved still i regard just cause as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast br br maybe sean connery was miscast in his role i mean he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way and husband of kate capshaw i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne blair underwood ned beatty hope lange lynne thigpen and ed harris all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer he's truly chilling and acting superbly normally he doesn't play this ruthless chilling sort of roles in movies so he really surprises with his role in this one his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant br br it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters br br it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre br br 7 10
<START> do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film i firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure the only reason it merited a star was the presence of chris pine br br nothing happens you wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge but no br br the characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers before returning to an idyllic and playful bring on the teen rock montage state the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion' br br their encounters with obstacles be they human or physical are brief confusing and entirely pointless br br chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast lou taylor pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with keanu reaves combing the navada desert br br watch 'the road' watch '28 days later' watch day time tv anything but this i implore you suffer the boredom unlike you may be led to believe in the film this film is no cure
<START> the main problem i see with this film is its score which screams with every note this is a cheap ass movie there's not much more to say here the score just plain sucked br br the second problem which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film one of the the money shots if you will is the dialogue between martha adrienne barbeau and the sunflower man richard ziman in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment at all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that s he is listening to a movie dialogue in other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience br br the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch the main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo like woman on a mission this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon barbeau to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole br br finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie br br so what's my holistic grading of this piece i'd give it a solid c to b depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism i see no problems with plot development or coherence the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half and nicholas brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performance br br all in all this film is definitely worth the view see it with a nazi you love
<START> i felt a great joy after seeing this film not because it is a master piece but because it convinced me of that the portuguese cinema became really very good we can see here the best portuguese actores in this field
<START> ever wonder why pacific islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans regardless of their ethnic origins well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question but it will provide an excellent case study br br from its onset this film acts as a sort of old school for pacific island new zealanders which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of pacific island new zealanders or is it intended to exploit this potential market the story is weak jokes humorless and the ending is expected this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit
<START> if you haven't already seen this movie of mary kate and ashley's then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much it's fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise of course as always mary kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway it's a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you won't be disappointed sincerely rick morris
<START> this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen this is a must see for anyone over the age of 16 this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance if mr wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia dome to hold all the people who will want to see it i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series it would have an amazing following
<START> this is the second baby burlesk short to be released and probably the most popular one is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory br br i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed it is just a cute little film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner' it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers there's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this that is sick to me if you watch this and are bothered by it then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the b b films were parodies nothing more the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldn't those be more appalling i can watch those without issue but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they babified not a word i know an adult movie from 1926 because we know how pornographic those silent films were huh not to mention those 'forbidden hollywood pre code era films' so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today note the sarcasm
<START> having the in laws over for the weekend then this is the film to hasten their departure failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging br br the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship which is more superannuated car ferry the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list an interesting piece of added amusement is playing spot the villain as passengers join the ship you won't be wrong with a script that sinks faster than a brick clichÃ©d set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller action movie and gore fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them br br a must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is
<START> distasteful cliched thriller has young couple doing cross country research on america's most infamous murder sites becoming road partners with a dim witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend who is an actual psycho arty and alienating the film's tone alternates between pouty pseudo irony and silly flamboyance handsomely made perhaps but ultimately laughable brad pitt's performance as the low rent killer is godawful from
<START> prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be worse than freddy got fingered i was wrong to sum dahmer up it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting it wll be less painful
<START> i simply never tire of watching freebird my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout france freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting only phil daniels could fit the role of grouch great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party following the premier in january anything else you want doing jon just ask either email or phone you know how to get me sue xx
<START> wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker stallone comes back for his girlfriend jessie janine turner while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening a spectacularly precarious mid air hijacking goes wrong and 100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landingÂ br br stranded off the snowy peaks and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash the high trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unitÂ br br unfortunately gab and hall michael rooker have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic john lithgow are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of moneyÂ br br with breathtaking shots vertiginous scenery dizzying heights perilous climbs freezing temperatures cliffhanger is definitely stallone's best action adventure movieÂ
<START> despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it it's depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedi br br film summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen it br br after the empire strikes back left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it's construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a all or nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death star's shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life br br filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
<START> spoilers sex huh it's one of the most basic parts of human life yet do we ever take it too seriously people always want more even those who get it on a daily basis and if you are unlucky there are potential life changing creating consequences ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins in steve carell's first big screen lead he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents not to mention more profanity than an episode of eurotrash the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny it's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate failed jokes there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics br br andy stitzer carell is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament at the same time though he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member andy's friends discover his secret at the age of 40 andy is still a virgin now for multiple reasons but mostly pity the three men paul rudd seth rogen and romany malco all offer andy advice with one goal in mind to put him out of his misery and get him laid br br one of the few good things about anchorman it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own impressively in the 40 year old virgin he doesn't disappoint showing the hopeless shy virgin to perfection carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help br br carell is not alone however in his performance rudd rogen malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality br br the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it's head obviously designed for conservative america the film's entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence the virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete he just needs confidence and true love a worthy message to preach and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film br br it's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted but low and behold 40 year old virgin is just that throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy a surprising joy

<START> watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as die hard in a on a cliffhanger is die hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it is br br but unlike passenger 57 and under siege which are decent die hard clones on their own terms cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks br br years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings br br the opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face can dim the sequence's power br br the next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected as roger ebert has observed the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition br br later during the avalanche sequence one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain so far as i know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera br br i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself br br in contrast to many of today's post matrix comic book inspired action heroes stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities in cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains br br it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise br br lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter but he's fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages stallone and rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says you stay you fetch even a better actor such as anthony hopkins might have had trouble with that line br br even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show br br early in the movie for example lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg br br lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor br br done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film br br besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative finally harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes br br it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list br br rating 8 very good especially considering most of stallone's other movies
<START> once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world the five members of the first expedition return see the lost world 1992 for a list of actors a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition although the situation looks hopeless i'm not going to tell you the ending
<START> ok so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955 br br i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbish br br the story is just ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it br br dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy its pathetic br br natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad precedent for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along br br it may've been good for its time but really its drivel br br it must've just been hype about dean's death that has over inflated the reputation of this film
