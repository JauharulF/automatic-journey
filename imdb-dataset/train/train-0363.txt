<START> this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicaprio tom hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi yum although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler if he were a woman they'd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler is is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the plot who cares typical teen highjinx played by adults
<START> we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating not knowing anything about this true story i thought oh no p brosnan as an american indian 'red' indian in the film what a bad choice until i discovered the truth about grey owl the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them and annie galipeau wow what a beauty and very convincing as an indian woman i believe she is french canadian she sure reverts to the all too familiar speech of such in spite of brosnan's detached grunting style in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate dedicated man the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist good film highly recommended
<START> this game is one of the best rpg fist it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack you can transform into dragoon the special attack the magic the script is very good characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support as happened in several games of final fintasy series i got bored of that dialogs about past when you just want to go on with the game's story ambientation is a jewel on this game it combines middle age fantasy with futuristic science fiction it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible i like them more than other in other modern games we can't remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now then map is huge there are all kinds of places an enemies finally music is not the best game muse i have heard but it's perfect for a game like this
<START> i was expecting a b movie french musical after all dhÃ©ry blanche defunÃ¨s were superstars of low budget french films of that time and it is in color but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity musical numbers are awful and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid and the songs what songs this is just a succession of bad numbers one after another the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women it was not familiar at that time in fact some numbers are just there to show us topless women it adds to the mediocrity and try to find young michel serrault the future great actor of french cinema in a bit part as a musician in his very first movie good luck
<START> the thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round thumbtanic wasn't as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic send up unlike star wars the movie titanic hasn't yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience br br in thumbtanic the holes are filled by one off jokes which don't really seem related to anything for example the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the jump off end of ship scene it's not funny rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf arachnid br br by contrast the send up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanic br br the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation overall although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone won't work this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end
<START> blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you're being utterly unreasonable it feels like a late era carry on when the series was no longer blazing trails but was still more funny than not think behind or england and you won't be too far off the mark pamela and denise are bubbly charming and clearly aware this isn't a masterpiece they're making although you can give me it over lots of things i'm told to like the supporting cast are energetic even if some of them aren't particularly good i can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie that's already practically forgotten making much difference to anything so just smile i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it
<START> in a time of magic barbarians and demons abound a diabolical tyrant named nekhron and his mother queen juliane who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by the king jerol but when his beautiful daughter princess teegra has been kidnapped by nekhron's goons a warrior named larn must protect her and must defeat nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named darkwolf br br a nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them rotoscoping it's ralph bakshi's second best movie only with american pop being number one and heavy traffic being third and wizards being fourth it's certainly better than his cool world or lord of the rings the artwork is designed by famed artist frank farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there's also a hottie for the guys br br i highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2 disc limited edition dvd from blue underground br br also recommended the black cauldron the dark crystal conan the barbarian the wizard of oz rock rule wizards heavy metal starchaser legend of orin fantastic planet princess mononoke nausicca valley of the wind conan the destroyer willow the princess bride lord of the rings 1978 the sword in the stone excalibur army of darkness krull dragonheart king arthur the hobbit return of the king 1980 conquest american pop jason and the argonauts clash of the titans the last unicorn the secret of nimh the flight of dragons hercules disney legend the chronicles of narnia harry potter and the goblet of fire
<START> dont let the mpaa fool you with their rated r for extreme violence there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s t i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense avoid
<START> quite simply the funniest and shiniest film comedy of all time it's certainly on my personal top ten list this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale millionaire heir arthur bach moore is a middle aged 'child' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities he also refuses to leave the bottle one day he and his personal butler hobson gielgud go shopping at bergdorf goodman's and run into petty larcenist linda minnelli arthur and linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film there are hilarious set pieces aplenty in one such scene arthur drunk throughout most of the story knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' my husband has a gun performances by everyone involved should be duly noted geraldine fitzgerald plays arthur's loving yet ruthless grandmother sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll isms he took home the oscar for this one and christopher cross provides the main theme song oscar winner best that you can do it's a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month march 2002
<START> gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime a bit slow moving especially around the middle of the series but over all enjoyable now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a winger i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam gundam 0080 and 0083 the 08th ms team and gundam seed br br i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be rip offs i e zechs marquise to the original gundam's char but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series as is seed br br if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first and then know that you are watching an au series
<START> probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly written br br the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll or could it be one of the five characters br br acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end br br the kills can't really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive br br overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
<START> i had lost faith in sooraj r barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie sooraj r barjatyagot it right this time okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun but i have always loved manie pyar kiya after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it my view a much underrated movie br br the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition it's done in present times lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage but i do the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly when prem meets poonam for the first time they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen it was a very sweet you feel nervous yet excited the song do ajnabe shows that very well getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families a twist occurs in this movie which is really good the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box br br what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam how they fall for each other is too sweet simple boy and simple girl when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it's very sweet to watch she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too he is poonam support in the film he is her happiness the movie together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever br br the direction is spot on to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop the music is amazing the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for br br what i can finally say it rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person its basically the sweetest journey ever its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeÂwell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing
<START> i am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me so i gave this a shot after all it's the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian i have watched much less of lloyd's silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i'm a much bigger chaplin fan anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn't finish it i can understand why his sound career was so limited he didn't get very good material to work with after you've seen chaplin abbott and costello the three stooges martin and lewis the marx brothers and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time 4 out of 10 don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend kelly the second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel
<START> by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet the movie never and i do mean never lets up in action it may be mild action but it's action once again every member of the cast fits perfectly the explosions were realistic the chase scenes were feasible and the fighting was incredible matt damon will forever be jason bourne br br all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception the action the stakes the plot how they do it i will never know i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie we wouldn't have this one to talk about br br so don't go see it in theaters go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you
<START> london dreams directed by vipul shah is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people it's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat ajay devgan plays arjun an aspiring pop artiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at london's wembley stadium he becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band mate manu played by salman khan who is evidently more talented than him but nowhere near as focused or ambitious arjun decides to sabotage manu when the latter's popularity threatens to outshine his own now here's where a heart to heart might have helped had arjun explained what this wembley fixation meant to him manu would have graciously backed off and let arjun fulfill his childhood dream and we'd have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel but director vipul shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours london dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back story involving arjun's grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage fright at a packed wembley concert or the ridiculous incident at a show where manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes arjun into silence the idiocy however doesn't end there in his attempts to shame manu publicly arjun uses his connections to get manu hooked onto drugs a buxom groupie urges manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine before you know it manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder practically chomping it down like dinner if that isn't silly enough there's a crude scene later in which manu chases after the said girl to find out who she's been taking orders from the pursuit ends in a dark london alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead manu's girlfriend who's been secretly following after them wait there's more expect to howl hysterically when arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the band's lead dancer priya played by asin because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals too generously inspired by milos forman's amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last year's rock on vipul shah's latest is a clunky melodrama that's as loosely directed as it is scripted the film goes for broad humor over the top emotions and basically chooses loudness over subtlety that works for manu's character with salman khan playing him all loutish and lovable but in the case of arjun ajay devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised when arjun does reach boiling point however it results in an awkward pre climax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment of the remaining cast there's not a kind word i can say for asin who practically lit up ghajini with her ebullient charm but disappoints here with unnecessary over acting in a thankless role ranvijay singh and aditya roy kapur reduced to mere sidekicks in the band show up at regular intervals usually to utter some inane dialogue like we'll rock it dude for its dim witted writing and sloppy direction london dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch if you must watch it for salman khan who's turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style it's the only thing that'll make you smile in this sad sad film
<START> there are similarities between ray lawrence's jindabyne and his last movie lantana Â a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives but whereas lantana offered some hope and resolution jindabyne leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied perhaps even cheated br br the storyline the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river is based on a short story by raymond carver it became an element in robert altman's classic 1993 ensemble short cuts lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small australian community under stress the movie poses some moral questions would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend and more poignantly for australians would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal the acting especially by gabriel byrne and laura linney is commendable and there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music not unlike picnic at hanging rock br br if all this sounds like the basis for a great movie be prepared for a let down the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning thereby eliminating the element of mystery and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale
<START> i really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie remember folks this is an snl movie not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction the ladies man is a hilarious movie albeit stupid at times with a wacked out cast and as usual wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are unbelievable but its comedy i really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film anyway all i ask is that people take this as it is an snl silly and irreverent comedy nothing that will win awards but nonetheless some modern comedy gold 10 4 apricot
<START> why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago i can say that there is little if anything from the original book i went into this film with low expectations i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it but it even failed to meet these br br this is not a prequel the only relationship it has with the original is the name this is not the story of carlito brigante it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name they have just totally spat in the face of every carlito's way fan out there adding insult to injury by casting luis guzman who plays a crucial character in the original movie in a different role br br what's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original untouched material of the book carlito's way something i really would have liked to have seen i felt the same way about chopper they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of australia's most feared underworld figure instead they made a ho hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook though eric bana's performance was spot on now we will never get to see carlito's real initial rise and fall br br the three stars is because looking at it purely as a stand alone flick it is not so appalling there are some decent performances jay hernandez is no carlito but he could be good in other roles and the story is not too bad even puffy combs suits his role but they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time i am a bit of a crime non fiction buff something which the original film and the books got right having been written by then attorney and now judge edwin torres br br the fact is though it's not a stand alone it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed
<START> i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billy's movies but couldn't remember this one and now i know why it's so full of clichÃ©s and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn't even get to be funny very often he's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor
<START> i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little too well lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film 3 1 2 out of 5
