<START> along with patrick mcgoohan and robert culp jack cassidy was an iconic columbo villain the very first proper episode of columbo following two standalone pilots murder by the book is not far off classic status br br jack cassidy plays ken franklin one half of a murder mystery writing partnership his partner jim is the talented one whereas ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill for promoting the books as soon as jim has decided he no longer requires ken's marketing skills ken hatches a plot to kill jim except it's not a new plot it's actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books br br it doesn't take columbo long to work out that ken is the murderer although unfortunately another murder has to take place ken romances and then kills a key witness before columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction br br nothing whatsoever wrong with murder by the book but it's not quite top notch i would just give publish or perish the edge over this both episodes feature jack cassidy and the world of publishing but publish or perish is a fraction more tense and unpredictable but this is still a great episode
<START> a black guy fights and supposedly wins yeah 1 10 obviously fiction br br so we're presented with a damm nice title a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line thats about it thats where it ends we move into fiction after that br br michael jai white the black guy so don't get confused with the name portrays a black guy umm thats all there is to the name br br its so hard to find decent help must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget low ineptness of this movie has the camera's shadow trailing the first scenes yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me but yeah br br 10 lines review submitted if you paid to see this movie you got screwed
<START> this film like astaire's royal wedding which was shown after it on turner classic network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kelly's record like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room's walls and ceiling this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse the sequence is nicely done what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day and sets the stage for the sequence by having stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white pomeranian navy uniform with blue stripes on it jerry mouse does more than dance with gene he actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place tom briefly appears as king jerry's butler trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses br br but the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kelly's story of the lost four day furlough in hollywood and how kelly ends up meeting katherine grayson and with frank sinatra stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio the hollywood bowl and iturbi's own home except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing br br kelly has saved sinatra's life in the pacific and is getting a medal as a result they are both among the crewmen back in california who are getting a four day leave but the script writers to propel what would be a short film kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one lola an unseen good time girl in hollywood saddle gene with frank br br it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of instruction about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women frank insists that gene help teach him how to get a girl just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy stockwell who insists on joining the navy and won't give the cops his real name and address when a protesting kelly is able to get this information out of stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt grayson still protesting kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to sinatra's simplistic soul view of things he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up he keeps getting dragged back to grayson's house as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself but needs kelly to train him in love making br br i suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh but i find this kind of story irritating while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly sinatra grayson and iturbi are first rate it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like sinatra's character seriously in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough what right has he to insist as sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense br br the stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that and keep floundering at one point for no really good reason grayson herself ruins kelly's attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi it is only sheer luck that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent br br kelly by the way ends up with grayson sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling kelly into it oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress pamela britton from his native brooklyn and naturally without any assistance from kelly sinatra and britton fall in love ah consistency thy name is not screenwriting necessarily
<START> i had pleasure to watch the short film the cure by first time director ryan jafri what really impress me are the camera work and music br br i think many young filmmakers as i myself am one of them would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie we see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambitions but this film directorial debut from a young director handled very well on screen the camera motion color lighting compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film br br and music as a key element of film language helps a great deal too br br it's hard to portray a woman's heart her desire her fear especially in a short but still i have to admit i am not a fan of v o narration especially when the film is advanced by narration instead of shots and cuts my personal feeling to some of the narrative part is my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard so the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film br br overall it's a short film nicely done i could see the input from a director way to go ryan greeting from china looking forward to your next br br tim
<START> i just saw this movie yesterday i cannot believe the reviews on this site the ones that give it over one star must be buffy fanatics well i am a buffy fan of the first order but i know crap when i see it on every level this film is terrible technically much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie even within one scene it jumps pov like crazy for no reason no logic whatsoever in cinematic terms emotionally is bleak for bleak's sake and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing throwing nasty looking red necks in your movie is a cheap way to convey atmosphere i ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act but i was having too much fun with my friends doing mst3k riffs to turn it off since leaving buffy smg has had 2 successful movies if even listing scooby doo on your resume could count gellar is a fine actress but she or her agent sure can't find a vehicle for her and mr shepard if you are having trouble paying your mortgage i'll send you a few bucks if you promise to not appear in a movie like this again also the estate of patsy cline should sue for defamation
<START> it was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies the brain is well done the script reminded me of videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before the acting can go through with it but it's the effects that makes you laugh the so called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown the opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of nightmare on elm street remember the telephone coming alive some how you keep watching this flick waiting what is happening next it's viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn't any gore in it and as said the blood isn't there neither but there is nudity for the perverts i have seen worser movies than this one only wished they had made it bloodier
<START> enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell philo vance playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the thin man series back in the 1930's william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture the famous veteran actress mary astor hilda lake becomes one of the suspects in a murder suicide case where a man named archer coe robert barrot is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside ralph morgan raymond wrede archer's secretary gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared in the wizard of oz 1939 eugene palette detective sgt heath appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in robin hood with errol flynn always remember the least likely actor could very well be the killer enjoy a great classic from the past
<START> i once thought that the stoned age was the worst film ever made i was wrong hobgoblins surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldn't in the stoned age i hated the characters in hobgoblins i hated the actors and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity i won't include a teaser to this film i'm not that cruel i couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment in fact any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning words i would use to describe this film are as follows insipid asinine and ingenuous br br in conclusion please don't watch this film i beg of you from one movie lover to another no from one human being to another please for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it destroy any copies you come across
<START> believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like low budget b movies br br sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars br br it just doesn't work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian way br br i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences br br i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen br br about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended br br to bad they didn't try that instead i just don't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldn't be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed 15 was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but more likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked br br much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
<START> this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast br br another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly demeaning work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these i e they are all firmly rooted in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja vu and too few surprises
<START> on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami lisa reisert rachel mcadams meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die br br red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the premise is similar to cellular and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense the acting and the direction most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots wes craven does a really good job behind the camera instead of focusing on the thrills he focuses on the story and the characters the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on red eye really shows his skills at storytelling br br red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate you may even end up cheering for her out loud cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and jayma mays br br the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape overall the tone of the film is consistently creepy the screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head also the ending is disappointing it isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better since the movie focuses on the characters there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed in the end red eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer rating 8 10
<START> ok first of all this movie sucks but lets examine why the proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy storing it and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing but that's as far as they take this premise instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine they break the damn thing this could have been a good premise living with the responsibilty of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation ie the invisible man but no they break the damn thing and lembach wants to leave so then the doctor jerry rigs the thing back together and trys to transport himself only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary duh which wouldn't happened if lembach hadn't decided to leave so now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed and they wouldn't give him money wah then to make the movie worse throw in a dry british relationship between the two semi competent professors hired to assist him between their loving sessions they make a couple of half hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine which would never have happened if lembach hadn't left this movie tried so i give it an honest 2 stars for effort but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine making lembach leave making him try it again damn you lembach
<START> its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it i rate it right up there with christmas vacation the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money
<START> the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information interesting entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen i have rated this film at the highest possible rating i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to their voice is never heard it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea' i look forward to viewing the sequence once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind
<START> banned as a 'video nasty' in the uk unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety however the most shocking thing i found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments the bloodletting i could handle the terrible acting shoddy editing awful direction lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take br br three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm they are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house the owner of the house a batty old lady and her spinster daughter welcome the girls in allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate however someone doesn't want the girls to leaveÂever one by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant br br taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film and that takes some doing unhinged is a truly awful film the music is a total mess it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser and as such it complements the movie perfectly only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save unhinged from getting the lowest possible score br br if you are a horror completist and unfortunately i am you will want to see this in order to tick it off the video nasty watch list but be warnedÂit is really really bad
<START> a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette davis's plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplay playwright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'angles in america' etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me br br theatrical and movie making and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot more of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
<START> i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s and it stayed with me it's charming loud colourful a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the feebles but no its wholesome clean fun br br jack wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy poo br br if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe br br even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie if like me you are into death metal you'll love it
<START> this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval kevin kostner or tom selleck attached to the cover it isn't worth messing with for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892 yet the revolvers used were 1860s models even the shooting was bad in one scene the marshal fanned his six shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting
<START> most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true br br but if i have to sit through a movie were the br br director br br director of photography br br editor br br can't even miss the darn microphone boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i'm reminded of the technicalities of making a movie br br wait for the dvd or don't bother
<START> match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but corroborated what i have known for years he shouldn't focus on neurotic rich new yorkers in this case johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky whom magician sid waterman allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel ian mcshane who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman hugh jackman so she gets to know him and well i don't know how much i can tell you without giving it away but i can say that this is probably allen's funniest movie in years there's his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religion br br so you're sure to like this movie if nothing else it'll make you fall in love with london but mostly it's just so damn hilarious even if you don't like woody allen you gotta love this one
