<START> this is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching the plot could be a lot thicker than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie br br the acting leaves something to be desired though you can not quite place your finger on what it is br br this is one of those that you watch on late night tv perhaps on usa simply because you can not get to sleep watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it
<START> simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies br br 7 out of 10
<START> shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but unexceptional
<START> out of all the princess stories disney has put out there cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal i can't really say why but for some reason generation after generation thrusts her to the top of their lists as a little girl i wanted nothing more than to be cinderella with her glass slipper it was my absolute favorite costume br br honestly i don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than cinderella who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had the story is older than the english language and somehow it still rings true br br as for the characters if nothing else disney can make a wonderful villain lady tremaine is evil to the t in a wonderfully calculating not overtly physical way her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her she doesn't need staffs of lightening to strike fear into your heart the animal friends tend to grate especially that idiotic gus i would have cheered had he met his fate in lucifer's jaws cinderella herself was no pushover making some justly catty remarks at times however she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic sure she was nice and fed animals but what was keeping her at that place we never know even if she only became a maid in another house at least she's be getting paid and have a shot at respect it seems the only reason things work out in the end for cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap she never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of br br which brings me to the music which is lovely as ever ilene woods has a lovely rich voice probably my favorite of any disney heroine some big standards originated here a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love bibbidi bobbidi boo br br cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights while it is lacking in some character development it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work if you are feeling sick at heart pop it in it'll warm you up and make you hum mmm mmm good br br quote of the film br br surprise surprise duh duh duh happy birthday
<START> silent night deadly night 5 is the very last of the series and like part 4 it's unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it's a christmas themed horror flick br br except to the oblivious there's some obvious things going on here mickey rooney plays a toymaker named joe petto and his creepy son's name is pino ring a bell anyone now a little boy named derek heard a knock at the door one evening and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him even though it said don't open till christmas he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself inside is a little red ball that sprouts santa arms and a head and proceeds to kill dad oops maybe he should have left well enough alone of course derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs but he doesn't grow up to be some killer santa he just stops talking br br there's a mysterious stranger lurking around who seems very interested in the toys that joe petto makes we even see him buying a bunch when derek's mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma and what exactly is this guy doing well we're not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick he does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a larry the larvae toy for his kid but of course larry is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course well things aren't pretty br br anyway eventually what's going on with joe petto and pino is of course revealed and as with the old story pino is not a real boy pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from kenitalia a smooth plastic crotch so that could account for his evil ways and the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too and there's even kind of a happy ending of sorts whee br br a step up from part 4 but not much of one again brian yuzna is involved and screaming mad george so some decent special effects but not enough to make this great a few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too like clint howard and neith hunter but that doesn't really make any difference anyway i now have seeing the whole series out of my system now if i could get some of it out of my brain 4 out of 5
<START> this film is exactly what its title describes an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer br br first it's kinda fun to see the 1996 style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts sunglasses clothes and attitude it really hasn't changed any just a nice safe cheap provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types it's also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to l a and find out that it's toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach bums musicians fortune tellers and yet more uppity film types br br i don't see pitch as a film to be enjoyed it's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations being trampled i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses would be and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big time br br so kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning buy it or don't but the message is still there
<START> i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu i thought it kicked a s it was so creative and unique it's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama even if some thought there was too much special fx yeah right you can't complain about the cast zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine the legend of zu kicks a s
<START> mistress of the craft celeste works as an agent for the london branch of interpol's bureau 17 which specializes in i think occult criminals she possesses the eye of destiny good in her hands dangerous if anyone else got it br br bureau 17 has caught a satanist from california hyde no relation to dr jekyll detective lucy lutz of lapd flies to england to bring him back to the us lutz is the connection to the earlier witchcraft movies having been played by stephanie beaton before in witchcraft 9 in part 7 lutz was played by another woman in 6 lutz was a man br br lutz's part in 9 was not terribly big but she's one of the main stars in this one though she's left behind her high heels and short skirts she still has revealing tops in this one and this time around she has nude and sex scenes beaton is pretty appealing in the role br br as usual there are a number of sex scenes an anonymous clubgoer has a fatal threesome with two vampires the satanist and head vampire get it on with some kink lutz finds an english pal and celeste and her boyfriend make love br br the main recurring character of the witchcraft series will spanner does not appear in this one although lutz mentions him to bureau 17 agent dixon in a conversation about vampires she also phones her partner detective garner parts 6 7 and 9 though we don't hear his end of the conversation br br hyde is sprung from jail by a group of vampires led by raven for a walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named morsheba i think hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner while raven overacts to a campy degree the fight scenes are terribly choreographed br br the audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded and poorly edited additionally some dialogue gets lost under blaring music or sirens cinematography isn't great either having the movie set in and actually shot in the uk was a bit of a novelty though at least for this series br br wendy cooper is very good as celeste attractive certainly but more importantly she's easily the best actor in the movie bad fight scenes notwithstanding i'm quite surprised her filmography is so small if there's ever a witchcraft xiv and i would bet there will be they should bring her back even if it means flying her to california br br witchcraft x is available on its own or in the dvd collection hotter than hell along with witchcraft xi and two unrelated movies
<START> well no i tell a lie this is in fact not the best movie of all time but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seen br br it's a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat morita mr miyagi with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something but that doesn't matter the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends the whole culture difference thing is done quite well in that it's fun to watch it's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way the soundtrack is cool once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way it suits the movie i've been trying to find one of the songs for ages but as i'm working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i can't seem to find it br br another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i won't give that one away oh no in conclusion i'd take this movie over 48 hours most of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names if you're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop give this a shot you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop br br i'm giving this 7 to be honest i like it more than that i'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff i'd give 8 but i guess i know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie
<START> my father was the warden of the prison he is retired now showcased in this documentary and i've grown up around the prison life so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie i will say this the filmmakers who brought us this 93 minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people they were brave enough to a show up and tell this story b get inside these inmates minds and hearts and c do all of this responsibly responsible to their art and more importantly responsible to the inmates and staff of luther luckett correctional complex they should be commended without end for this work to take 170 hours yes hours of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect br br i saw this film under circumstances that only a very very few were able to see it i was at the inmate screening i was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen i saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you it was a very profound experience these men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves even if they view themselves as unredeemable how many of us have the courage to do this how many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment to see them react to the film was an experience i am eternally grateful for and i will never forget that i thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives i thank my father for making all of this possible and i thank philomath films for taking the time to pour their blood sweat soul and tears into this project br br this movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the inmates held within it 'oz' is not real television is not real 'shakespeare behind bars' is
<START> standard paint by numbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big creature movies it's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were shuffled and dealt whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script br br characters are so clichÃ© ridden that you can play a game of guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one right including the order that they will get devoured many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls a capt ahab guy with a vendetta and ahab's girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapy br br along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet t shirts couples make out on exotic beaches explosions occur ruins of a shrine appear and greasy faced pirates drop by br br amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed after one violent demise they make one liner jokes i could almost hear rim shots br br overall ok if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a so bad it's good movie otherwise you may want to skip this one
<START> this film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure it had 30 actors after jaani dushman 2002 i guess no one had the guts to do something like that br br the film as the title suggests is based on the kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring br br even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes wonder which soldier does that br br direction by jp dutta pales front of border music is okay br br amongst the huge cast ajay devgan stands tall saif is very good in his part and also it's his first film with kareena abhishek is likable manoj bajpai has his moments sanju is wasted suneil is okay akshaye khanna does his part well rest are passable rani is good esha is okay rest are passable
<START> my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg 1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season 5 the show took a different focus still good but different br br the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt br br the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable br br the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch br br starting somewhere around season 5 the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goa'uld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature br br one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes they are simply can't miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons br br if you are a sci fi fan watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to
<START> i'm 47 years old and i've spent as much of my life as i can remember a fan of horror and sci fi films be they silent black and white no budget or big budget there are very few of them that i can't find something to like about that said i'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all this is a case of effects over story truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good original story a good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie this movie doesn't even have good acting only good effects so unless you can only about the gore pass this one up
<START> based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time the great 19th century american poet and humanist walt whitman made a significant contribution to how western medicine treats people with psychological problems br br interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients after seeing the psychological methods of the time inhumane and ignorantly cruel methods walt rejected those methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity encouraging other people to do the same the story of walt's interactions with psychiatric workers patients and townsfolk is full of drama good humor and wisdom
<START> when i was 11 grease 2 was like crack it was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience my sister and i would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another so if you are an 11 year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass br br if however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution and or consumption br br for the sake of criticism i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blowsÂ br br 1 in a well executed musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters in grease 2 with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way score tonight reproduction do it for our country and prowlin' without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance br br 2 the t birds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussy dufus loser in the end when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t bird jacket and initiates him into the gang michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it but of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the t birds br br 3 since michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slack jawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat so aside from being pretty i guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael's attraction to her br br i could go on and on but i didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair i will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake grease 2 is an experience akin to re living your first kiss only you are 32 now and kissing a snot nosed 13 year old kid with acne and slobby braces the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed trust me
<START> sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight well cast suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground new york city how he got insurance let alone the budget after all those flops is a mystery also the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene br br two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents the only victim is going to be the insurance company the robbery goes awry and two people die most of the film is concerned with the aftermath the action is non linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view but it is not difficult to follow what is not so easy to work out is the back story Â how did the brothers get into such a mess there are clues Â the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father and vice versa but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin using murdering embezzler br br as the scheming older brother a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied inadequate younger brother albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that marisa tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance i've seen in many a year the film literally starts with a bang but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly br br i don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet's great 70's film dog day afternoon it is based on fact Â it's too silly to be untrue lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys this isn't a classic of either sort Â it's a well crafted piece of downbeat entertainment it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one but still wondering as to how they got that way we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant well like tolstoy we have to conclude that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
<START> or at least one of the best i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64 bowser is up to his usual shenanigans yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of and mario must stop him again this game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia to me the only bad thing about it is the graphics which are awful to today's standards but everything else is pretty good especially the little mini games you can unlock it's the second best n64 game the first best is conker's bad fur day that i recommend to any mario fan or any fan of platform games it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day br br 9 10 or a
<START> spoilers wow this is a bad one i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other day it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts and there was stewart moss a k a the unlikable 'hero' of it lives by night he played the first crewmember infected who dies from terminal depression all i could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times that's what caused the depression this movie is full of truly unlikable people there is no redeeming character in the film not one it's very hard to feel bad about dr beck's turning into a bat or whatever he actually turned into because you just don't like him and you don't like his shrill bony wife or the nasty sleazy sgt ward or dr mustache love so why would you invest any time or energy in this movie where there is no empathy with the characters there is no reason to bother caring about it not to mention the horrible cinematography which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through urine and the five cent bat special effects many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying not the worst film i've ever seen on mst3k but down there in the bottom ranks definitely
<START> like wearing a hair shirt positively absolutely without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever pure torture zero stars out of ten one long tedious labored pretentious self conscious theatrical and leadenly artsy scene after another intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic the soul bared it is instead morose mush br br half naked father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers homo erotic is the point loud and clear ok so what br br repeated more than once by the son is the line supposedly lifted from lives of the saints a father's love crucifies a loving son lets himself be crucified the parallel to god and his son christ is heavy handed irrelevant and bombastic like everything else here br br some reference points to the theme of russian filiality mother and son 1997 the return andrei zvyagvatsev 2003 little odessa james gray 1994 turgenev fathers and sons and of course dostoyevsky the brothers karamazov br br credits in english indicate intended international distribution meaning that the excuse cannot be used that you have to be russian to understand this mess br br this is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as sokurov's last russian ark 2003 br br as in his mother and son an equally powerful soporific some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors though not as interestingly the film is almost monochromatic shot from start to finish through beige filters making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing a soft focus haze only adds to the drugged feeling br br an annoying soundtrack drones on never shuts up like a tape loop an old radio constantly plays in the background russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as themes based on tchaikovsky the presence of a sound designer sergei moshkov signifies of course that all those irritating little sounds radio static noises distortion and such are designed br br it's hard to believe someone sergei potepolov actually wrote this thing it all seems as arbitrary as traffic as if improvised by bored actors popping out of nothingness into nothingness br br modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the thing without being the thing so that what we behold is the idea of the idea empty as a shell but not even a shell merely the idea of a shell could one ask for a better definition of decadence
