<START> like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video br br i recall seeing it at about age 12 on the the late show circa 1972 i too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses i don't recall the more horrific bits i've seen described here they were likely cut out for the tv audience but the scenes i really liked were the ones involving the death of lord kitchener aboard the hms hampshire almost exactly 90 years ago the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling as i recall br br don't recall the musical score but the comments of the others now have me curious get this one out on video
<START> this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen it does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ it is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his zeal chris saranden's jesus is playful and serious faithful and committed very human while also divine the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others
<START> some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them this is also a film a film of an acquired taste br br my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i e the parasitical aliens from outta space infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible br br you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror gore genre however cleverly maintains its own originality well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host to then pick another fight with another infected host and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away br br great but like i said of an acquired taste so don't be surprised if you don't like the film it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty with the creatures aliens things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons i e saws drills blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next br br so if you like gore you like aliens you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere then i must recommend this film as a must see i just wish i came across this earlier then i did
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen the avengers held this dubious honorÂ but no longer the acting in jill the ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes it doesn't know whether it wants to be an s m flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be reworked into a porn it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldn't do the damage to dolf lundgren's career the way that this movie has
<START> with the death of her infirmed husband may an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible dead from the neck down and unwelcome in the pseudo sophisticated yuppie homes of her son bobby and his shallow wife helen and paula a self absorbed clinging and minimally talented daughter the central family is anything but warm supportive and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else br br as may comes to realize the world is still important to her the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter's boyfriend a carpenter and rough sort may embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him br br this is the kind of role hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them but would never appear in because the film's frankness overt sexuality unglamorous wardrobe little makeup and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society most film industry women are enchrenched the performance by the lead actress anne reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face lift hair extensions and liposuction she bares more than her soul for the screen br br daniel craig is the enabling handyman derrek who beds both mother and daughter he turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow's situation but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen house his aimless character's inability to say no to the ex wife boring girlfriend and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence while good with his hands at building a conservatory he is unable to construct meaning in his life br br one of the best films from britain in years it is simply adult in its storyline the mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for american audiences to tolerate having no car chase no bling no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by tv starlets and buff studmuffins the mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook send to the retirement home and get out of the way may doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by darren isn't willing to go to the old folks home and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age
<START> i really don't understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic br br eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make up everything br br the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executed br br don't watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch
<START> i'm not to keen on the pallbearer it's not too bad but just very slow at the times as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant i really like david schwimmer and i think he's good here i'm not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan but i don't mind her sometimes and she's okay here the pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it
<START> i got a dvd of bogeyman and this stunker was an extra feature i assumed that it was boogeyman ii because it was paired with the original but you know what they say about those who assume it makes an ass out of u and me i had read before viewing that bii contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress love while watching return of the boogeyman i decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death by toothbrush scene before i knew it the film was over rip off i think that i thought this was bii because this has a similar title to one of bii's alternate titles oh well at least this was just an extra feature right br br let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes many many mistakes who does this guy ulli whatever think he is does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms there is nothing original holding part iii up it is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic who is giving us a gruelingly boring play by play as everything happens that's the movie oh and one death by stereo scene but you can read that off someone else's review my interest in boogeyman ii is forever lost br br final note this is not a series of films to watch back to back
<START> ok so i know of this movie because of a friend of mine's in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming so from a personal stand point i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem if you dig at all on info regarding this movie you'll find it's mired in legal troubles even over 7 years after being filmed so if you are at all like me then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy my source ebay about 15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail it was a very rough grainy copy of a screener only release complete with annoying top mini time code but alas i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you from what i have gleaned it's been released on dvd in germany now spain with that good luck happy searching bidding the score sndtrk is worth it alone very eclectic and varied somethinbg rare these days imho in film i think that will be my next sndtrk score to locate but i digress br br now onto the review the film opens as billy zane's character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in he steals her clothes even shoes and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank loan shop but after escaping with the loot well i guess this is where the plot begins he inadvertently looses it after perpetrating several campy over the top crimes dalliances to various a to c list celebs to locate the money he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office bank and even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout he never gets seen or nabbed he sees daily newspapers reporting his crimes this i liked because it gave the thin plot an extension after all it's a movie see fiction director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to 1 bring wood's vision to fruition and 2 give it an updated feel yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with ahh local l a 99 stores so well hence my 9 rating if the period and props were authentic i would have given it a 10 now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it to me it had promise action and comedy all up till the end so with all that said locate a copy at your own discretion br br just realize that as there is no dialouge except for some narration and singing this may be up your alley maybe not but i definitely think it's worth a watch the actors all do fine performances and it's only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction then i would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days or will in the future too i am sure
<START> and i don't say it in a bad way br br i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7 for me and my cousins it was magical beautiful and scary at the same time when we left the theatre michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it br br over the years i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart and i liked it that way br br so i've only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again if i saw it today i know i couldn't help but criticise mj's acting the plot if there was one and this and that for me this is a childhood memory so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago br br i see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though this is definitely worthy of a 10
<START> this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film
<START> a boring movie about a boring town in the 50's how can anyone think this is a classic the producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend cybil shepard into several movies that were way above her acting ability i think this movie gives an insight to how bad peter bogdonovitch's future movies were going to be cybil shepard's career took a dive after being in several movies that peter bogdonovich produced it wasn't until moonlighting that her career started to come back i thought the acting was poor rendition of the graduate i have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the us the only place i have watched it was overseas in europe late at night
<START> silly hilarious tragic sad inevitable br br a group of down and outs team up with a seasoned crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty great idea if you ignore the screwup factor br br nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn't new i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before br br very well done guys
<START> i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful ridiculous western ever made painful is the best word i can think of to describe it br br on the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well spoken rhonda fleming my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon who played the cripple who acted well enough in an annoying role written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance the production values were quite good which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay br br things i hated stewart granger looked so little like a western figure what with his british accent neat tailored outfit and silly immaculate always white kerchief tied around his neck it got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger and he never spoke up or replied back i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes the worst being at the end where granger miraculously speedily and single handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy's cattle will pass through and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying them all save the two main bad guys next worst is everything about the plot which is loaded with soap opera scenes nothing in the movie seemed believable i couldn't believe what all the conflict was about the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way i don't see why something couldn't have been worked out you need a land ownership dispute for that don't bother to see it
<START> sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
<START> i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks danny glover was cast as the bad guy but again most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role also jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student the tension was just not there since the killer was known very early the finale was again neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next all we could wait for was the end of the movie all in all a disappointing evening spent at the cinema
<START> i thought the movie was a poor documentary nothing of substance was discussed it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science most scientists appeared stereotyped and sometimes weird a woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot only children that were helped she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards playing humble scientist are we i have equations dancing in my head another said i don't see how that explains anything to us it hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture politics of science were barely touched br br not a bad flick for a 10 14 year olds other than that i felt it was boring and unrevealing br br 4 10
<START> br br this movie sucks ridiculous school athmosphere unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the good teacher nick nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as kittens br br if this works for you it doesn't for me 0 out of 10
<START> i am a huge fan of say anything jerry maguire and almost famous i wasn't that big on singles so it's safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldn't like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowe's other films well having just seen it let me say that the former was correct and the latter couldn't have been more wrong it is a very weird movie and nothing really comes together until the end anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory anyway the movie was stellar and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released i was moved by the film and felt emotionally spent by the end this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion if the viewer allows him herself into the plot in the theatre in which i saw the movie there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot i'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this i don't mean that to sound pompous but some people are more cut out for the seagal chan van damme genre of movies and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie it is very cerebral so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender as well as much thought afterwards br br as far as comparing this film to other crowe movies it is very similar in at least one regard in all crowe movies the soundtrack is a character unto itself this is almost definitely due to crowe's longstanding ties to music as anyone who has seen almost famous knows and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise's acting and crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire in my mind that is not a bad thing br br anyway if i had to compare this movie to any one other film i would say this if you enjoyed david fincher's the game you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky
