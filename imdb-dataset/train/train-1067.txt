<START> i caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film it has all the elements of a good teen film and more this film aside from dealing with boys girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people br br the film has that real life feel to it no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes which for this movie was right that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film some of which we probably know from where we live br br overall a good movie fun to watch br br 8 10
<START> if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story br br one might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders as it will invariably do during this pointless film br br one might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing br br
<START> finally we have before us a category iii movie for the summer 2006 season made of equal parts cruelty crime and passion dog bite dog benefits not merely from an apt title but also flexible direction superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved of course there has to be a catch manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies yet all told dbd represents the mature spirit we'd love to see more of in the hk mainstream br br it also marks the heralded return of edison chen long absent since the initial d debacle of a year ago chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee whose knack for alternating between physical comedy crazy 'n' the city no problem 2 and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we've seen from him since made in hong kong br br together the duo makes dog bite dog and hopefully edison's going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence his touch transformed projects from princess d to the infernal affairs saga and still he remains a rare occurrence br br mostly upon commencing dbd showcases some mesmerizing imagery playing gorgeous tricks with light shadow and perspective the soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer matt chow previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes dog bite dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner br br rest assured though this isn't a horror movie instead following a path trodden before by classic one nite in mongkok albeit from a miles more perverse angle replacing daniel wu's reluctant mainland assassin character we have edison playing a nameless killing machine hailing from cambodia's underworld sent hong kong way to execute a single target the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film's brilliant visuals br br although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up on by a cid team sent to investigate this assembly features a nice cameo by mob movie stalwart lam suet and good support from tv star wayne lai however sam lee's renegade officer wai leads the charge revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless we gradually learn wai's inner conflict stems from his father's police corruption background evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues br br a minor body count transpires as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no no there's quite the violence quotient in store even though gore per se feels toned down in places and adult language only makes a token appearance once more no nudity leading one to conclude cat iii's are being handed these days a bit hastily still dbd's a relatively mature theatrical release and we applaud its arrival br br in between the fighting stabbing hacking and shooting even a career murderer needs some romance and just like daniel wu had cecilia cheung in one nite so does intrepid mr chen get a sweetheart done beautifully by new comer pei pei her unnamed character lots of anonymity in this one meets edison's at a strangely deserted landfill abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape when the killer ditches hk he agrees to take her with him and they go on the run together love blooming en route while the movie doesn't linger on lovey dovey stuff our hearts go out to pei pei's tragic character and her endless suffering she renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well establishing that there aren't any good or bad guys here evinced by the highly sobering finale br br director cheang soi's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller home sweet home and love battlefield with eason chan two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by dog bite dog's sinister demeanor cheang manages to keep dbd flowing throughout and considering the many parts in play here stands up to critical standards erected by people like johnny to in his watershed nocturnal epic the mission a couple of glitches do come about to wit edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest but these are highly forgivable br br marking triumphant returns for two young talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the city's movie heyday to come back dog bite dog doesn't stand out for story its forte lies in strong portrayals and style buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse br br hk has a long time honored tradition of stories to do with the city's nighttime alter ego something dog bite dog upholds lovingly amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece br br rating
<START> take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the debauchery flow it was like a real life version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust temptation pure and simple the ultimate test for a relationship br br people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldn't watch but you can't help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
<START> possible spoiler adam sandler is usually typecast in comedy but in reign gives a deeply moving performance while there are people who showed courage facing post september 11 2001 sandler plays fineman a widower who is lonely and lost in his own world johnson cheadle a practicing dentist encounters his old college buddy sandler and wants to catch up on old times we see as in rain man dustin hoffman fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations oldies music appears to be a comfort and psychological crutch for him to lean on br br johnson looks for in fineman that certain pleasure and ease missing in his family he also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his job in the same instance he also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social cracks i came away from this movie with a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families
<START> my flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it together br br the first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy post mtv texture fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the moment br br when the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one over dosed amphetamine things just don't make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching it br br first you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary domino's lesbian come on on lucy liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion br br then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about domino's character br br then i thought it's probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc but soon this impression is dispelled by another u turn of the plot br br this time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afro american woman who fakes driver's licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother lateesha stars on jerry springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter br br what does this have to do with the main plot urgh well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300 000 br br then at some point you start to think oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the movie br br plus there are numerous other sub plots the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan the love story between domino and chocco the mescaline episode the fbi surveillance operation br br can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear it is a veritable mess
<START> part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i shan't therefore give away much more suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong minded woman who is drawn to him it's about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to second guess the ending
<START> let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's seriously this one was downright awful br br there are way too many elements that martino tries to inject and none of them work except for the croc gone wild thing very well at all there are some ignorant westerners of course who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere i don't even remember where it takes place how sad is that basically people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'alligator god' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well sounds good yeah well don't get your hopes up there is minimal violence until the end the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable br br there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator like a dart into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking i'm not kidding in another wonderfully crafted special effect a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van a few minutes ago he was only big enough to eat a human but now he dwarfs a full size cargo van it is really pathetic the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno mattei's masterpiece rats what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who couldn't be terrified br br normally i'd say anything sergio martino was a solid must see but this one is a must pass waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the 15 sticker price from no shame this one is a shame br br 2 out of 10 kids
<START> the snobs and pseudo experts consider it a far cry from de sica's best the ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece de sica spoke in a very direct way his italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern italian filmmakers or the bitter self parody of pietro germi the pungent bittersweetness of mario monicelli the solemnity of visconti or the cold observation of antonioni de sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep there is no attempt to intellectualize miracolo a milano and in a lesser degree il giudizio universale are realistic fairy tales or what today we call magic realism the film is a gem from beginning to end and toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that naturally requires for you to have a heart cinema in its purest form magnificent
<START> slow boring extremely repetitive no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself and quit producing there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the preacher is a joke the whole idea is not funny you can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature i am so sorry i rented this movie i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it it is completely garbage filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy
<START> i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue underground's set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule and that's mainly because bakshi's american pop 1981 just turned up on late night italian tv see my review of that film below br br anyway i found the film to be a quite good sword and sorcery animated epic with especially impressive looking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasn't exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed especially interesting is the villainous ice lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well endowed her bra could be torn off any second and half naked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass still it's clearly an action oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving darkwolf being particularly savage the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains' lair inside a cave br br in the long run apart from the afore mentioned frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the beastmaster 1982 but also animated tv series such as blackstar 1981 82 and he man and the masters of the universe 1983 85 br br as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 1 2 br br vintage featurette on the sword and sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live action 'performances' in a studio of segments from the script which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behind the scenes featurettes on the art of animation on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets for instance it's doesn't make for a very compelling piece
<START> a super unusual film from audiard read my lips is a pulpy lonely hearts thriller it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean pierre jeunet unconventionally beautiful she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film versatile and capable of a subordinate profile br br this is almost the definition of her role as carla a put upon office dogsbody taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness yet she finds an ami d'exploitation if you like in cassel's ex con paul each exploits the other's unconventional talents theft and lip reading to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement devos audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant warped inner world with discreet stylish flair br br in this film 2001 audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit a prophet of nine years later 7 10
<START> cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love br br this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is not bad as such but with redgrave toni collette glenn close meryl streep clare danes natasha richardson eileen atkins patrick wilson hugh darcy and others all giving fine performances you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance br br wait for cable
<START> i saw this film on television years ago but here several years after i wake up in the morning and still remember her face br br this film is the most profoundly terrifying film i have seen
<START> i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise i left the theater with a smile on my face one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story hilarious it has some great character actors in it too mindy sterling is in it and is very good i loved her in austin powers howard hesseman is also terrific i remember him from head of the class i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made this is fun and light and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd i will definitely buy it
<START> i saw this movie twice i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie i'm also a movie theatre director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty images br br what most of romanians don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers pintilie should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu
<START> disney have done it again brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them i love this film and watch it over and over again it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure then he meets pumbaa and things do change together they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films the rest you already know
<START> ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man john carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally one condition they must spend one week in his estate to get the money and if any of them die the others get more guess what happens next br br i saw a brand new print of this film on cable the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful that's about all the good things i can say about it br br let's list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called igor and elga come on some of the sound recording was so bad i couldn't make out the dialogue no great loss i'm sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief even pro jeff morrow was terrible the only fairly good acting was from trouper faith domergue who deserved better than this and john carradine who looks painfully old and frail here i do have to admit though the closing line in this movie is a gem br br why this was renamed legacy of blood is beyond me there's another 1978 horror film with that name br br whatever its name is it's a bad movie to be avoided at all costs
<START> boy girl love affair sequel with songs only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow movie buffs out there actually like this movie it has fans i must say the mind reels grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames like jaws 2 or exorcist ii no it whimpers along in slow motion and often just plays dead it looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and although she doesn't embarrass herself it's a role worth forgetting a misfire on the lowest of levels no stars from
<START> one of the biggest hits of 1926 brown of harvard is a exciting comedy drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star it's patented haines all the way brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man hero and wins the girl no one worked this formula like haines a terrific comic actor little annie rooney with mary pickford show people with marion davies haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines with lon chaney and west point with joan crawford where he repeats the formula mary brian is good as the girl jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate ralph bushman is the rival edward connelly mary alden david torrence guinn williams and grady sutton co star this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne's film debut as a yale football player but i never spotted him haines was a top five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 it's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time
