<START> argh this film hurts my head and not in a good way br br maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals i still regarded this film with dislike now i utterly despise it br br take one fairly good fast paced story keep the title and throw the rest away instead use some half assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena what about the cameras why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room br br the whole film screams eighties from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes ugh br br don't watch this film i know some people liked it but some people get off on being peed on and i don't understand them either
<START> i think it was an overrated pg 13 crap at least brittany snow's performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid boring and completely unoriginals the movie was very boring too and very overrated it wasn't suspenseful at all i almost fall asleep its another bad pg 13 remake its really a dreadful movie imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring the movie is pretty slow too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a 2 10
<START> watching kroko i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development e g kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot wise chances to do so uninspired actors non evolving plot i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu the story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story
<START> i watched this movie as a preview of a matthew barney art exhibit it certainly prepared me i almost skipped the exhibit and in retrospect probably should have br br aside from the score being great bjork and the photography rich and colorful the content was mostly tedious and predictable gee i really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl divers were up to the film was mostly a silly mixture of japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mock hunt harvest the film peaks with enough gratuitous shock art to turn your stomach br br what was the point of the movie while others might argue that it is an anti whaling piece one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling personally i think it was barney's attempt at flashing the audience with his anal fecal self mutilation and cannibalistic fetishes br br bottom line unless you really get off on barney's sense of art don't bother seeing this movie the message is obscure the pace slow and the cultural references pretentious if you're after shock art you'll do better at one of the many undead movies or hunting down an old copy of hustler and taking in a fecal cartoon
<START> i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn't have high hopes for it i figured it was another you got served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this to my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matinÃ©e showing of this movie so you don't spend too much i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones go see the movie and judge for yourself hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released br br edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1
<START> what the movie the 60s really represents to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times is the turbulence and diversity of the decade despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear br br not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times two basic things changed our world then the 1964 civil rights act and the overwhelming influence of the media those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized br br from chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values bear in mind however that the bulk of americans were not involved in this they worked they played they watched the news and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities the civil rights workers the political activists the anti war efforts the war on poverty br br the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored and at worst misrepresented middle class americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters they were confused too let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk protest movement there are no beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them br br i think if you didn't live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut roles were constantly changing br br the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family they represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise for the sake of peace br br the black family comprises a minister and his son disproportionately i think i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos it was clearly a message directed to today's youth br br we are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us the 60s were unusual in that way and only the roaring 20s compare in other words this movie has a moral after all in the end it is our collective individualism that survives put that in your oxymoron list br br everyone was a god a guru or a free spirited genius in the 60s it was a time of magic and madness no one will ever nail the 60s down right it was too diverse this movie is close at least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed america for the better
<START> t z post college professor receives a false letter stating he inherited 750 000 now with financial means he withdraws his life savings of 4 000 and decides to finally going out live after having his baggage sent on a train to chicago he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe and decides there good enough for him to put on a show on broadway the night of the show poor prof post has to hide from his creditors settle the relationship woes between girlfriend pansy and floozy diva eleanor and still make sure the show must go on after watching many of keaton's silent gems this one is a pain to sit through but i felt it could have been a lot worse supporting cast durante todd selwyn come off very annoying at times but still likeable a pre charlie chan toler is good as the frustrated show director 90 of the script is badly written as mgm is trying to pass this off as a poor man's marx bros film where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning compiled with keaton's drinking problems at the time this movie just is a sad moment in buster's life rating 3
<START> i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didn't cared much about tom cruise's acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character they merge and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesn't come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch gleefully it carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop corns it certainly needs more than that
<START> this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the ohio valley are i'm from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are i've lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there we laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else br br aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dread br br martha's character was the worst drawn it's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isn't shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurt br br just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level
<START> i consider this movie a masterpiece but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it so as to realize what a great movie it was first it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies in particular german soldiers army and the nazi government are shown more humanized one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention by the end of the movie of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze another clue for those who like the details is the representation of doors fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door or a door is opened many doors are shown in the screen opened and closed and the characters change in their personality their acts etc any time that happens have you noticed that
<START> as a kid i loved this game i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored then streets of rage 2 came out and we quickly forgot that this one even existed br br you play as ex cops axel stone adam or blaze fielding who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way there are 8 levels to work thru in a run down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x beating up all the bad guys and the end of level boss is much fun level 4 the bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river you even have the chance to become mr x's right hand man at the end of the game at a price this leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr x but never mind br br streets of rage also has truly fantastic music the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis the main theme level one level 4 and final boss are standout tunes br br as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console but with streets of rage 2 also available it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete br br pros br br average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game br br great tunes br br easy to get into and hard to put down br br cons br br vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2 br br poor enemy ai baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss br br lack of combo moves br br lack of decent weapons br br bad guy models are repeated far too often br br graphics b sound a gameplay b lasting appeal b
<START> this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store br br if you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and attacking people congratulations you've just made hood of the living dead now see if a distribution company will buy it from you br br i have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies
<START> well its official they have just killed american pie the first 3 were absolutely hysterical but this one and the others have been awful i mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses i mean come on talk about a weak plot the first three dealt with growing up change and marriage which are all worthy points of development in human society br br the new stifler is the biggest joke i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar i give this movie a 3 because there is 2 3 funny bits in the film br br the best character in this movie of course is jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films
<START> not to be confused with lewis teague's alligator 1980 which actually is an excellent film this il fiume del grande caimano laboriously ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies including the rather watchable l'isola degli uomini pesce and the not so good la montagna del dio cannibale tracing outrageously the plot of jaws the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable stelvio cipriani's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile's meal no thrill out of this rather laughters actually and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude we could excuse badly made films and poor fxs but not that kind of mentality never
<START> ok i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why i haven't seen it since but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film again i don't know why but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes br br comedy is hard much harder than any drama doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong is there anything worse than a bad comedy steve martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reason br br elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the philedelphia story it entertains from start to finish brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes br br one point of contention the ending it seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy the ending tries to be a love story somewhat undermining the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point then there is the tassle scene whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock one more rewrite for the ending was needed br br this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail but if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you you'll laugh i guarantee it
<START> america a land of freedom of hope and of dreams this is the nation that since its independence has striven to bring democracy prosperity and peace to the entire world for the good of all mankind there are times however when one cannot help but wish that the american's would just stay on their side of the atlantic br br this 'movie' and i use that word with some reservations evokes these feelings with an intense purity this vision of hell follows the adventures of calvin a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of marlon wayan onto the body of a two foot high dwarf after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of vanessa a career woman who is reluctant to have children calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her so as any normal man would calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year old and parks himself upon the poor woman's doorstep where he is discovered by darryl the broody husband of vanessa br br darryl incongruously falls for calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth stubble a tattoo a knife scar and the sex drive of a 16 year old even more absurdly vanessa doesn't see past calvin's baby wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts and fails to find humour in rape scatology sexual assault and paedophilia however in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of 'family entertainment' the wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality br br the brothers dim attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he had a bad father repeatedly hitting darryl in the crotch enables calvin to develop the loving father son relationship that both he and darryl have always wished for as if this wasn't ridiculous enough calvin's attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little woman who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband br br in this movie the wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichÃ©d sentimentality that has infected much of hollywood's recent body of work additionally they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming african american humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over indulges in fart jokes and crude sexual gags by rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again br br unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals
<START> an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film br br shameful since it warrants having a wider audience br br a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film br br my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film br br
<START> melissa joan hart shines this show is amazing there is no match except for maybe melissa in clarissa explains it all she was marvelous in that too this is so much better than buffy the vampire slayer this show is wonderful
<START> i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation for romantic comedies feature age old clichÃ©s which make a movie uninteresting typically in a romantic comedy there is a girl and there is a guy both fall in love then have troubles and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever but this movie is a different story it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately br br there is a widowed guy dan there is a girl marie dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime after sometime marie has to leave dan develops something for her and when this something starts to turn meaningful we get a twist marie is the girlfriend of his brother unheeded of the circumstances dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her and even marie loves him but their love would not just be possible how it is made possible forms the rest of the story br br steve carell performs well juliette binoche is good as marie and every other stuff is done well it is a good movie watch it
<START> i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett o'hara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved melonie not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayed br br one can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49th parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal westerner canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isn't the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up br br i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful or try to be soulful witness his poet dreamer wanderer in the petrified forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart the character of philip carey in somerset maugham's of human bondage is soulful too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low self esteem who is set up to be betrayed br br philip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and reginald denny the latter a friend of howard's br br although howard's performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland not vivian leigh has more consistency with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouse like secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch br br curiously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in 1934 leading to the largest write in campaign in it's history and a permanent change in it's rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous and in two years she co starred with howard again as equal stars in the petrified forrest
