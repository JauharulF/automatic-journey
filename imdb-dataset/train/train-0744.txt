<START> first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast candice bergen and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti war propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended merk jacobe comment above here's an idea why don't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films merk
<START> this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing
<START> rented it last night the opening 2001 ran waaaaaaaaay too long the hitchiker scene served no purpose some skits were just retarded i knew beforehand chevy chase was on for less than 2 minutes no problem here are the best parts br br koko uranus babs commercial curtis mayfield song br br total 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie br br everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell br br let me give you some advice if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies rent kentucky fried movie if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies rent amazon women on the moon or uhf br br otherwise don't bother renting this movie you'll save 2 3 dollars br br imho ken shapiro's best movie is still modern problems
<START> i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie witty writing some inside jokes i got others i didn't maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another great acting notably john cassini great cameos interesting and unique directing i rented it to see jeffrey meek very disappointed he was in it such a short time blink and you'll miss him but found the movie remarkably entertaining i'll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix i think actors and wanna be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie the ending is somewhat expected but wish they'd done something different and more positive too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the festival market i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen robin williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu even so his performance was still pitiful kurt russell was more believable but still was awful the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer which suckered me in to wasting 90 minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head br br do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it if not just be happy you don't
<START> a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war when a spanish republican sent by his soon to be overthrown government charles boyer infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain he upsets the locals getting convincingly beaten in one scene and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood notwithstanding socio economic hierarchy xenophobia and world politics this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe and manages more than once to get under your skin
<START> okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought the beginning started off fine for me it seemed to be heading in a decent direction got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that it had about 3 of these pointless scenes where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention thats where it got disturbing i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up but if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised
<START> this film has very tight and well planned dialogue acting and choreography br br recommended film for anyone who wants to see masterful writing and plot br br question does anyone know where the house is actually located it is one of the most interesting houses a 19thc windmill
<START> del you are the dumbest smart person i've ever met br br calvin well i had a brain but they lost it in the re writes br br i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov's work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here she's just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smith br br there are passing references to asimov's laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes br br smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn't that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do
<START> this movie was a mess it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream br br under the messy direction and editing there was a glimmer of something good a good idea a compelling spark but somewhere it went wrong br br the story is about a quasi psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy he always plays the crazy bad guy very ho hum br br oh a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character grieco was experiencing and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords not a good sign for any movie br br
<START> it's a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches it's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop motion animation it's weird but it's not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect it's the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrove hall did far more attractive things with stop motion br br interestingly this is a french production as such it re enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary
<START> quite possibly the nicest woman in show business and the sexiest debbie gives another fine performance here although her work in american nightmare was far superior she is still worth watching in this film br br the cast is filled with your typical melrose place types chiseled features and seductive curves that i had never seen before other than debbie laura nativo was the only actress i had seen before in the similar delta delta die br br the plot centers around a group of california arrogants who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique they tell her that they have a murder club and that she must kill someone to be accepted debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people so she quickly kills a person and now the group must decide what to do with her after she fell for their joke br br violence plentiful debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face gore hounds will surely enjoy br br nudity plentiful as well debbie rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no name actresses and actors the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked man and woman alike julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes br br story could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes i understand that b rate films use nudity often but this is borderline excessive br br acting the acting is sub standard to say the least rochon is always a treat easily the best b rate actress in the business today but her character in american nightmare was superior danny wolske does a fine job as debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about
<START> there's nothing particularly original about this story of corrupt unions on one side and the chief attorney on the other the stark but unimaginative lighting and photography stems from the fagged out noir cycle the story could easily have been out of a warner brothers drawer with george raft in the lead the performances are routine the direction flat and even the set dressing perfunctory an alley is shown by a single plaster wall of simulated brick it has one poster on it the poster says post no bills we are introduced to the story and some of the characters by a portentous narrator who informs us that while most unions work hard and honestly to advance the causes of their members a few are corrupt but we don't really get to know much about the unions or how they operate although i suppose they were fair game after the success of on the waterfront a few years earlier here they're just a peg to hang the tale on the real ring leader is a disbarred lawyer who runs things through three or four thugs the district attorney or whatever he is finds out like dana andrews did in boomerang that the wrong man dick foran is charged with a murder and he spends the rest of the film almost alone digging up evidence of foran's innocence he gets into fist fights and shoot outs like any inexpensive movie private eye br br brian keith is the d a he's shown some insinuating displays of talent elsewhere but here he spends most of the time speaking quietly and staring at the floor elisha cook jr is a likable rummy but can't do a good drunk beverley garland is okay but is undermined by the direction which has her gawking in a night club when she should be furtive the remainder of the cast would be suitable for a tv series br br and nobody is helped by the writing when a b girl is about to be shipped by the union mob to the filippines someone advises her that she only has to learn a few words of spanish i only know one word she says si yes the writers have not trusted the audience to know that si in spanish means yes the plot is clumsy and has holes in it keith visits a witness in her flat over a night club he enters the door and has a gun shoved in his back by a yegg but he outwits the heavy and knocks him out then the orders someone to call the police the rest of the scene played out at some length in the night club downstairs forgets all about the police and they never show up nor are they expected by anyone br br it's nothing to be ashamed of and some people might enjoy it but there is similar stuff better done elsewhere
<START> sammy horn michael des barres is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in california he has a lovely wife grace horn rosanna arquette who is pregnant and a beautiful son of about five years old sammy indeed loves his family but like dr jeckyll and mr hyde he has a double life having sex with many different women dr jane bordeaux nastassja kinski is trying to help him ok it is my fault i read the summary of the other imdb user comments i saw the imdb user rating but i really did not believe that rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski could participate in such a bad movie i decided to check it and actually some comments are very complacent the storyline the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some x rated movies we can find more intelligent stories the photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a vhs camcorder michael des barres does not have sense of ridiculous being an old man bald would be acceptable in an advertisement of viagra or grandfather of the small boy but as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman it is scary in wood allen's comedy maybe he got a chance but in a serious' movie it is funny i am trying to figure out why or how rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski accepted to participate in such awful amateurish and trash movie do they need money lack of chances in better movies due to their ages are they friends of the director' sorry for using this word and decided to help and promote him i do not know whether the intention of rosanna arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script the same is applicable to the gorgeous nastassja kinki she is presented fat without make up without any glamour a total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history a fact is really intriguing me how can a reader without any personal interest promote this trash giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie are they friends of the director' again i am using this word or the cast it sounds very strange to me that a normal imdb reader can like such a film my vote is two br br title brazil viciado em sexo' addicted in sex'
<START> raggedy ann and raggedy andy the movie is about dolls that come to life when the humans aren't around in this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named babette from the captain of pirates on their way they journey though deep dark woods taffy pit and even looney land will the aide of their new friend the camel with wrinkled knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him how will they escape the kookoo king and his henchmen what will their owner marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys delightful surprises await the two adventurers br br all scores are out of a possible 10 story 8 very cute dolls that come to life when the master isn't around not just that because they go out into many many different places but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen meeting new characters going to different places finding new friends its great the characters all work so well in this too and who doesn't love pirates acting 8 every character suits their voice so well specifically the marlon brando taffy pit enemy the greed the french doll has a very uptight french accent the evil hitler esquire king kookoo whos got hair that resembles simpson's sideshow bob plays his role very well and the sorrow old black man voice for camel works perfectly why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones music 10 nothing short of perfection here the songs have been in my head for years and re watching it nearly 20 years later i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from joe raposo of sesame street fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well br br editing 6 heh this is where it'll get confusing i mean how far did the raggedy's walk anyway a lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there's no telling who the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie but it does follow some sort of path and you know they'll eventually get to where they need to go its just pretty hard to follow at times br br uniqueness 8 between this and unico i'd have to say there's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to mainly the scary parts i've probably mentioned already how older movies were much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor outside of the south park movie and some disney films there's almost no animated musicals or good ones of that coming out so its very unique br br worth 8 its classic worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure but the vhs copies are probably all stretched out by now the dvd version is sold on ebay all the time and it'll definitely be something you'll watch more than once if anything get it for the nostalgia purposes br br overall score not an average 8 its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today its characters are all unique and the songs are great so great you might find yourself humming them time and time again give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today reviewer's insight including bias this isn't like the raggedy ann tv series made a decade later this was way more darker and real world the effects in this seem like a lot of other acid trip cartoons from the 70's in particular yellow submarine still its given me memories i'll never forget and might still influence things today it wasn't easy to find but it'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of dvds and videos forever
<START> this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped it didn't end it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment wow i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with
<START> spoilers below br br cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year that i've seen that is this movie is straight garbage there is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is this movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it the characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie you're just asking yourself why would you do that or what's your point in doing this this is how illogical and stupid the characters are we get no background into them so naturally you really don't give a rats as about their fate you could only laugh at their stupidity br br the 'slut' marcy for instance was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul rider strong there was no point in that its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ugh br br would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it first br br why didn't bert just shoot the sick guy from the start movie would've been over that way besides they ended up killing him anyway br br why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk 'no i'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally opt to walk outta there br br what was exactly the reasoning behind paul's attempt to fish out the body of the hermit only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus pure stupidity br br i swear common sense was not a friend much less an aquaintance to these idiots i don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for and he replied that 'its for the niggers' in the end of the film 3 young blacks dressed in baggy clothes one of them in a du rag no less go into the store come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting then he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys br br okay what the hell was the point of that how tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie i as a black man was of course offended by the initial 'nigger' comment it was a tasteless pointless remark my question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the black kids was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier to smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it well i for one did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit the whole movie was a joke a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day peter jackson really thought this film was that good what film was he looking at br br zero out of stars if i could give it a lower rating i would please fellow imdb'ers don't waste 1 1 2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie' this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> and a rather unexpected plot line too for the era there is plague in the city of new orleans and only richard widmark can stop it elia kazan's trademark subjects waterfronts working men crowds fugitives blue collar folk violence on a backstreet are all showcased here br br jack palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score zero mostel as dom delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go fer i enjoyed barbara bel geddes as the stalwart cool wife i thought she and widmark were a believable couple br br he himself always reminds me somewhat of sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything i'd never even heard of this movie and yes you have to admire widmark's performance i also enjoyed paul douglas he seemed to play this role many times they make an unlikely but effective team br br the plague itself is a mcguffin and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in real life rather small scale at the least no but i found it carried the plot along nicely br br check this out it's good outta
<START> let's put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980's because i for one don't think this is any better or any worse than the others unless your some religious kook or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and i personally had a totally innocuous feeling towards this before and after watching it story is set in albuquerque new mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named phillip philly fillmore eric brown is naturally horny as hell and starts spying on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father br br spoiler alert nicole mallow sylvia kristel is friendly to philly but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to flirt with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her undress philly is awkward and doesn't know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that nicole has died from a heart attack with the help from the sleazy chauffeur lester lewis howard hesseman they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a blackmailer shows up and philly must get 10 000 out of his father's safe philly is shocked when nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an extortion plan set up by lester and that she only went along with it because she's an illegal alien and if she didn't do what she was told lester would have called the immigration office together they try to get his father's money back before he returns home and they enlist the help from jack ed begley jr who is a tennis instructor but pretends to be a cop to scare lester br br this little comedy was made for less than 3 million but it grossed over 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which prompts me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre director alan myerson can boast that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television so why did this become so successful i have a thought that it just may be because of kristel and before you decide that i'm crazy listen to my reasoning kristel was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an american film that was getting a wide release with that the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of lovemaking by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film anyway that's my thought and if anyone has another reason i would love to hear it but back to the film itself it's apparent and very sad that a film like this could probably never get made again except in europe because of the religious right and the other prudish freaks who just can't come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm in fact it's a valuable service that all boys pray will happen to them the film itself is clumsy and kristel's body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their nipples the story although intriguing in it's basic form is neither very funny or revealing so were left ogling the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre
<START> sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lacking br br on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a season long reality drama dating show jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesn't just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancÃ© or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the women's actions the women are super competitive while they don't even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost br br not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women weren't there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses Â either low cut or short br br while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations br br so a reality dating show couldn't be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sex driven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someone's attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side br br another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i don't get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they don't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated br br michelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and we've only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show Â narrowly missing elimination Â and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminated br br it began with survivor and from there it just took off Â reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we weren't watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappings br br this begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds i'm not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each one br br episodes used for critique season premier and episode 2
