<START> in all my 60 years of age i have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification whether we want it or not implicit with an specific character br br sometimes because the character executes certain gesture sometimes because the character speaks determinate word or sentence Â that we use or that we would like to use Â in determinate situation br br the movie in question should be seen by this point of view who now find a parking space Â in a mall downtown or in the street taken by a car whose driver can't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world br br who hasn't the urge to rubber out the ill mannered spat br br haven said that i ask did you identify with della played by kim bassinger if your answer is yes then try not to find absurd details Â comparatively with life's reality Â in the movie because you'll certainly find the movie ridiculous br br abstractions made you will see that the movie has moments of surprise such as 1 in the sequence in which della grabs the box of tools in the trunk does that box contains a gun and does she haves the guts to use it 2 in the sequence in which terry dies whilst falling 3 in the sequence in which della gets attracted by chuckie's mermaid's call br br if you have already seen the movie or if are planning seeing keep in mind that there are realistic movies fiction movies political movies and movies in which you can wash your soul Â to exemplify the last one we can quote tropa de elite br br according to newspaper's there was unanimous applause when bope officials take certain attitudes as i have seen the movie in dvd i could not ascertain the audience's reaction Â br br as for the direction part susan monford interpretations kim bassinger lukas haas craig scheffer etc edition william m anderson Â 'dead poets society' 'green card' Â exceptional edition 'robocop 2' etc it is well situated in context in a scale of 1 awful to 10 master piece i rate when she was out a 7 regular
<START> new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je t'aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella
<START> i saw this many years after the television series and initially i didn't care for it then as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time i watched again and found it absolutely hilarious based on the stage play by neil simon it has not been 'opened out' much for the big screen and that's one of its strengths walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly john fielder as 'vinnie' even now certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter felix interrupting oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment the giggling 'pigeon sisters' brought low by felix's sob stories and of course the legendary cafeteria scene later ripped off by nora ephron's 'when harry met sally' razor sharp dialogue too when the boys think felix has taken an overdose oscar says they could be vitamins he could be the healthiest one in the room fantastic
<START> the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly the plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults but the dog is cute
<START> i can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear jerking for one it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes br br how can these families afford to maintain these new mega houses and what about their poor neighbors property taxes must surely increase after this happens plus the noise would annoy me br br second how excessive can a reality television show become it's practically the same repetitive junk week after week we're introduced to a suffering family they renovate the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the kleenex boxes br br not to mention how boring the renovation part is the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing br br extreme makeover home edition is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat skip this one if you like reality television survivor is far superior and moving
<START> sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 half good movie and won't do a film for less than 20 million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100 i give this film a mere 71
<START> the farrelly brothers bobby and peter are at it again with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen something that it would have been hard to do the novel of the same title dealt with a man's obsession with soccer since it is set in england where that sport consumes most of british sports fans it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans when they make their hero a boston red sox fan br br fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan ben wrightly whose life revolves into the red sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks a young woman who is going places but at thirty has no life of her own br br the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox at home games in fenway park this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but until 2004 never won a world series in fact the ending from what we heard had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera jimmy fallon a popular television comedian turned movie actor has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi in our humble opinion br br the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale
<START> i tried to finish this film three times but it's god awful case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast mom stops for gas crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the b b try to rape her she escapes heads to b b and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts wow br br other action logic deficits abound acting is also lukewarm and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted moment br br moments of intense gore death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time filler interplay between characters br br less focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated
<START> the ex mrs bradford 1936 starring thin man series star william powell this film was released the same year as the second thin man film after the thin man comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films but it nonetheless misses still it is a wonderfully fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein br br is myrna loy missed of course let's not lie however i'd be hard pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur and the chemistry between arthur and co star william powell is real and it's fun romantic and involving br br the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner james edward grant the angel the bad man is close to being up there with a thin man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle br br while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man movies what else is the ex mrs bradford is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery comedy who done its of the '30s 40s
<START> nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s as do her friends a group of writers singers and actors the Âfree love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system Â and nora didn't count on falling in love particularly with a junkie hazlehurst won her first of two afi awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of nora who makes sure she does the right thing by her children but falls in love with junkie javo friels at the same time garner Â who would later costar in films such as love and other catastrophes and strange planet Â is well cast as nora's pre pubescent daughter and caton perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program hot property in 2000 appears as a bearded painter early effort by director cameron is a winner he went on to make the award winning miniseries my brother jack among his later projects but it's the stunning delivery by hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent searching script based on helen garner's award winning novel
<START> i just finished watching guinea pig devils experiment i have to say that this movie although having very good fx better then i expected was not a good movie i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but i found it to be very boring and not as gory as i hoped and also i found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one i have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 flowers of the flesh and blood i wont say much more about devils experiment other than great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu ing torturers overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx cos they are awesome
<START> i found darkness to be just too dark it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go ugh but it was underlit to the point of confusion you don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film you already have all that nasty grain to deal with as with nathan schiff movies it's just too much director leif jonker seems to want to make an original film but he lacks the know how to do it the camera is never pointed in the right place lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy but despite these negatives the music is good the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances is this a classic like it says is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise no but it is a good first try now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished for a while and try again they may do better
<START> the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement it depicts a space gun launcher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future but it portrays a child like vision of boundless scientific technological investigation br br to me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government the pro progress characters such as the two cabals believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants br br arthur c clarke author of 2001 a space odyssey suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions source clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies it has a beautiful menzies art design but mediocre special effects esp the toy tanks br br i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness br br cabal too much rest and too soon and we call it death but for man no rest and no ending he must go on conquest beyond conquest this little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time still he will be beginning br br cabal if we are no more than animals we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass mattering no more than all the other animals do or have done he points out at the stars it is that or this all the universe or nothingness quotes from screenplay br br if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress then the council members of the world government will seem like technocrats but actually those technocrats allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they would have to be suppressed by government bans laws against science and experiment and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants br br in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress br br so it's also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it's about the wonders of progress many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias many want to ban cloning for example or naturalism some don't want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth or fear reason some believe we aren't ready for advanced science technology since we might destroy ourselves but cabal the president of the council has an answer to the problem of danger our scientific revolution did not abolish death or danger it simply made death and danger worth while screenplay
<START> far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank welker br br i'd love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them
<START> i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i don't really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull content topic and it's not really funny br br although the acting is generally good it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black don't show all their talent in this movie br br so if you're about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely don't go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it take a look at trivia
<START> i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series 'planet earth' narrated by david attenborough i found attenborough's narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth 'earth' is an easier movie it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his 'planet earth' series for instance earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that's an important difference that together with attanborough's far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too
<START> aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
<START> a strong pilot this two hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichÃ© candy colored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcan but the ensemble looks strong the characters are well drawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier later series scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer not just a glorified phone operator anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later which i hope happens because after about a half dozen episodes more variety will be needed
<START> i've had a lot of experience with women in russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately they are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair from the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal i've experienced it all in russia br br i know what i'm talking about and here are my qualifications here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met black comedy scams i was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv br br http www happierabroad com photojournals htm br br it's like reality tv you will love it i spent a ton of time putting it together so check it out the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals br br my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia however there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport it doesn't work that way at all so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way and i challenge anyone to find one that does the fact is you can only order the russian lady's contact info email address phone number etc from the website from there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your ins office and wait months after that that's how it works in real life you can't just order her to arrive at your airport us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen br br wumaster br br i got everything i wanted by going abroad you can too http www happierabroad com
<START> i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television scared the hell out of me but then i was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as i am now br br castle of blood aka danse macabre is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre along with mario bava's black sunday 1960 curse of the living dead aka kill baby kill 1966 and mario caiano's nightmare castle 1965 if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period br br i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan and scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years it adds a couple of minutes of dialog in french that don't really add much to the movie as whole but it's nice to see it complete without cuts unfortunately the dvd doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film br br one flub i noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door i guess the editors didn't catch it at the time or maybe they didn't care but it is something i didn't notice the first time that's the wonders of dvd you get to see all the flubs mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around but no matter br br but no matter it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter br br
