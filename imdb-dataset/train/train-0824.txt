<START> this is a brilliant sci fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots but whatever the cause i have always found this difference fascinating br br the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated as the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy including furniture a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment at the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed br br why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discuss it could ruin the film for you however the film has a great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch plus it features edward g robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great sci fi film that is allegorical and profound
<START> rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldn't have been the same dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new crap but the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do r i p rest in peace joey ramone 1951 2001 dee dee ramone 1952 2002
<START> when i read most of the other comments i felt they were way too glowing for this movie i found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen it's often best to just let things be i completely agreed with the star trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the first star trek movie to the original series millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original br br the plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory though the recent new zatoichi by beat takeshi is much bloodier and lacks the heart of the originals i didn't mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads in addition time has not been good to ichi he seems a broken and sad man in this film much much more than usual and that's something fans of the series may not really want to see br br this was a very sorry return for zatoichi unless you are like me and want to see every zatoichi film this one is very skipable see one of the earlier versions or the 2003 all new version
<START> in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however it's also so bent on being realistic it's sometimes more clinical than entertaining recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family author truman capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were they're not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall
<START> 1 out of 10 br br this is the kind of movie that you cant believe you just wasted 2 hours of your life as you see the credits role i honestly think i could make a better vampire movie and i know nothing the only thing that does not just suck harder than a vampire is jason scott lee his character is at least a little bit cool has some mystery and kicks a little butt
<START> please someone stop ben stiller from acting in any movie write the studios hell write your local congressman even i've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then i have watching any stiller flick jack black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap and christopher walken perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation simply looks embarrassed to be there stiller is his unfunny self but now even with someone to bail him out proves that he is way overrated as a comic it's no wonder why this movie tanked badly and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks i warn you and you must warn your friends do not watch this flick it is just awful worst then gothika personally i'd never thought i'd say that worst the plan 9 worst the ishtar worst then the golden child please hollywood quit allowing ben stiller in your movies he's not funny he's a god awful actor and he's bringing others down with him the following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed so while the board says one i'll give it a zero
<START> ironically for a play unavailable on film or video for so long arms and the man has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894 in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the business of war whenever the world sinks into strife arms and the man seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant br br this is the play which oscar strauss converted leaving out most of shaw's best ideas into the successful operetta the chocolate soldier when hollywood got to that they left out the last vestiges of shaw rather than pay him for the rights he was by then an oscar winner in his own right while the best of shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots in arms and the man the plot sparkles as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned br br young raina helena bonham carter daughter of an officer and the wealthiest man in her town is betrothed to a dashing officer in the bulgarian cavalry and all seems well until a bedraggled swiss mercenary pip torrens from the other side climbs up her drainpipe fleeing from the battle where his army has been routed as usual in a shaw satire nothing is as it first appears and societal conventions are stood on their head in the light of simple and not so simple reason there are no good guys or bad guys just people of a variety of classes getting by on the best of their wits just like life only better and naturally with shaw the wit is finely honed from all concerned br br the early 1932 motion picture version from shaw's own screenplay of this most traditional and traditionally funny of shaw's stage satires and one of his first to make a real hit on this side of the atlantic has long been among the missing shaw didn't sell the screen rights to his plays only licensed them for 5 year periods and it appeared that with rapidly evolving sound technology making 1932 films look primitive only a few years later shaw did not renew the license to show it consequently we're immensely in the bbc's debt for finally putting out their 1987 broadcast version in a dvd box with nine other sparkling plays somewhat sadly pygmalion that many view as shaw's best comes off least well on this set in a production with lynn redgrave and james villiers br br even paired as it is on its dvd with the less impressive one act a man of destiny arms and the man makes for a real treasure br br helena bonham carter went on after cutting her teeth on televised roles like this to a major film career that will bring many viewers to this early role they should not be disappointed for ms carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her but under james cellan jones' somewhat pedestrian direction and despite the bbc's uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production the role's mischievous fire and her outrage at being underestimated in the last act is banked at only about 80 of it's potential br br much the same can be said of the real star of the piece pip torrens as bluntschli the switzer it's a fine appealing performance but doesn't go for the physical comedy implicit in the early scene where the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal peril br br these reservations notwithstanding this is a solid production of a wonderful play transferred to the small screen with aplomb it deserves to be seen widely and ideally prompt an even livelier big screen remake with the style and zest of the recent remake of wilde's an ideal husband virtually any arms and the man is to be cherished and with a lot of luck perhaps we'll even eventually get to see the original 1932 version 'till one or the other surfaces this production will please anyone who loves good shaw
<START> the shop around the corner is one of the sweetest and most feel good romantic comedies ever made there's just no getting around that and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words it's not one of those films that tries too hard nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end in fact all its charm is innate contained within the characters and the setting and the plot which is highly believable to boot it's easy to think that such a love story as beautiful as any other ever told could happen to you a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies however sweet and heart warming they may be br br alfred kralik james stewart and clara novak margaret sullavan don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop matuschek co he's been working in for the past nine years asking for a job they clash from the very beginning mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened he thinks it's a ludicrous idea she makes one big sell of it and gets hired their bickering takes them through the next six months even as they both unconsciously of course fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through po box 237 this would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on except that the shop around the corner is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters from the fatherly but lonely hugo matuschek frank morgan himself who learns that his shop really is his home pirovitch felix bressart kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion smarmy pimp du jour vadas joseph schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous kralik and ambitious errand boy pepi katona william tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for matuschek co the unpretentious love story between 'dear friends' is played out in this little shop in budapest hungary in which kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds to be along it's nice that everyone gets a story in this film the supporting characters are well developed and matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one alfred and clara share his invitation to new errand boy rudy charles smith for christmas eve dinner made in the whirling beautiful snow of a hungarian winter makes the audience glad that he is not alone we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell br br aside from the love story i must say that james stewart is truly one of the best things about this film he doesn't play the full fledged jimmy stewart persona in this film c f 'mr smith goes to washington' for that in fact alfred kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind he's rather a brusque man in fact with little hint until perhaps the very end of the aw shucks down home boyish charm stewart would soon come to patent when he finds out before clara that they have been corresponding in secret in fact kralik doesn't 'fess up he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself his description to clara of the fictional matthias popkin what a name who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever clara insults mr kralik as she is often wont to do even and especially to his face and yet one believes underneath the brusqueness and professionalism that he could reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does br br special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well margaret sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on christmas eve when she almost gets her heart broken again by alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart frank morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous hugo matuschek driven to nervous breakdown the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him' and felix bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal pirovitch wonderfully a lubitsch regular since he appears as a hilarious russian ambassador in ninotchka of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend alfred get the christmas present the latter really wants a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box clara is so hung up on br br ernst lubitsch really does himself proud with this film for example the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the matuschek shop is well worth the effort right down to the hungarian names on the door the wares and the cash register and so on but even though lubitsch chose to have the story set in hungary the setting is actually universal it could happen anywhere it could happen to you therein lies the charm of this simple story these believable characters who really are people the snow on christmas eve is real as well or at least as real as lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated no not even in a remake like you've got mail br br this is really the jimmy stewart christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about it's a wonderful life not to detract from the merits of that other film but there'd be no harm and in fact a lot of good done in watching the shop around the corner this christmas instead it's sweet funny charming and stewart is impeccable in his role we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could
<START> i recently bought the dvd forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of a chorus line every change the director attenborough made to the story failed br br by making the director cassie relationship so prominent the entire ensemble premise of the musical sails out the window br br some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed the show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie's character br br the overall staging is very self conscious br br the only reason i give it a 2 is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it
<START> not sure if it was right or wrong but i read thru the other comments before watching the short i have to say i disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it br br as a first time lone wolf director producer i like to see things that i can aspire to not necessarily from the pro's but by people just getting their feet wet like me br br if indeed this is also from a first timer as i read i applaud the effort marvelous job then in that respect there were some comments about the music i thought it was quite nice for the piece some say it kind of droned along for a while but i found that created tension without us necessarily being conscious of it and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chords it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks but realize it is just now moving yes there is a 180 degree slip clip in there but shi happens did anyone else see hugh's dirty shirt turn white near the end in the rain in australia look how much money and people were behind that movie give the kid a break for gods sake all in all i think it was very well done only 2 things i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning don't walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is br br my experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie it just takes time to learn how to do it then the time to actually do it and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you'll need to have shot before you call post production time imho it looks like director writer ryan jafri did his homework and if this indeed is his first report card i'd give him an a the rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin'
<START> this is one of the best made movies from 2002 maybe it is not the best movie but it looks the best has great acting and is directed perfectly by sam mendes who debuted with 'american beauty' br br it tells the story of a gangster named michael sullivan tom hanks who is seen by his son tyler hoechlin on one of his jobs michael's boss john rooney paul newman thinks things will be okay but his jealous son connor rooney daniel craig sets both his father and michael up leading to the death of michael's wife jennifer jason leigh and second son michael thinks rooney is responsible and rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit man harlen maguire jude law to finish the job since michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss frank nitti stanley tucci br br in a way 'road to perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that this movie is good in its production design art direction sound music and most of all in its cinematography all these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain that hoechlin is not a annoying kid and hanks law and newman know how to act helps of course br br based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time the scenes between the adult hanks and the child hoechlin help in that area see this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas
<START> i saw jack frost for Â£4 00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover br br the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only axed you for a smoke and worlds most pi ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be nimble jack be quick jack gouged eyes with candle sticks if you're looking for a for a b movie comedy horror that's full of puns then check jack frost out 10 10
<START> elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast you'd sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor it's not just the age difference but i just can't see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss leigh's deteriorating mental condition though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesn't even seem to try using an accent br br the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to finch's tea plantation in ceylon sri lanka and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her on top of that once back home finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her however taylor isn't yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave when out of the blue cholera strikes the plantation so it's up to andrews finch and taylor to work together to save the day though by this point i really didn't care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you can't understand why taylor didn't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell br br the film isn't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a sluggish mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasn't integrated well in one scene for instance taylor finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown it's clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget it's just not a very good or inspired film br br by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning she's wearing billowy clothes has a double chin and looks puffy this isn't a criticism after all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully you'll see what i mean br br also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant a great taylor film indeed it's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much
<START> this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was while it was an answer it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2 br br the problem really became reality got lost on this show for example in one episode johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick amazingly by the end of the show johnny had healed entirely along with that the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley br br this is a show that i would not want dvds of frankly hope they are never released think since cbs was running out of lots they re used many familiar settings this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's
<START> oh my god this movie insults the intelligence of everybody i mean really who thinks three kids can fight 30 to 40 ninjas and win not to mention the brainless humor thrown in this film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad the movie is an omen the only thing it's good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs
<START> in this strangely lackadaisical apocalypse the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it the plot and i use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested anyone older beware
<START> nell shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in 'back to god's country' of the previous year and she failed miserably this time she does better although it seems pointless 'something new' hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase there's a brief premise which sets up the hero co author and shipman's boyfriend to have to save the girl played by shipman then it's nothing but an exciting implausible chase from there of course it plays out like an hour long advertisement for a maxwell sedan but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous it doesn't seem that she learned much from the last minute rescue films of d w griffith or its parodies by mack sennett and other comedians which she's imitating br br one point of interest is that shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story which has as its protagonist a writer shipman again although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it even though she attempts to again others had pioneered the writer's joke in the intertitles like anita loos with 'wild and woolly' or frances marion with 'a girl's folly' both 1917 at least shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously and neither do i 'something new ' despite its claim is hackneyed
<START> maybe you shouldn't compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that's nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture you're wrong it's overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mc's jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and that's alright but as far as i'm concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten
<START> from the star of mitchell from the director of joysticks and angel's revenge these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ugghhh joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film it's like a bad remake of coogan's bluff
<START> the 1960's tv series bewitched owes it's idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating br br this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs the movie has a lot of good things about it hermine gingold is very good in this movie almost as good in support here as she was in the music man the cast is very solid br br this movie has a late 1950's new york city feel a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any a little magic too boot br br it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved sure am glad that william asher saw it so that the 1960's series got created i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen this movie is much better than that
