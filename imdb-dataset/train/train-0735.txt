<START> i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished br br i am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community
<START> this show is totally worth watching it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time the premise of the show is unique and fresh i guess the executives at abc are not used too that as it was not another reality show however this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines i am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show as i am in my forty's but a lot of my friends also loved it late 30's mid 40's and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members i do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience i believe that given more time this show would have done very well once again abc is not giving a show with real potential a real chance with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it they need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode i have been watching the episodes on abc videos and the show keeps getting better and better although i think they owe us one more episode number 13 we want to watch what we can bombard abc with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction it certainly worked for jerico some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them sign the online petition to abc at http www petitiononline com gh1215 petition html
<START> this 1939 film from director john ford and writer lamar trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer abraham lincoln his trials literally and his tribulations it's a sentimental film reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking the casting of henry fonda as lincoln seems a mistake for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for honest abe who was famously homely it's a good try from fonda who's nothing if not sincere but his miscasting throws the entire film off the supporting cast is excellent though and includes alice brady ward bond and donald meek but ford is too reverential in his treatment of lincoln who is presented as just shy of a saint and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top
<START> this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren however alex karzis is awful as the villain the story is very good and i found the kids to be likable for the most part plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this the action scenes are excellent and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school plus kata dobÃ³ is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick the finale is very exciting and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well however i just wished it had another villain because alex karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too ott and laughable for my tastes this should be higher then 4 1 in my opinion as i thought it was a great action film and while the kids were very stupid at times they got quite resourceful as the movie went along plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well the ending is very amusing and corey sevier's character was my favorite student plus dolph has still got it this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from lundgren but alex karzis is awful as the villain still i highly recommend this one the direction is very good sidney j furie does a very good job here with great camera work good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace there is a bit of blood and violence we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds knife in the side of the head bloody arrow hits an impaling and other minor stuff the acting is fantastic dolph lundgren is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable kicks that ass as usual had great chemistry with the kids had an awesome character is very charismatic and he may not have shown a great emotional rage he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch he is one of my favorite actors lundgren rules alex karzis is god awful as the villain he is laughably ott was boring and not menacing at all he also annoyed the crap out of me kata dobÃ³ is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do she was the real villain in my opinion corey sevier is funny as mick he was my favorite student and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half i liked him a lot he had good chemistry with dolph too dov tiefenbach willy chris collins hogie mpho koaho jay tee danielle hampton alicia nicole dicker charlee all do great as the students jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancÃ©e rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn't considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower br br bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues don't they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan gosling br br the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually he'd be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run br br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn't redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there's nothing to see here people move along keep moving
<START> it ran from 1959 1973 its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's br br i remember repeats of this series it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories cast and productions that made it exceptional lorne green had his defining iconic character from this series its appeal was across generations all members of the family could enjoy this it balanced morality with violence humour with seriousness a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance
<START> i have read modesty blaise for several years now collecting numbers of the strip after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book modesty blaise i was surprised the result got this good br br what i got was a movie not based on action or violence the director had focused on history and psychology how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non childhood i think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next i hope film i simply loved the movies old fashioned style br br however everything wasn't that good the gambling wasn't that good almost boring and unreal the acting could have been improved too i'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for also they could have expanded the movie showing more about when she builds up the network but i'll guess thats for the next movie br br and please forgive me for my bad english
<START> this thing is horrible the ben affleck character is self centered and gleefully sadistic punch you in the nose fratboy sadistic and he's the romantic hero his cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness br br if i were a socialist i would screed beyond belief but i'm not a socialist br br we capitalists like a little christmas magic from time to time this ain't magic i don't know what it is it's just awful and it's a horrible waste of talent o'hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s gandolfini applegate these people were all underused if ben was out of the equation these folks might have dreamed up something excellent
<START> the idea was awesome the actors were incredible the story could of been very scary but the writing was poor and there was no depth i couldn't really get into this movie i couldn't feel for the characters there were a lot of cliffhangers and the movie just ends very weirdly was it a happy ending i don't know was it a sad ending again i don't know you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied the movie had so much to give but couldn't just because you can edit doesn't mean you should right i wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed you'll just be confused trust me you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie br br 3 10
<START> this is a rotten movie the cast seem to know just how bad it was it starts badly and by the end is truly bad the acting is woeful the script could of been written on the spot and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes crap 1 out of 10
<START> why didn't this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft filmed performed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screen the pan scan really kills this film's wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branagh's passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as hamlet's murderous uncle he doesn't play him as a mustache curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlet's fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into branagh's vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece
<START> this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor the film itself just wasn't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasn't even a consideration in particular i really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated such as when the characters talked to her they usually said clara barton instead of ma'am miss barton or clara plus one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a johnny reb a confederate a rebel almost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls this was just sloppy writing period br br it was interesting to see john hamilton later perry white on the superman tv show in a beard as president garfield yep it's him under that beard
<START> how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory st hf will be glad to show you br br if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show do not watch this br br the writing is hodge podge the actors' portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggy br br like watching strong captains don't look here like the strong federation attitude forget about it here starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hair br br while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer it just degrades from there no not even uniforms match for goodness sake they are too small or too big collars down to their chests and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and ds9 uniforms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads the only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season ok i take that back who uses cg that inexpertly the designers of this show br br don't bother with it it will offend your star trek sense as it did mine not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe br br i wept openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured that bad
<START> if utterly facile regressive self indulgent anti establishment anti civilisation juvenilia appeals to you then this is the ideal film very poorly scripted with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand held camera throughout this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic manichean terms all adults especially teachers parents priests and doctors are insensitive and bumbling at best and predatory monsters at worst the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming yawn and infantile regression literally in a primitive cave like space in the woods with utopia taking the form of a rave party again in the woods naturally displays all the weaknesses of a first film and plenty more besides
<START> 49 paperhouse thriller horror 1988 sick in bed with a fever 11 year old anna charlotte burke has only her drawings to keep her company her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious 'black outs' grip her in each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field with only a sickly invalid boy named marc elliot spiers inhabiting it when a dark unknown danger threatens her idyllic paperhouse the life of marc is put in jeopardy her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health br br critique haunting first debut feature from british director bernard rose taken from a fable marianne dreams by catherine storr it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form director rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them br br feverishly scored by phillip glass rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed 'jump out of your seat' moments most thrillers are very sloppy in this all important aspect of scaring the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring i also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or falter sluggishly into the next sequence of events also his mastery of placing objects within the frame as in his p o v shots gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack only in europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here the lonely house the fields coastal towns watchtower etc br br rose would follow this film with candyman 1992 a true 'thinking person's' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite
<START> wow rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately but this one especially is begging for a beatdown let's start at the beginning first writer director susan montford puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable br br when she goes out for some christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night della is furious that somebody double parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year she decides to do something about it so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall when she finally gets to her car the thugs confront her about the note a cop is killed and she runs and they catch up to her and she gets away and they chase her some more and on and on everything is completely predictable and uninvolving the thugs are not scary or menacing at all and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways br br this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me and once just once in a film like this does the leader of the pack have to die last what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept much of the movie simply consists of lukas haas running around in the woods screaming della and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting br br the part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when della exhausted and hurt cries out to the heavens where are you god where indeed was god when this movie was being made i give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting and it's not as bad as 'btk killer ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film cheers
<START> not even goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction this is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say the scientists gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers psychologists and psychiatrists would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro surgery the field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support gores alarmist claims of global warming as one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming my analysis of this movie and gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant no more no less ask any global warming alarmist or journalist one simple question you say global warming is a major problem tell me what temperature is the earth supposed to be
<START> this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others there are the usual ingredients it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet t shirt contests quite frequently the story is just laughably idiotic and the film takes itself much too seriously and then orang utans in africa br br but it has a few things going for it bo looks great the production values sets costumes etc are quite good and this greatly enhances its camp value in a strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly
<START> it is projected that between 2000 and 2020 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of aids the projected toll is greatest in sub saharan africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about christophe honorÃ© describes one of the most moving in close to leo a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people though fictional it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common the effect of a diagnosis of hiv on a loving close knit family br br when twenty one year old leo pierre mignard tells his parents and two teenage brothers tristan rodolphe pauley and pierrot jeremie lippmann that he has aids the family is devastated out of concern for his youth they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother 12 year old marcel yannis lespert but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically when leo goes to paris for treatment he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends however tension between them boils to the surface setting the stage for a riveting conclusion br br although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by lespert and mignard more than tip the scales in its favor seeing events unfold from the young boy's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the quebecois film leolo and truffaut's the 400 blows unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real
<START> i have nothing more to say but it was awful i cannot imagine why helen mirren and others were part of this degrading mess and if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films there was at least one seen that left me curious just my opinion shudder to think what was going on that was cut from the film shudder to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind like i stated before its a degrading mess its not even funny as ebert said of the film caligula with malcolm mcdowell its not a good film not a good story and its not even good porn yeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
