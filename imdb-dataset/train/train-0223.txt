<START> tim meadows has to be the most underrated of snl's recent cast members what initially was a low brow look at a sleazy gigilo develops into a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute run albeit still low brow don't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or oscar worthy performances walk into it expecting brilliant silliness with tim meadows and will ferrell doing what they do best making the audience laugh br br leon the ladies' man phelps is a naive likable radio sex show host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the wang as a gifted ladies man he lays waste to the wives of countless saps who've banded together in order to hunt him down the director does an inspired job of guiding the actors on a comedic tryst which makes up completely for the lack of plot development how much plot would one expect from an snl skit while some scenes are a little off the mark for the most part meadows' one liners and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone squarely for instance in one scene meadows compares himself to mother theresa but for bonin' sure it's crass but don't we all in the privacy of our homes get a chuckle out of his advice to an entire city for doin' it in the butt in another scene immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead he suddenly remembers the name of his would be benefactor a woman he slept with years ago he stands up in front of the woman who's obviously fallen for him and proclaims that the ladies' man is back to her obvious chagrin br br billy dee williams hits the ball out of the park as the bartender narrator will ferrell the repressed homosexual rounds out solid performances br br see this movie if you're into adult humor if not stay away with extreme prejudice
<START> not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young man john cusack and a drop dead gorgeous woman kate beckinsale keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere a little sappy in some places but viva la love being a romantic i am almost obligated to be riveted my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling the finale is almost too sweet but most deserving this is not one of cusack's deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale notable support is provided by jeremy piven and molly shannon john corbett plays the worst role i've ever seen him in on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny watch this with your soul mate
<START> i don't see how this show is like the oc at all br br first of all the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time second the oc takes place in california north shore takes place in hawaii br br and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part it has a good storyline and plot i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out it wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows br br i hope fox keeps it on the air
<START> i am watching this movie right now on wtn because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister's wife alexandra paul falling in lust with a young stud drifter with washboard abs played by corey sevier there may or may not be a plot corey whips his shirt off a lot and alexandra swoons i'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good and that's why he's messing with skinny alexandra paul it's not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage there's a lot of sax on the soundtrack which is just painful
<START> a delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light hearted performers' vehicle bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare some people feel that all film must be important if you share those views don't bother the credits read introducing angelina jolie which is not even close to being true but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character and as always her acting is wonderful and considering her age at the time even her dialect is pretty good recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud
<START> in fact these young people were so distasteful that i couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered and that includes clarissa joanna canton since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch br br but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background it had nowhere to go but down br br even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing i'm sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since it'll appeal to that bunch it sure didn't appeal to me blah br br and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still looks hot though i'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays br br however it is a step up from dante tomaselli's meandering horror 2002 in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so i'll give it that much that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film br br lion's gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up br br 2 out of 10
<START> tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kelly's clichÃ©d patchy overwrought screenplay domino harvey kiera knightley was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter this is her story sort of br br the problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in harvey's chaotic life br br you just don't care about harvey knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect she punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it but she isn't the least bit real and knightly isn't the least bit convincing either br br the film is boring it's loud too and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores i've heard in a long time the final twenty minutes are a poor re run of scott's true romance climax with domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are surprise surprise destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a las vegas casino br br unfortunately this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation this is not an artistically brave or experimental piece it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters br br mickey roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses chris walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and dabney coleman always solid is underutilized br br don't be fooled by this film's multi layered gimmick ridden surface it is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it
<START> this may not be war peace but the two academy noms wouldn't have been forthcoming if it weren't for the genius of james wong howe br br this is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not bb c is a visual feast br br i'm not saying it's his best work i'm no expert there for sure but the look of this movie is amazing i love everything about it elsa lanchester the cat the crazy hoo doo the retro downtown ness but the way it was put on film is breathtaking br br i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above and the special effects that seem backward now it all creates a really consistent world
<START> richard dix decided to retire and so michael duane took his place playing the role as ted nichols who meets up with a young french girl named alice dupres barkley lenore aubert this couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a justice of the peace judge and it is pouring rain when they pull up to the judge's home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day as the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an automobile part from the engine once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which surrounds alice barkley and so poor ted nichols starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage good mystery but i missed richard dix enjoy
<START> actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray little richard than leon he captures little richard to a most believable essence the outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie although the movie is a little long it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of little richard in mind the ending should have taken a direction of moving little richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium he will always be the king of rock n roll as far as i am concerned regardless of what the other media says
<START> a real head scratcher of a film by bill rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given 1 million provided he or she makes it that far a series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of american bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers if there was any hesitation that white people can't dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin pay close attention for the nipple slip this continues on for about forty five minutes until bill rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess it's a game until it's not a game the three old coots are in complete control until they're not the hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props they're dead until they're not even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened i defy anyone to reason where rebane was going on this one the acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local stuckey's i give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself let's see gone with the wind do that this chilling classics collection is really becoming the bane of me bane get it like rebane i hate myself
<START> a very gritty gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history that most of us in the u s had have no idea ever occurred i would love to have this on video it only was shown on t v one time as far as i know back in 89or 90 i have asked around for this movie and most video stores don't even know about it great actresses all around wish that i could see it again top notch series
<START> well jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay but although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion i am an atheist it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end why is this movie so incredibly boring i don't know it just is and so it is not recommendable
<START> i voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws other than that this movie is one of my favorites it's entertaining to say the least the shooting scenes are ridiculous though and i think gackt who wrote the book takes a little bit too much of his matrix obsession into it it seems like their enemies just stands there waiting to get shot at however this movie is touching and it always makes me cry it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well gackt is a superb actor i must say he shows so much emotion this was hyde's first time acting and he did okay the role fits him wang lee hom is absolutely great the whole cast is what i would say perfect for this movie don't miss it you'll regret it
<START> in frank sinatra's first three films he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie in his fourth film the very enjoyable 'higher and higher' young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers br br sinatra's entrance is quite funny michele morgan hears a knock at the door and asks who's there from outside a hoboken toned voice answers 'frank sinatra' sure enough br br the opening credits of 'higher and higher' may confuse some viewers as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed in fact they only contributed one song to this musical 'disgustingly rich' which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song 'i'm a debutante' interestingly that rodgers hart song one of their weakest is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score several others are lively up tempo numbers notably 'it's a most important affair' 'when it comes to love you're on your own' and 'i saw you first' br br sinatra's good in this movie but he would do better work and sing better material elsewhere the real merits of 'higher and higher' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material here grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul's hands grace hartman who died of cancer at age 48 did almost no film work so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close up to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform after grace hartman's death her husband had a long career as a character actor just occasionally dancing solo or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of 'mayberry rfd' br br also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in 'higher and higher' is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire why didn't this talented girl make more movies perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton i enjoy hutton's performances but i like marcy mcguire even better near the end of 'higher and higher' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious regrettably although leon errol plays a large role in 'higher and higher' he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubber legged dance jack haley despite his prominent billing is also wasted br br very well represented here is dooley wilson inevitably remembered as sam from 'casablanca' in that film wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of 'as time goes by' in real life wilson couldn't play piano here in 'higher and higher' he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel odious i mean mel torme victor borge gives a rare film performance here handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows br br the plot forget it 'higher and higher' is nobody's idea of a 'great' musical but it's an enjoyable delight and i'll rate it 8 out of 10 director tim whelan who worked in britain as well as in hollywood deserves to be much better known
<START> the thing about my folks came in as a surprise we had no idea about what to expect the film directed by raymond defelitta and based on a screen play by one of its stars paul reiser proved to be a pleasant time at the movies although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father perhaps for the first time in his life ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in his mind br br the film seems to be a vehicle for its star peter falk and he runs away with the movie as it was expected mr falk one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years is an actor of such stature he must be reckoned with as sam kleinman the distant father to ben he is a man that clearly is misunderstood not only by ben but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty seven years br br when muriel the matriarch of the kleinman clan runs away everyone goes into a panic because this woman who has been the strong figure of the family is vital to keep everyone together not knowing where she has gone sam shows up at ben's house confused as he feels abandoned suddenly by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years br br ben the youngest son takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son along the way father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children the love of sam for muriel spans the many years they have known one another they seem inseparable br br peter falk is magnificent in the film he makes an excellent sam kleinman the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst mr falk shines as the older man and there's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him br br not being a paul reiser fan we must confess that as ben kleinman he is right ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother elizabeth perkins plays rachel with great style br br the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan gillham and the excellent musical score by steven argila ultimately the film shows a great team effort between its director mr defelitta and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen br br although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience it should please anyone
<START> story goes like this netflix was late sending me my dvds so i went on down to the the analog rental place known as blockbuster video they suck you know real bad they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet i never want to see any of those so i saw btk killer there on the shelf all by its lonesome self i like seeing films based on serial killers its just a part of humanity that i will never understand therefore i wanna see that kind of stuff anyways i put this dvd in and all the sudden from the very first second it sucks i'm sitting there with my b f and we are like what is this kind of crap unsteady camera operation horrible acting the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead then a rat gets stuffed down her throat i really wonder if the director has a hard on for this crap there is nothing decent about this film all i have to say to the director is do you own a freakin' tripod every shot was brutally unstable the music was awful it was like they just decided one day to make a movie they were probably gathering people from walmart to show up and act for them just plain awful if you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby not what you should be doing for a living should not make it to the dvd renal outlets for movie buffs like myself better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with then you break out your btk killer film and say wanna see this crappy movie i did once
<START> if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flick br br i don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh it ain't shakespeare but it is well done ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one better than any episode of baywatch and shows a knack for subtle humor too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that br br tom berenger fits his role of real navy perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler br br throw in a walk on by hopper in the middle of the chase for the cherry on this sundae and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing i bought this one as soon as it was available br br brain candy
<START> john carpenter's halloween br br is it the greatest horror film of all time no maybe not to everyone but to me it is and always will be the film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart br br it's unfortunate i didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then my father suggested before i go see halloween h20 that i whip out and rent halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story and after watching halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the slasher genre br br the film's plot is simple in 1963 michael audrey myers killed his sister judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by dr sam loomis he escapes and returns to his hometown of haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls laurie strode an innocent bookworm annie brackett a tough talking sarcastic and lynda van der klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl dr loomis tracks michael here where he enlists the help of the town sheriff leigh brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one until only sweet innocent laurie is left who is the prime target on michael's list br br the casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances jamie lee curtis was stunning in her first film role as laurie strode and donald pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as loomis nick castle who portrays michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer and his walk and body movements were perfect br br one of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by john carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today the blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends and in the shadows behind her michael's face materializes before he strikes michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most the white emotionless face worked perfectly br br what makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy friday the 13th films in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension br br it became so clear that halloween spawned movies like friday the 13th and characters like jason voorhees whom he is a mere rip off of michael myers br br to sum it up i suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time
<START> i was 16 when i first saw the movie and it has always been a huge favorite of mine of course you can't deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie how fine is that man sheesh he still is he's the bad boy every woman secretly wants his acting is flawless he played a drunk druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could and he had in '76 he finally got on the wagon so it was all very real br br the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense i think it's more a problem for male viewers than female us gals are just looking at kris and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest my husband cannot watch the movie b c of her he doesn't like her looks but i did make him sit through just the red ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting you should have seen it on my 50 plasma wow and lastly the transfer quality was great anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film br br brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together i bought a copy for her for christmas would have loved to watch it together with her last night br br i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland but i guess seeing this one first i just can't get into the earlier era watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what i was living at the time br br i am working my way through the commentary by streisand but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie her voice sounds exactly the same now as then br br check it out if you grew up in the same era as me born in 1960 you will love it br br wendy
