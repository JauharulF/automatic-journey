<START> i'm really tempted to reward the case of the scorpion's tail with a solid 10 out of 10 rating but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970's is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere blood soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martino's finest giallo and that has got to mean something as the strange vice of mrs wardh all the colors of the dark torso and your vice is a locked room and only i have the key are all top notch genre achievements as well but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control following her husband's peculiar death in a plane explosion lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she's eager to leave the country as soon as possible due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece there lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the case's mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money i'm always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i don't want to risk giving away essential plot elements in the case of the scorpion's tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and i certainly don't want to ruin this for you many red herrings follow after that but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a 100 satisfying the denouement is at least surprising it's also a very stylish film with imaginative camera work and excellent music by bruno nicolai everyone' s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didn't make it to this cast she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli but anita strindberg lizard in a woman's skin who saw her die is a more than worthy replacement for her the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and Â duh Â ladies' man deluxe if you're a fan of giallo don't wait as long as i did to watch this film
<START> first of all we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far and counting the story begins in the not so far future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story about that movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves cause its pretty good as far as the direction goes it is prefect movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better so if you are getting ready to see a sci fi movie or some action you'll miss it b there should be more movies like this
<START> i guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of beauty and the beast but i can't say i've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex wow anyway it seems that a young woman and her aunt have traveled to this castle in france where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off it seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather uh frisky i guess you could say with the ladies or at least one in particular there are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon to be blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom's father removes it from her sight anyway the young bride to be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding a family member i guess and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her the effects in this leave a little to be desired and any attempt at eroticism not that i know much about that is kind of rendered laughable especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat this has a rather strange and abrupt yet twist ending with not really any clues or much build up to it but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected i don't know this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird 7 out of 10
<START> where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well br br a copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past but towards the end he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed br br the cast includes dana andrews while the city sleeps curse of the demon gene tierney laura the ghost and mrs muir gary merrill mysterious island karl malden the streets of san francisco beyond the posidon adventure and craig stevens the deadly mantis good parts from all br br where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out if you get the chance excellent br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like i've been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion cash's narration is good too br br but br br 1 the actor who played jesus was miscast 2 there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music 3 because it is uncompelling i doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again br br i'd love to buy the cd br br tom paine texas usa
<START> i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words clueless and appalling nonsense i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart warmed is it so impossible there are far more implausible events described in other movies the acting is good the script is funny the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality
<START> this is almost typical lynch however what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw almost amateurish but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments br br however a lot of typical lynch motifs are present such as floating camera work haunting music long excruciating pauses hanging curtains dim lights growing darker at a slow almost indiscernible pace extreme close ups themes of women in trouble over bearing incompassionate all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught temporarily oblivious in the dark and so on br br the performances are great and the short is thought provoking as usual lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination br br another brilliant effort from lynch i only hope he makes some shorts more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials they were inspired
<START> this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and that's meaning it as a compliment because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century most notably adaptations of e m forster novels this very merchant ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with self discovery they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline dester played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks and not just in the style of hair she wears and mrs fisher joan plowright this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine it's the movie it wants to be alfred molina and jim broadbent then relatively new to american audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of near magical elements full of quiet moments and wonder
<START> i watched this film over a hundred times it is really best serbian movie made ever i wood like to recommend this movie to everyone it is very good comedy i surely like it
<START> this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in 1930s canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'rudy' and 'awakenings' it picks up late in grey owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period br br the film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over trapped beaver he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earth's resources this is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen br br the casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond films br br i would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or environmental causes it is a movie for families as well however children under 10 depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot
<START> a young scientist harry harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum when he finds out there is an accident involving harry losing an arm so he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own br br oh we've seen this oh so many times before but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons elke sommer and oliver reed actually it's not a bad flick by fangoria films just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein servered ties simply lacks it own distinctive style the oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled re animator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from evil dead 2 br br the comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor surprises do crop up especially the flick's final outcome which is well accepted as i thought it could have copped out with something more accessible for a low budget production the fx makeup can look rigid and very goofy but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story thanks to elke sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother oliver reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well they were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate billy morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as harry director damon santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror br br yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment
<START> blood surf aka krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes dax miller taryn reif kate fischer duncan regehr joel west matt borlenghi maureen larrazabal cris vertido susan africa archie adamos rolando santo domingo and malecio amayao the acting by the actors is fairly good the thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed fairly good as well same thing goes for the music the film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end this is a fairly thrilling film if you the the cast in the film monsters giant animal films horror thrillers mystery and interesting films then i recommend you to see this film today
<START> with very little screen time and money dan katzir manages to do so much this movie in its heart warming simplicity touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle rejuvinated lust
<START> a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster br br recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening it's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it this is a real drive in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects the monster a mix of stop motion and a life size head is a charmingly quaint little beast the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem sure its clear that its all fake but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief actually i think its about really cool monsters which this has br br i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films boggy creek etc
<START> my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughton's night of the hunter which remains superb in my canon but it may have been supplanted by shower which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water and the way that water can be made inspiration and comfort and cleansing and etc is the essence of the dao it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image yet shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod i revere both
<START> it's hard to believe that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame with x files one of the best sci fi series ever being at the top of the glory nine years later he is almost forgotten and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably i cannot even explain why he is a fair actor but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from br br at the same time angelina jolie was much less known and she was really lucky that a film like 'playing god' did not led her career into a dead end fortunately for her 'the bone collector' and 'girl interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner and when lara croft came her career was launched br br there is not too much to be told about this film it's the only big screen film of andy wilson and there must be a reason all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob the off screen voice is especially bad with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental stores or on tv try to look for something better
<START> vertigo co stars stewart in his last turn as a romantic lead and novak elevate this stewart's other christmas movie movie to above mid level entertainment the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people's relationships all in all a nice diversion with legendary stars 7 10
<START> gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders gere who plays babbage refers to them as his flock gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out he is training new comer allison to take over his job gere sees his flock as very sick disturbed puppies he asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes he keeps getting warned for this behavior hence the reason he is being replaced during his final few days on the job a young girl goes missing and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol so he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police that part is a little far fetched br br there is some sick twisted stuff shown in this film like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other also there are the people who kidnapped the girl at the end of the film we see what sick freaks they are however i wouldn't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film br br final verdict if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers then you will like this
<START> there's nothing i hate more than self congratulating pretentiousness kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid i don't really mind inexperience and low budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes the money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager if you watch project greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really at all when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world the revolution can't come soon enough go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits thank you and good day
<START> we don't have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube it's dumb immature and boring this is from the creator of earthworm jim douglas tennapel i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this the cartoonist hasn't done anything for years since now for doug tennapel this is a comeback travesty and an all time low the story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master they are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on boring the animation is dreadful the main characters are meant to be cats right but they don't look nothing like cats just weird animal monster looking creatures with big mouths pointed teeth and bulgy eyes the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly the theme song is terrible and irritating also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows it surprised me how this show got 7 5 10 votes of other imdb viewers television really isn't what is used to be but now most of them is dumb cheaply made and boring some of you on the website might not agree with me well i'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain don't have too tolerate this crap oh yeah if you have digital you have to but i don't so it not my problem loser 2 10 and it's very lucky to get that because i've given other shows worst
