<START> this is the worst imaginable crap the novel by h rider haggard is very entertaining and dramatic the makers of this worthless movie don't follow it closely well old novels aren't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one's own if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered down clichÃ©s one should stick to the original if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard but there's no imagination at all only tiredness this should be bought or watched only by collectors of victorian novels made into movies br br just a hint and not a spoiler i think to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or god forbid waste money on buying this gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal
<START> i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like however this being said he's made a lot of films and i've seen just a few in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in the thin red line nolte has a a full range of acting talents when it's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial hand and body gestures without saying anything having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors by and large have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in had chaplin lived in our times who knows he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools br br i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen however the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid even with all its surprises of course on the outset it appears preposterous however it is also not impossible br br consider these for starters a spy at the heart of the third reich he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe america's most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard look at amazon for more details consider history undercover piercing the reich american spies inside nazi germany dvd i saw this here http store aetv com html product index jhtml id 75054 seems to be a history channel production br br so is the story ridiculous far fetched yes impossible no back to the plot nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts was it a type of passivity that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part that's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp but it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things br br the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin always fantastic is very good in a small role br br i was really shocked by the ending of the film no i won't spoil it and it made me feel terrible about the choice did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages hard to say but it really jolts br br nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things it's very entertaining and provoking what great movies should be a bit long but worth it by the way the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers arvo part
<START> bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip offs in the early 80's some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was 1 one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding but everything else about this movie seriously reeks for actual post nuke fun go track down a copy of endgame after the fall of new york or escape from the bronx instead they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish
<START> i'm a big porsche fan and the car was the best star in this film br br haim the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor characters actors would be pointless needless to say they were all very average it's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's with some weird clothes some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot br br all in all please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies corey haim or like myself love old school porsches this one in particular looks great because life's too short to watch crappy movies
<START> went to see the movie troy this afternoon here's what i learned br br contrary to popular opinion and history in general greek men were not gay ever this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter so it is safe for american dudes to see this movie br br helen of troy always had impeccable hair and makeup she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which though numerous were probably all filmed on the same day one after the other with the director saying alright now look beautiful good ok now look frightened good now look depressed good now look interested good now look beautiful again good br br most greek and trojan men had british accents those with american accents couldn't act br br trojans looked just like greeks but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen br br brad pitt does not blink on camera br br helen of troy's biggest line was they're coming for me br br trojan music sounded remarkably like modern bulgarian music br br brad pitt's thighs go all the way up br br achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close but it's ok they were cousins never mind what history says br br peter o'toole can tell an entire story with just an expression br br trojan gods apparently all had greek names but their statues either looked egyptian or like peter o'toole in drag br br greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting much like american men br br all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color light egyptian by max factor br br troy had only three women br br there were lots of blond greeks which is good news for brad pitt who would otherwise have really stuck out br br despite their coastal desert locale greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires funeral pyres trojan horses and the like br br british actors look silly with greek hairdos br br brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes br br greek soldiers fought constantly but their outfits always looked impeccable br br greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts br br apparently greek temples were always in ruins even back when they were all new
<START> if you were born around the time this movie was finished and had a liberal open minded household that i had i'm sure during the early 80's you'd be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies you know not 100 pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography or that you'd sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a vhs you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet like buttons out of fear of being discovered whatever the case such films were sent into the back of your mind waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual art needless to say this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a t many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized i am more disturbed by the subtleties was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination interracial relations bed frame masturbation voyeurism or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder pedophilia homosexuality or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18th century france who can say but despite mr borowcyzk's taste for vivid raw sexuality being the norm for his works i'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality once i have learned this the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore it is well worth checking out
<START> one question why first off the premise is not funny or engaging at all they use taped interviews and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts first off the interviews aren't funny or entertaining to begin with and even if they were i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally without being turned into cartoons how does that add any hilarity to it i turned on cbs's monday night sitcom line up which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays and found this on of course the sitcom line up would be reruns anyway being summer but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining i tried to give cc a chance i really did when it started i figured well maybe it will be funny nope and then it kept going it was a long half hour br br and i can almost see if there was a purpose if the interviews were shown in their entirety and had points to them but no it was just one line clips cut and pasted together really quick it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network's robot chicken i wasn't a fan of cbs' now cancelled sitcom the class while that was on it was one half hour of the line up i would struggle through but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of creatures let's just say i'd take the class considering it's been a couple hours since it aired and i come on here to see i am the first to comment i guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it and that it won't last much longer cartoon roadkill
<START> cheezy action movie starring dolph lungren lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job but the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he s going to hang it up things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery its dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair what a stupid movie watchable in a i can t believe people made this sort of way this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school don t ask they crash into the security turret don t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school and smash its barely constructed form apart it doesn't look like it did in earlier shots what hath the gods of bad movies wrought actually i m perplexed since this was directed by sydney j furie a really good director who made films like the boys in company c has his ability failed him or was this hopeless from the get go and he didn't even bother it s a turkey a watchable one but a turkey none the less
<START> fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale big edie and her daughter little edie aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis they live in a rodent infested rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 the content is pretty much made up of two things the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer actress and dancer these discussions usually become very rhetorical nonsensical and often times amusing the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus coming each day to record and chuckle at whatever bizarre behavior may come about ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable
<START> i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didn't remember it as something to cherish the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy him br br
<START> this was an excellent film i don't understand why so many people don't like it there was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that weren't said i was thoroughly entertained and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story now i haven't read this particular book of robbin's so i don't now how this matched up but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation the movie left a lot for you to define yourself which is the best part of any tom robbins novel dreaming up the details br br to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts far from the worst ever this movie was glorious long live the whooping crane
<START> heather graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie i've seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this film drops br br omg i'm heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while she's passed out i'm really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i'm at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b tch get a grip br br what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it it's as simple as that
<START> i'm in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i've seen in a long time i've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but really i think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible it's not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven't seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to clichÃ© visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn't even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you're going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don't let stunt folk act they can't also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it's not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they're all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it's better than i could do of course i also know i can't make movies so i don't try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i've seen several thousand in the year i've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack
<START> hollywood hotel was the last movie musical that busby berkeley directed for warner bros his directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras by the last few years of the thirties swing style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits the swing era also called the big band era has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949 although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the swing era began benny goodman's engagement at the palomar ballroom in los angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream america's youth when goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society style dance music that his band had been playing the youth in the audience went wild that was the beginning but since radio live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts in hollywood hotel the appearance of benny goodman and his orchestra and raymond paige and his orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste the film was in production only a year and a half or so after goodman's palomar ballroom engagement there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in hollywood hotel but except for benny goodman and his orchestra's sing sing sing there isn't a lot to commend otherwise the most interesting musical sequences are the opening hooray for hollywood parade and let that be a lesson to you production number at the drive in restaurant the film is most interesting to see and hear benny goodman and his orchestra play and dick powell and frances langford sing
<START> the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u boat these sequences are lively and well filmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
<START> this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom jerry signed a peace treaty things are idyllic for a time but predictably it goes sour probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe a frying pan and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network
<START> saving grace is never riotously funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree brenda blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower grace who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts the supporting cast also does a fine job french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role the premise alone is appealing the idea of an over the hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work that was a mindless gag that didn't quite take off the film's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen samurai the geisha world of kyoto originate from some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings the geisha dances were not authentic there was far too much use of chinese music a minor but essential detail proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy interestingly some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons
<START> this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years not pompous like the british not gung ho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed dismally either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side true australians i e non imports are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam
<START> like his earlier film in a glass cage agustÃ­ villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over the top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
