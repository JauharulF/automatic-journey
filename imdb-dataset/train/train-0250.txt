<START> i think this could've been a decent movie and some of its parts are ok but in whole it's a b movie same about the plot parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up acting is mostly ok i've seen worse of this too br br the beginning sets the level with cars driving in the desert making cool but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes in slow motion cool like the drivers had never seen sand before it gets slightly better from there but not much br br if you're gonna rent this get another one too and use this one as a warm up keep expectations low and it might work for you
<START> this was the modesty that we didn't know it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before in their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother the purists should also note that we really don't know if everything she told miklos was true because she was stalling for time i didn't rent or borrow the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don't want a refund i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy miklos just like in the novels and comic strips i too can't wait for the next modesty and willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what's to come
<START> after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasn't the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being married very lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family i'll stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel
<START> a turkish bath sequence in a film noir located in new york in the 50's that must be a hint at something something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie br br the turkish baths sequence a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy sauna and scalise wrapped in a sheet getting his thighs massaged steve the masseur is of the young rough boxer beefcake type and another guy a bodyguard finishes dressing up dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away we know he has a reputation for roughing up suspects good cop but getting out of control easy why is it that he hates them so much br br could it be that he hates himself this part of himself he inherited from his father that dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk into the gutter what if that dark side lurked within a closet remember whenever dixon meets scalise 3 times the guy is lying on a bed and he only has men around him for company the irony of the girls poster pinned up on the wall near his bed br br scalise acts funny affected manners cranking his neck arrogantly defiant shoving his inhalator poppers into his nostrils each time he talks to dixon dixon with a vengeance is bent on pinning down scalise who seems not to understand i never saw a man so full of hate as you i consider it almost humorous the way you came after me alone four years jumping at me as if i was somebody special why br br because scalise is someone special indeed he is the direct inheritor of dixon's father your father liked me your father set me up in business he stands as dixon's criminal brother his dark side incarnate and to top it all he prefers the company of men dixon knows it well who killed him paine you or one of your playmates playmates notice how each time they meet dixon manhandles scalise he picks the address book out of his jacket slaps his face punches him scalise i warn you not to touch me dixon's homophobia is obvious or put it different his unexpressed homosexuality dixon aka dixon's kid is the son of a thief in reaction to this he decided to become a cop a good one but there is something of the criminal in him a dark side he is a violent copper a murderer a liar besides he is not married brings a dizzy blonde to his familiar eat out place every now and then but nothing else the waitress scoffing says that he doesn't know how to make love to a woman dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and hates himself for those reasons a hood and a mobster like his old man blood will tell finally in order to achieve redemption dixon decides to sacrifice himself if he gets his alter ego scalise to kill him he will free himself from the guilt and free the girl and her father too br br the end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence scalise is pushed in the gutter and dixon deserves the right to walk the sidewalk and wins the love of the dame he is straight at last br br the unspoken theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his repressed feelings wants to experience a woman's love jean douchet br br these notes owe a lot to the film commentary by jean douchet in the french dvd edited by carlottai
<START> warning contains many spoilers br br let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof br br the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thought provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflÃ© it exemplifies why i hate 99 of british cinema it feels too long it's tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think there's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isn't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woods alice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts what few lines there were didn't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f word that would make bridget jones's friend shazza proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic 'oh that's terrible' reaction br br alice isn't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either she's got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough as old boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middle class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security entertainment system i e becoming mrs robinson to a wanna be cockney wide boy electrician someone pass me a tissue the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she would've been intolerably one dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when she's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault br br i can't say that adam fared much better either danny dyer played him well as a fish out of water jack the lad but a good performance couldn't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background br br this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on talk about stiff upper lip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week br br saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that one and a bit hours of my life back please
<START> this one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by adrian pasdar in the past but he caught the perfect balance in this performance avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions the always wonderful julie waters is terrific here and anyone who has not yet scene her in 1983's educating rita should rent it immediately marvelous film the rest of the supporting characters are well played as well many marvelously eccentric without going over the top this one is fun
<START> this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around all the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant plus jodie foster and cherie currie are simply amazing in this the ending is very powerful however i won't spoil it for you and i thought the character development was top notch plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially jeanie and annie as you will be rooting for them plus i loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about i can't believe this only has a 5 9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well one scene that really got to me was when madge marilyn kagan is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well plus the dialog is especially excellent this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say go see it immediately your bound to love it the direction is fantastic adrian lyne does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace the acting is amazing jodie foster is really cute and is amazing as always she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and cherie currie were the heart of the film as jeanie and annie foster rules cherie currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing scott baio is great as brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him randy quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him sally kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are both very good as madge and deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends laura dern has a very early role here as it was cool to see her not much of a part though rest of the cast do fine overall go see it immediately it's an underrated masterpiece out of 5
<START> fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by david f friedman the lead actress stacey walker is well cast and strangely attractive she resembles a deranged renee zellweger with a bad hair do this chick only made two of these films and then moved back to texas the music is terrible one of her boyfriends is played by sam melville from the tv show the rookies using a different name br br best line in the film from tony are you putting me on doll none of my chicks put me on good b w cinematography from laslo kovacs easy rider targets many others good locales cool swimming pool also used in the defilers strange ending but fitting a 4 out of 10 best performance stacey walker
<START> this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization in reality perhaps they are after all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne br br matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film he is still trying to remember who he was how he has gotten where he is he gets help from a couple of folks it seems like every minute of the film somebody is trying to kill him br br there is little time for rest in this film the action sequences seem very very real there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism make it seem less hollywood than many pictures these sequences add realism to the film in feeling br br the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series
<START> i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written thank you peter hedges and because when steve carell stars in the film you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding dan in real life delivered that promise br br the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys the cast sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead
<START> this is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism of heterosexuals the film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character adrian pasdar is very believable as gerald geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting the directing of christopher monger is very sensitively treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture
<START> kurt thomas in one of the series of gymnast olympic stars turned movie stars movies that mercifully only includes one other mitch gaylord in american anthem at least that one had janet jones this one has um a gymnast using his martial arts and his gymnastic skills to save a european country from dictatorship sure it could happen on a scale of one to ten a 0
<START> the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of laughs lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill kid pleasing and not difficult for a parent to watch either
<START> a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind in one of the compartments he meets with a girl words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words
<START> isn't anyone else tired of that old clichÃ©' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film gives us some informations and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason i know i am br br the sad thing is that it's use in this film is worthless if you have seen the first film the first remake i should say then the information given is completely worthless because you would have already known it i guess you can that it isn't worthless to the main characters but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head wouldn't he want to live sure he would have died anyway br br this is the second film to be titled the hills have eyes ii the first being the sequel to the original 70's film this is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me see i'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a hhe2 to begin with much less an original hhe1 and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original hhe1 it just makes it worse but anyways br br wes craven's original hills have eyes was decent in the end though the idea was better than the presentation but he most likely had a low budget to be quite honest wes craven isn't that good of a horror director he's only made a few good horror movies nightmare on elm st new nightmare a few alright ones scream and a bunch of horrible ones cursed shocker vampire in brooklyn oh yeah and he made swamp thing as well but the original hhe2 falls under the latter category i've only seen a few minutes but it was terrible br br now he has co written the new hhe2 and it's such a disappointment last year's hhe remake was even better than the original film it was tense i guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers it made us feel dirty for the first hour we were in hell and finally in the last few moments the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good br br this new film has no tension no suspense whatsoever just violent things happening to mostly stupid people there is hardly any menacing presence here just ugly hobos hiding under rocks br br i'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making it was just the other day that i watching deep blue sea where samuel l jackson kept on walking around the water while giving the speech and then he gets eaten by a shark only because the idiot stayed to close to the water something that nobody would do in the given situation here is the exact same thing people go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying seriously couldn't a potty break wait and then when you think people would have learned someone else goes of by themselves seriously isn't more scary when the characters are bringing their a game and still losing i would think so br br it even under delivers it should have made the first remake look like the fog remake which was less menacing than an episode of becker more bad guys more time in the caves more tension more of everything br br but it actually downgrades less bad guys no tension sure we have more time in the caves but not a whole lot happens there in the end it only seems like there is two or three bad guys the last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people where is this tribe who keeps on watching them through binoculars seriously these are the things this film should have brought us but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us with that exact same being watched scene come on i'll give the devil it's due the look of the film is good but thats it br br i don't even think fans of gore will like this though i'm probably wrong there is gore though most of it is sped up while in the dark but without the tension and characters you even care about the gore does nothing in my book in the end you're not frightened you re not shocked unless you're an 8 year old girl you don't even feel like you have seen anything new
<START> this is a fantastic series first and foremost it is very well done and very interesting as a huge wwii buff i had learned a lot before seeing this series one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds comparatively speaking that is it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii but really think only the die hards such as myself will want to buy this or watch it more than once my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike
<START> i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings i am from denmark though it is very good definitely with an understanding of the horror genre the monster towards the end is very scary people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics br br
<START> this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10
<START> the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour it incorporates world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well askey playing the role of tommy gander is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or dragging br br the story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards it is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is the ghost train gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well he is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being annoying but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940's humour his humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch br br if it was not for askey gander than this film would of been shorter in action enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion
<START> a meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal rot faced shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage a ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal director co writer producer todd sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go straight for the throat lively and gruesome horror fare he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout fills the screen with wall to wall crazy action and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum moreover sheets certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over the top splatter this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting evisceration lots of gut munching one dude has his heart yanked out and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end for example almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow granted this flick has its fair share of flaws the ragged editing several ham fisted attempts at pathos and the largely awful acting from a rank no name cast all leave a good deal to be desired top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky kasey rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful daria trumillio frank dunlay likewise does well as rugged take charge army veteran ralph walsh best of all sheets' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish
