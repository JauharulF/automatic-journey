<START> this series it's something different sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way edel starck is great it has all great plot smart witty always well delivered lines an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin one of the most interesting city in the world it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once feel the old europe way of dealing with life kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come watching the series in german is super
<START> comes this heartwarming tale of hope hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again cough razzie award cough br br i disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained when i requested my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing 'i wasn't entitled to reimbursement' i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though br br the movie summary is pretty basic the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits or not br br ask yourself the following do you like to see people getting hit by pans do you like fart jokes do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus do you like tired racial jokes do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa' do you drool br br if you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you although it has been billed in some places as 'the worst movie of the decade' there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse somewhere i can't say for sure i gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously br br this lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone save your money for something funny br br respect
<START> ugh this is a terrible film full of disastrous comic relief no scares and scary leaps in story and plotline the only creepy thing here is the leading lady's hats lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows i give this a 1 and this ain't no fun
<START> i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a person's interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this aren't made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure
<START> i wasn't terribly impressed with dante's 1st season offering in homecoming it wasn't much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate
<START> this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through none of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative the final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and joyless
<START> i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a so good it's bad plan 9 for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81 the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is non existent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi'd thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literally zero budget fan films that are available on the 'net the star wars short troops for example the whole we're enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an 8 figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the ex soft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn't screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
<START> this is absolutely the worst movie i've seen all year br br first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast br br this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers br br this was worse than watching a car wreck
<START> contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester rifle has only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will geer as a very unearp like wyatt earp the casting of the villains was good stephen mcnally as surly dutch henry dan duryea as waco johnny dean and john mcintire versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldn't stand a chance
<START> i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost verbatim a campaign only imdb knows br br as for this movie it's fine it's a funny cute and very straightforward movie br br it's been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character yup do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican puerto rican kids possible you betcha does that make this movie a crime Â as some of the to my eyes astroturf comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom br br this is better than any episode of degrassi jr high or degrassi high scoff at the comparison but we've never had that and i'm touched to the core by this movie's humility of purpose and tender spirit br br that said i'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting d
<START> so i'm at home flipping channels one night and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on hbo naturally i did a double take and decided i'd watch for a little while i didn't change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious the next time it was on i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch during the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit while many stand up comedians mesh together in my brain eddie izzard stands out as one of the best his style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events his show stayed with me afterwards i went to italy over the summer and all i could think about while i was there was how italians are always on scooters going 'ciao ' 10 out of 10 see it you won't regret it
<START> i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe it's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird re telling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him i didn't understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if you're only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this movie has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b movies and old sci fi flicks
<START> what a waste this movie could have really been something decent but the writing in particular is crap and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting mike meyers was good and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted but overall this movie was a big waste of time instead the movie to watch that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame is the great boogie nights
<START> this film should have been only 10 minutes i mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing i even hesitate to call it a movie the opening credits of the film was somehow promising as the film begins by short comments of the man himself you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from cohen's life well nick cave does a reasonable job covering one of cohen's famous songs the length of cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy but as it turns out cave's performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat i mean what does the filmmaker really think five minute close up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in australia what does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding fake applause to these endless nasty performances the film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see there is not a single footage of cohen's past in fact except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer poet there is absolutely nothing if you add up all the minutes that cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes but these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming cohen's lyrics if you ever decided to waste your money on this film don't just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time
<START> after reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else either that or he is simply bad most importantly where is the lightness from the very first scene music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel' in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them so that everything actually feels heavy br br another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street who is on his way to see sabina the introduction of this chance meeting passing which im sure didn't happen in the book gives tomas' story more significance than it does make it light br br there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie such is kundera's style this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film a film which is as long as it is uncompelling for those who haven't read the book yet i recommend just reading that for those who have i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay clear warnings
<START> are you a giraffe ask john to nadia and she sure of responding well responds him yes in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in birthday girl a film that i heard a lot of times but i don't dare to see until two hours of write this br br birthday girl is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count at the same time that nicole kidman is one of the best actress besides she is pretty and intelligent that i have ever seen birthday girl is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet the woman that he finds comes from russia she seems to be that delicate woman normal not more one day in her birthday comes suddenly his cousin and his friend the man begin to discover certain things since here he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been br br much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel but birthday girl is just the opposite this movie is full of good surprises good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind birthday girl have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes but at the same time certain touching nature and makes it so deeper br br birthday girl is sometimes sad sometimes funny sometimes violent but at the end is totally satisfactory and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece br br sorry for the mistakes well if there any
<START> i was always a big fan of this movie first of all have you seen the cast the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well cybill shepherd was given great reviews for her role and they were well deserved the beginning of this movie starts in the past when corinne jeffries cybill whose picture perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband louie dies unexpectedly fortunately louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be recycled back to earth as the newborn alex finch robert downey jr alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while corinne tries to get on with hers but fate crosses alexs path 23 years later when he meets corinne's daughter miranda mary stuart masterson and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories this is where the fun begins and embarrassing situations occur the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance chances are you'll like it very funny and sweet
<START> i go to ucsb and take some classes with the executive producer alison anders she's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on i thought must be pretty good this film as a selection at the santa barbara film festival seemed like a good choice br br while this movie included some nice shots and cinematography the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish my main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground the soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up i just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good
<START> this is a feel good movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasn't trying to make 'good night and good luck' here let's not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare br br and very enjoyable at that br br do we remember what 1984 was like we've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was fun fluff and she went ahead and did it br br like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of out of towners goldie knows what she is doing she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really well br br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laugh in and every thing she's ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she is and that's that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it you are old wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments if it even comes that late br br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
<START> the vampire bat is set in the small german village of klineschloss where gustave schoen lionel belmore the burgermeister is holding a meeting with inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas from the local constabulary about all the recent murders six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat meanwhile the latest victim martha mueller rita carlyle has been found brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible if it is how's he going to stop it br br directed by frank r strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars atwill wray their success in the previous years doctor x 1932 is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative enticing title may have lead you to believe quite frankly it's rather dull the script by edward t lowe jr takes itself rather seriously sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers that something could possibly be a vampire then for most of it's duration the film focuses on brettschneider his incompetent investigations which are not to put too fine a point on it boring the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci fi there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the character's are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat i know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 a bland flat dull boring misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesn't cut it these days just look at the original king kong 1933 released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today i didn't like it i doubt many modern film goers would either it's as simple straight forward as that br br director strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of it's age as a whole it's pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff there isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house 1932 universal's european set on their back lot are nice add a certain ambiance to things br br technically the vampire bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern for the age of it it's alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong speaking of king kong it's star fay wray has a role in this as does horror icon lionel atwill i'll be kind say the acting is ok br br the vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isn't personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore it's short it tells it's story reasonably enough but i must admit i'm not a fan
