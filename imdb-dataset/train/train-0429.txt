<START> mel torme and victor borge in their younger years serve to make this film interesting and especially viewing a young sinatra on the sunny side of 30 and definitely conveying that this was his yes i'm a popular singer but hardly an actor yet stage michele morgan is an annoying inane presence and jack haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me leon erroll is silly as always but overall pretty funny 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right grade because with the combination of its positive aspects along with the lack of much of a story and a silly one at that and the fore mentioned annoyances it is overall average at best most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years
<START> for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et al martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature br br the premise is easy enough cool hood meets small town sheriff and all hell ensues but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us br br no this isn't casablanca nor is it great literature but it is a serious movie about cars rebellion and the genius that is martin sheen br br enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and for what martin will become i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's and you will too
<START> i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it's a film about an internet s m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she's murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow br br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he's in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won't even explain the ending because quite frankly i can't make it out myself but before the final scene we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all br br all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining
<START> unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it it's obviously a low budget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work that's not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didn't know how bad though it's bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire fighting there's no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again it's obviously a kid's movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something it's bearable but much better if you're say nine
<START> this movie was great the first time i saw it when it was called lost in translation but somehow bill murray turned into an eccentric black man played by morgan freeman scarlett johansson turned into a cranky latino woman played by paz vega and tokyo japan turned into carson california instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in translation we get meaningless blabbering in 10 items that verges on annoying instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in translation we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about how can a character that wears hundred dollar t shirts and has never been inside a target department store expect to give advice to a working class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant don't think that stops him if he isn't giving her clothing advice he's telling her what she should eat the most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand be it washing the car stopping at arby's or just laying around to list off their 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate i kept wanting to yell at them saying didn't you say you had somewhere to be what the heck are doing a minute ago you were practically late now you're eating roast beef and pondering your lives until i saw this movie i never truly understood how something could insist upon itself but i think this movie does exactly that and undeservedly so the dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympatheticÂwith the exception that i felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project
<START> before she went into politics or public service glenda jackson was one of britain's finest film actresses this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years and jenny played by american ann margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him you see familiar faces like sheila keith patsy byrne and frank finlay you can't help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes it's not the greatest movie but it's good to see glenda's amazing talent she is still a fantastic actress comedy or drama she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her
<START> utterly pretentious nonsense the material is dull dull dull and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in allen's earlier films and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second rate though mysteriously popular ferrell even more it appears that the morose 70 year old allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century br br i truly tried to get involved in the film but it was just impossible my snyapses couldn't fire that slowly so rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position i got up left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re read george bailey's great tome of 30 years ago germans the day turned out pretty well after all no thanks to woody
<START> i rated basic instinct 2 high yet that movie got less than a 4 rating this film only got a 4 from me but it has 7 3 from over 600 people i don't see a reason why they like this film so much br br this film is boring because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house and it only has a total of 5 people in this film it is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary many of dialogues are slow and meaningless the film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch the film can just be shorten to a few sentences br br this film reminds me of three times directed by hou hsiao hsien that one is equally boring the dialogues are also equally boring it also has a high rating i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished br br this film lacks of passion or excitement
<START> i was looking forward to kathryn bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscars which it was awarded unfortunately it really isn't a good movie the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard the actors put in a good effort but for me i didn't really get what the movie was trying to be it's not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket not as epic as band of brothers not as action packed as well anything i certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years i suppose there's not a lot to choose from
<START> steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices family and pressure by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat out comedy lots of laughs and unrealistic elements but i guess i was wrong sure the movie had some comedy but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance the movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element i found but the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable through out the cinematography was great the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important though it came down to old flat and predictable ending i'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie perhaps for the bad even this movie would get better publicity still a fun movie
<START> rural family drama with perhaps a nod to ordinary people concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap despite downbeat subject matter given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring unfortunately the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience what with robert duvall glenn close and wilford brimley in the cast the movie is nearly a small scaled reunion of the natural too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping memorable picture 1 2 from
<START> i have copies of both these movies the classic where robert blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the 1967 movie blake is more shown standing by a window in jail telling his childhood life where it makes since why he killed the clutter family doesn't show much in the classic of what really went on an doesn't tell us which one really done the killing but it's a great eye catcher really if you watch the 1996 movie in cold blood the classic makes a lot more sence
<START> big rock candy mountain is amazing i watched it when i was little and still do to this day senior in high school if i could imagine heaven that is what it would look like i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees zach hyman is profs and my best friend little bunny foo foo is the man it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night in fact my friend who is 18 recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit thanks bye
<START> another movie that relies upon the trite worn out clichÃ© of the mad scientist gone madder the movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead back to life i know i know you've never heard that one before of course as all of these movies go the experiment goes very very wrong and creates a maniacal bloodthirsty creature for this promising setup you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful wrong like many movies of this era the idea is nice but the execution and the script is mediocre not the worst horror movie i've seen no abominator the evilmaker 2 still takes the cake but not one of the gems either
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is just that a campy concoction of fun sex appeal horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair do this movie is sure to delight any fan of elvira's it takes you upclose and personal with elvira and probes deep into her um past revealing her enormous ancestry br br the movie takes you on a ride with elvira as she goes from tv horror hostess with the mostess to her home town of fallwell mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased great aunt where she encounters a stuffy town a studly cinema owner a creepy great uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks a slew of high school kids that immediately love her and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town even if it means burning her at the stake watch elvira woo the kids stalk the stud avoid her creepy great uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight 'preservatives' who have no kind words for her in elvira mistress of the dark br br as elvira would say i guarantee it'll be a scream screams in background whoa good thing i didn't say it'd be a gas
<START> with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only 60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job br br they have combined state of the art digital animation the perfectly cast voice talents of ray romano john leguizamo and dennis leary among many others to create a highly entertaining family film with a strong message about cooperation friendship and caring for your fellow herd members and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd br br while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders br br david newman yet another member of the newman family of hollywood composers provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and at times is positively toe tapping br br the overall look of the film is incredible an intensely coloured strangely believable fantasyland of snow geysers mud rocks and ice the individual characters were delightfully believable too with the facial expressions of ray romano's Âmanfred' being a particular treat br br the entire sequence with the dodos will leave no doubt as to where the expression dumb as a dodo comes from ' br br this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized but real nonetheless br br it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home
<START> some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either you'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs but beautiful moonlight becomes you it's always you the day after forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected ballad once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously why else make merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend mentor to arthur so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it
<START> french production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11 minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september 11 br br the film segments vary widely in content and quality two allude to u s complicity in terrorist acts in chile against allende who died on september 11 1973 depicted in the segment by british director ken loach and in palestine by u s backed israelis shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine two more recall other destructive acts a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv shot by israeli director amos gitan the japanese holy war against the west in ww ii by shohei imamura br br ironies abound in several stories shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn's piece bringing the man momentary joy but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone in mira nair's film based on a real incident a missing young man also in new york city the son of a pakistani family is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers br br there are poignant moments dotted throughout loach has his exiled chilean man quote st augustine to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage anger at the way things are courage to change them imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren exiled in iran trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp where two men have fallen into a deep well one killed the other sustaining a broken leg this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds br br idrissa ouedraogo from burkina faso creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist in order to get the 25 million u s reward he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute br br it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu maker of amores perros who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment one that for the most part shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic then with a translation added does god's light guide us or blind us in various languages with english subtitles grade 8 10 b seen on 10 31 04 if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites
<START> brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are disappearing everybody is concerned but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening nor can they prevent it from happening bear with me bela lugosi is responsible for this as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive continue to bear with me finally the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances but of course they can't figure out the improbable motive let's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on if you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess you will be treated to lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed and other vague parodies of real horror films the kind with budgets and plots anyhoo a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen and then the fun really starts br br the cinematography and acting are ok there are a lot of well dressed very good looking people in this film the directing is fair and the script is a little better than the material deserved nevertheless this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b film fan the best thing about it it does eventually end but not soon enough
<START> everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of Âles visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because she's replacing her but that's Âgrotesque' lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a cÃ©sar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played Âlemercier playing her role' as for the story it's just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poirÃ© and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and dÃ©jÃ  vu no really there's no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a Âbrainless moment' 2 10
