<START> riding giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into the world of one of the most under appreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director stacy peralta could capture everything from the structure to the players to the amazing stock footage to even the style in which this was filmed only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing of all the surfing films that i have seen endless summer billabong odyssey and step into liquid this was the most consistent and relevant beginning with the early ages of surfing a brief history lesson lasting all the way till laird's infamous ride riding giants goes further into the mind heart and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries how does it do this by giving us the whole story from start to finish without fictionalizing or jig jagging from wave to wave br br to begin this film was structurally sound in the other films that i have seen about surfing you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person wave to wave event to event without any knowledge of why or who in riding giants we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies this allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one also instead of just riding waves we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before this is what really attracted me to this film i was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves because it is a big wave movie we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves i loved the information about the beach bums or father's of surfing i am still floored by the amazing tales of greg noll and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue then to see him in person talking about what was going on in his mind only added more fuel to the fire the straightforward structure that peralta followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you cannot help but be amazed by what these brave people have done and where the sport is going br br add to a immaculate structure some intense and creative cinematography and you have darn near perfect film using techniques that i last saw in the kid stays in the picture riding giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen while it isn't 3d it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other in this film it worked it created more depth to the scenes and really added to not just the shock value man these waves were huge but also the danger that these guys constantly faced if it broke differently or they maneuvered wrong these waves would kill them some did die but it didn't stop the sport it only created more excitement and more passion to do better it is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point br br the human element so many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves but very little about the people the films knew that people were watching for the waves so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person this film was the direct opposite peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves but devoting so much more attention onto the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this everyday what rushes through their minds what pushes them to go further and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue yonder i felt like after watching this film that i not only knew more about big wave surfing but also about the emotional side to the sport this was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed riding giants to a whole new personal level br br overall this film was brilliant never have i witnessed so much passion devotion and love wrapped in a structurally sound film from beginning to end i was impressed i would be very happy if this film won the oscar this year for best documentary and to see a new rebirth in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature br br grade out of
<START> by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over as films were moving in a different direction comedically and otherwise with television looming on the horizon hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time where one wonders would movies have gone had television not come along or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years mr blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed br br ad man jim blandings along with his wife and two daughters are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications well almost had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind then again he might not have you decide on this frail premise a wonderful film results full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one nothing comes easy in this life as mr blandings learns but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way there is after all the long run but blandings asks himself every few minutes how long is long br br this movie is a delight it is not i suppose a masterpiece in the capra mccarey tradition but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically there is real warmth in the picture and a good deal of w c fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically but not so much as to leave a bad taste the people in the film are all very smart and affluent but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class br br lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr and mrs blandings to perfection while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend who often has to bring up unpleasant topics such as how the real world works there is too a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut in a few short years things would change as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns which soon would be connected by highways littered with bottles and cans their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city
<START> i cannot believe that i wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish the previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and i was really looking forward to this but most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible suranne jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines but most of the rest of the cast followed her example notable exceptions were bernard hill and anne reid old stagers whose diction was exemplary do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible as a result i suppose i lost track of what was going on and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them and us thing between muslims and the rest i soon lost interest the ending was a complete anti climax a complete dud
<START> this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur having big tyranosaurous like hind legs when it should just look like an over sized crocodile everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes cliche minute after minute why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate plus there's always a guy and girl who share a lame obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations to much has already been said by me and i feel as if i'm wasting my time writing this
<START> capt gallagher lemmon and flight attendant eve clayton vaccaro are a supposedly hot item in this death trip a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub slash hotelÂ there's even a blind piano player who falls in love karen wallace grant is the hysterical b 3 who'll do anything to get attention from henpecked husband martin christopher lee and later the rest of the people on board br br memorable moments boeing 747 doing a belly flop in the atlantic ocean karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far and furniture and screaming people who become 'ball bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine ' br br the action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal but not much goes on in between hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel but i forget the reason why notÂ he would've done wonders for the 1970 original on which this sequel is partly inspired '77 also got inspiration from the flight of the phoenix' br br actors cotten and de havilland reunite from their days on hush hush sweet charlotte' apparently here they are not playing heavies just reunited Âautumn years' lovers and isn't the actress playing emily's companion the same one who played the hammered to death maid on whatever happened to baby jane ' br br tv actors include the girlfriend from mayberry rfd' her character's daughter wins a drawing contest or something lame like that buck rogers' gil gerard and dynasty's' pamela bellwood br br
<START> i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads and of karl malden bob newhart and the cameo appearances by robert morley and cesar romero
<START> camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot this time they've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness br br this time around there's a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea i've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife br br unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how there's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom br br i don't know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for 5 just like they did in the second movie they still haven't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well it's a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films you'll get some fun out of this one
<START> lots and lots of information to digest and if you've seen zizek you know his pace br br also if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc you will be somewhat lost br br and the film list is long director includes hitchcock psycho vertigo birds lynch lost highway mullholland falls wild at heart blue velvet tarkovsky stalker solaris and the conversation coppola br br there are some segway films like star wars espisode iii matrix but these i suspect are baits to be sure zizek is never boring but if you don't buy or if you mind the psycho analytics then you'll be annoyed to no end br br but you should not be as the setting clips the way the film interleave with these clips zizek's points are never boring
<START> just finished watching can't say i was impressed br br it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's br br as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess br br with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren't br br so the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster aliases scarier
<START> such a delightful movie very heart warming one can't help falling in love with the character of gigi he's adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist the whole movie revolves around him he lives in a wonderful world Â living all life Â curiosity desire and anticipation there is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life the father is very stereotypically italian and so is the mother i wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene Â and have them cry and laugh i also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother his personality seems to have been trashed entirely passion and ardour Â that's the key to life and looking through the camera Â focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life
<START> typical troma trash this smutty 80's flick is considered one of the highlights of lloyd kaufman's notorious production studio alongside the toxic avenger released one year earlier the toxic avenger is far superior if you ask me but this demented splatter flick is nevertheless endurable as well just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door the events take place in tromaville a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and they certainly aren't lying the safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard to say the least even homer simpson never was this nonchalant and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school the first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house oh the humanity shortly after however the nuclear leaks also affect the school's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy after smoking a joint at a party the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum class of nuke 'em high is bottom of the barrel horror film making with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless if you enjoy watching faces melting away getting crushed or splitting in half this is definitely a must see unlike the aforementioned the toxic avenger this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens like for example when chrissy and warren try to figure out what's wrong with their hormones the crude humor isn't as effective as in toxic avenger and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish proceed only if you're an avid troma fanatic
<START> i have seen already fantastic stories but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among say souls maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son there is no shade of suspense or thrill just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life br br this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume fabulous jessica alba and super gifted lena olin all would have deserved a better story
<START> ben thomas smith plays an irs agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise what kind of irs agent is this br br most of us have all heard the line by an irs agent hello i'm from the irs i'm here to help our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says yeah right br br as you get further and further into this story you cannot figure this guy out he goes easy on those who are being audited what is his motive is he from another planet an angel a rich guy who wants to do good he helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited of course hey irs are you listening kidding just kidding br br the pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on intense repeat intense focus was on ben and stays there the whole movie only works because of ben as we try to figure him out and i didn't see any clues what clues you talking about willis not reading the box before watching the dvd movie was the better way to go here by the end of the movie i finally put it all together well it was obvious by then and yes it's over the top but still a great story mostly because of will smith br br will smith should have been nominated for a best actor award the rest of the cast were very good as well br br yes it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong what's the message believe me you will won't need too many clues to figure it out i didn't br br violence no sex yes but nothing to get excited about bland nudity no language no
<START> this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them it's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail as in sabu's subsequent movies i didn't see unlucky monkey yet but the other ones are as great failure chance and humanism play great roles the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic without the movie being an art picture but a highly entertaining one when comparing it to run lola run you have to keep in mind that dangan ranna was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as 1997 so it's more probable that it served as inspiration for tom tykwer's movie and not the other way around complementary to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much this movie is a lot of fun in many ways and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious
<START> john pressman micheal 'i shoulda called ditech' lerner works at a doctor's office as an orderly his mother zelda 'poltergeist' rubenstein hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him but this turns out to be a movie within a movie but the lines soon blur as john goes a movie theater to kill prompting a guy who's watching the movie to do the same lerner is suitably over the top in this but zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again that gets annoying fast but not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie as a horror film this one fails it's too busy trying to be clever trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension or at least a jump or two no what we have here is the worst kind of slasher an art house one br br my grade d
<START> oh come on people give this film a break the one thing i liked about it was sorry still thinking oh yeah when john wayne came and shot up the the bad guys oh sorry wrong movie i was thinking of a better quality film let me see now i'm still trying to defend it oh yeah the chick that was from clueless was in it don't put down stacy dash i mean we all make mistakes but boy stacy you made a dooooosie br br hey one thing that has never been done in a western even an all female cast they actually hung a woman from the gallows that might be a western first even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal still you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first also i've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western although that didn't happen in this movie i just thought i would give the director another idea for gang of roses 2 which should be made right after ed wood's bride of the monster 2 maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for orginality especially with an all african woman cast and an oriental cowgirl br br heeey if the makers of gang of roses want to make a sequel to this mess you could have such slang like hey don't you be takin about my homegirls and talk to the hand baby talk to the hand you could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like that gunfight was totally rad man totally you know things like that
<START> this is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it the dialogs are close to perfect which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play the actors are simply giving their best the story is simple and attractive 88 minutes of pure bliss br br yvan attal is totally credible in his role sandrine kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde but not so dumb providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears jean paul rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total jerk and proud to be such and marina fois is the dumb friend who is always blundering when you expect it least br br thumbs up to bernard rapp and associates for adapting this excellent play and all the best for future productions br br i wish there were more of these in nowadays production if you liked it you will also probably enjoy un air de famille and cuisine et dependances both were written and played by the couple bacri jaoui
<START> ben a out of town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice but he's approached by stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult so ben his sister's best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil br br this is incredibly awful b grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released it makes the original 'howling' look like a masterpiece what was christopher lee thinking as this has to be his worst performance i've seen br br there was a lot wrong with this real cheap ass film ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie mcenroe reb brown marsha a hunt and sybil danning not to forgot lee cheesy fashion those sunnies cheap and lame special effects bad use of lighting the humour if there was any trashy 80s music with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing werewolf's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny but i was wrong br br the positives were the location and settings of the film looked great but that's about it actually i'll add sybil danning short stripping scene too br br during the end credits the band plays their crap house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film which i beckon the question why br br an awful piece of mess however at least it isn't boring br br 1 5
<START> i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight so needless to say i can easily relate to polanski's the tenant br br but i also enjoy the film for other reasons i'm not sure that it works on the whole the polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre ebert for one was totally unconvinced and he slapped the movie with a vicious one star review but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though i don't quite understand the whole film what does egyptology have to do with it for example i still have an overall positive impression of it br br i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard fresson for example god how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all i love the movie theater scene the funniest making out moment in the history of film i'd say and boy do i love isabelle adjani she's so foxy in this movie it's almost unbelievable and she gives a great performance as always br br polanski is a good actor too i don't agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here his character is supposed to be low key and thoughtful so his low key performance fits i for one found him perfectly sympathetic though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason br br yes the movie's obscure and slow but it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living something i've done entirely too much of so i dig it it's funny how all you need is a common reference point and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant definitely worth picking up for pocket change on dvd
