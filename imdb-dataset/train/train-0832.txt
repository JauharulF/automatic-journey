<START> just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film i decided to write another review i missed a few things out last time br br first the script second the acting third jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax br br i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something br br are you getting the picture
<START> a scanner darkly minority report blade runner sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow Â if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out br br french animation project 'renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm my spontaneous reaction is awe my further reflection is 'huh neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh' it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent as do the flat characters br br nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface the visuals are staggering they have used live action motion capture fitted into key frame animation with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background for those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo' the film looks like a fully animated sin city its fluid transparent dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning it's a vision yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons suspenseful music heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking it's every tech nerd's wet dream br br the film zooms in on an eerily lit bleak futurescape paris in which a major corporation called 'avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance think the fluid transparent screens from minority report and genetic engineering the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona voiced by the lovely romola garai cut to our hard boiled cop on suspension and protagonist karas daniel craig Â a man who takes the law into his own hands Â who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona during this case he is being aided by illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair a very half assed love affair if i may say so br br the world of renaissance is remarkable director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads rats femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled out archetypes in the story or the film would have been too surreal for mainstream audiences owing to its lurid animation format it follows then that we have a multitude of clichÃ©d characters such as evil laughing villains sleazy crime bosses and butch tough chicks who blow smoke every chance they get it shoves noir in our faces and it isn't necessary br br what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no nonsense attitude to his hard edged cop character at one point in renaissance he is seen in a vivid car chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline pumping and top notch sequences of the film unfortunately the novelty of the sci fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter in summary a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience br br 7 out of 10
<START> the movie is steeped in religion so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it in my opinion this movie pretends to explore deep issues but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices with little true insight what the people in the movie and therefore the writer failed to see was grace they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful and both the man the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty is just an oversimplification such stereotypes really don't exist for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh and that no man ever hated his own flesh but he nourishes and cherishes it even if you want to ignore the new testament the writers characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament and the even the book of proverbs which says rejoice in the wife of thy youth let her breasts satisfy you always how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows and approves of and smiles on the marital union and the enjoyment thereof real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo christian religion god never said those things it's absurd sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham it didn't need to be so how sad what sonia desperately needed was truth not tradition in knowing loving and obeying god we love others more before ourselves that is the faith of the god of abraham isaac jacob joseph once for all delivered to the saints bought paid for by jesus christ the righteous but alright ignore all this and abandon ancient holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people ghosts that's a good plan i would never recommend this movie partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight check out yentl if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society
<START> freddy's dead did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film it started from scratch sure this final film in the saga is silly but at least it's original some of the visuals are even a bit breath taking and the story of freddy's kid lisa zane returning to town to face her evil father is unique br br overall the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater it has a bunch of good actors zane yaphet kotto and lezlie deane who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter it's one sided it's a magic trick and in the end it's nothing but goofy childish entertainment br br
<START> johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense but that's the point right br br the cast is likable michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed griffin dunne peter boyle joe piscopo marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri sneaking the word iceholes into movie history as a mobster who fares best at murdering the english language br br i associate many childhood memories with this film as i watched it quite often so maybe i'm prone to enjoy it more than many others johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking and sex br br i like it but it's hard to recommend br br 7 out of 10
<START> than this what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie this movie starts with a touch of brazil when at a certain point the story moves straight into the twilight zone bringing up nothing new but just nothing and nothing is great fun when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable bouncing heads well yes br br anyway this movie was imho the biggest surprise at this year's fantasyfilmfest br br just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic weird but very special design which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time timeless somehow
<START> 1958 the sleepy small southern town of clarksburg evil sheriff roy childress the almighty vic morrow in peak nasty form cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael mccord a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen shows up in town in his souped up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother sheen's real life sibling joe estevez in a brief cameo director richard t heffron working from a taut and intriguing script by richard compton the same guy who directed the 70's drive in movie gems welcome home soldier boys and macon county line relates the gripping story at a brisk pace neatly creates a flavorsome 50's period setting and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between childress and mccord the uniformly fine cast helps a lot sheen radiates a brash james deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie stuart margolin as a folksy deputy nick nolte as amiable gas station attendant buzz stafford gary morgan as buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother lyle janit baldwin as sassy local tart sissy britt leach as stingy cab driver johnny and frederic downs as the stern judge j a hooker the climactic vehicular confrontation between childress and mccord is a real pulse pounding white knuckle thrilling doozy terry k meade's sharp cinematography the well drawn characters for example childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident the groovy syncopated score by luchi de jesus and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made for tv winner
<START> i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didn't care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldn't imagine what mr rochester saw in her br br that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didn't hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the production br br the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 a e version which is not all that true to the book br br trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role
<START> many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted that may be so but the addition of the narrator and dr suess like scenery makes this show a must watch with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set the show is both reminiscent and invigorating the investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more this is a success that abc should never let go of bravo abc lost was getting old way to revitalize prime time 9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more
<START> the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock br br the lame ness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be he does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember br br anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok mathematically here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that math its not even connect the f k g dots this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense br br it just goes to show when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail i can't wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama they'll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbers br br totally ludicrous tv show
<START> film makeovers of old tv shows seems to be the norm in hollywood these days but this disrespectful toilet humor do you kiss your mother with that mouth foul language rip off is a blatant middle finger to all dukes of hazzard fans both north and south of the mason dixon line from the opening sequence of bo and luke duke making a moonshine run for uncle jesse no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation to the closing sequence of uncle jesse smoking weed with the governor of georgia uncle jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult i can't tell you how many parents i saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived the original dukes of hazzard was a family show with basic moral values the original dukes of hazzard was a kid safe hemi powered show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids george carlin's seven words i have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist those commits might be correct about the movie those commits are absolutely incorrect about the show the show if anything was about how to get along and be friends with anyone hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us yankee rebel or otherwise who still believe in honor loyalty trust family and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid uneducated beer swilling foul mouthed trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell prove the hollywood elitist that they are wrong do not go see this movie boycott the sponsors fill warner bros email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest t v shows of all time save your money and buy the dvd's of the original show but whatever you doÂ do not go see this movie
<START> the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light the humor is always medium gauge never unfunny but never gut busting the story is a very simple thread the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight laced glass wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other's lifestyles i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it wasn't it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience br br i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it's a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know forget calling them real that's not at all what i mean what i mean is that though pierce brosnan's filthy womanizing boozing hit man is a detached comical character he's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air greg kinnear's character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and automobiles told stalely over again its truly saying something br br the film's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other strangely the matador is a film about regret and loneliness brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we don't understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life it's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more down to earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption the very last scene of the movie stays with me it i think is where the film's subtle side stepping impact finally begins to seep
<START> fever pitch has many of the clichÃ©s we have come to identify with hollywood romantic comedies a relationship between two people with little in common the secret he's been hiding that she discovers the inevitable breakup and the very public Â well i won't go any further but you get the picture in spite of its predictability it works especially if you love baseball as i do though i'm not quite as obsessive as ben wrightman a boston schoolteacher played by saturday night live comedian jimmy fallon br br adapted from a novel by nick hornby by veteran screenplay writers lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ben is a lifelong boston red sox fan whose uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he's been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women ben is not just a fan but a fanatic who travels to fort meyers florida each winter for the red sox spring training games and never misses a home game during the regular season his family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a red sox museum to visit br br when he falls for business consultant lindsay meeks drew barrymore he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but ben is not quite ready to do that he would rather attend the yankee series than go with her to baltimore to meet her parents or to go to paris with her and miss the anaheim series it takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving for him to stop and think about his priorities especially when a pint size dr phil wannabe asks him you love the red sox but have they ever loved you back while the premise of fever pitch is that some things are more important than baseball perish the thought you would never know it from the way things turn out of course to any one familiar with the history of the boston red sox it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans but this is 2004 the year the curse of the bambino came to an end and as the red sox move to a new level ben might just do the same both lead performances are excellent and the farrelly brothers even manage a pretty gross gag while fever pitch will never be mistaken for an art film it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures go blue jays
<START> it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasn't a rental so that i could put it in the microwave i can't say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman 4
<START> i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters renaissance br br and firstly that it looks as it ought to look a boys' adventure renaissance is the tale of a cop's investigation in search of a missing young scientistÂilona tasuiev the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company br br the tale of karas ilona and bislane is though much less known than sin city the better movie and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful i have enriched my french comics collection last week though i'm not so upÂtoÂdate the atmosphere the music the characters their lines the plot are all nice and endearing a parisian top cop karas is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalÂgenetic research ilona tasuievÂa mildly hot blonde whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable i guess br br for me an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series renaissance a marvelously beautiful cartoon was like a replay of a wild wild west episodeÂhere a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futureÂmore jaded and blasÃ© but in a sense as thrilling renaissance is not suspenseful nor does it look especially wellÂpaced but it's seducing and hypnotic moreover it achieves sketching albeit briefly a world a true worldÂand we will think about the avalon nakata jonas mueller the tasuiev sisters and goran farfella and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah Â i liked renaissance's feel of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness and also the professional assured look among these new cartoons this one and linklater's dick adaptation the only and first dick adaptation ever stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement br br i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and when not conventional vividly eerie like the invisibility costumes br br as advisable the characters have exotic names like bislane and farfella mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment's world goran and ilona and naghib Â br br none seems to have noticed that renaissance's poster features a rourke look alikeÂthat guy is marv which doesn't make it a sin city rip off but not a paragon of originality either and in fact there's more resemblance to the miller taleÂnamely the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society the brio of the hero in fact a cross of willis' character and rourke's persona in the previous movie Â Âon the other hand this cartoon breathes a more public air a brim of straight adventurousness and in a word it's like sin city for kidsÂwell naughtier kids i mean 'cause there's a bit of nudity on display to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic even as clichÃ©s and common places of the futuristic more adult comics' look true enough and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there now it's also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn so to each sin city its renaissance i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales a rather undemanding specialty
<START> the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son who likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan s song of a dying country
<START> spoilers all too often hollywood's shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text films including branagh's henry v and 1993's much ado about nothing are powerful pieces of work watching love's labour's lost therefore it's such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste sadly love's labour's lost is awful the king of navarre alessandro nivola and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france alicia silverstone and her entourage arrive soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the prince's mind br br from the start you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by ken branagh the plot is still there and the script remains but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste classics like the way you look tonight let's face the music and dance i'm in heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just don't belong here br br aside from weak singing we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles br br the main eight actors four men four women are all equally dire and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spall br br in fact only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that's the consistently magnificent nathan lane lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costard br br there's little else to be said really love's labour's lost deserves mild praise for branagh's original take on an old tale unfortunately though that's where the positives end weakly acted performed sang and constructed love's labour's lost is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made a poor disappointing choice by branagh and here's hoping his next effort is better
<START> while there aren't any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or villians with half white half black hair it does have 1 thing realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance and walt roy did in their eras with the studio if you thought think the castaways or the island at the top of the world weren't identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon
<START> as i sat in front of the tv watching this movie i thought oh what alfred hitchcock or even brian depalma could have done with this chances are you will too it does start out intrigueing a british park ranger living in los angeles collin firth marries a pretty demure brunette woman lisa zane whom he met in a park only a short time ago then one day she dissappears the police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and firth conducts his own search so far so good just as he's about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend billy zane and they stumble onto her former life in l a 's sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability at that point firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart none of the characters from lisa zane's past are remotely interesting the film moves slowly and there's very little action there is a subplot regarding missing drug money but it's just a throwaway no chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters one thing worth noting lisa zane and billy zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together by the end of the movie you're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake
<START> having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city jim blandings cary grant finds a property in the country for his wife and children he's hoping to find the simple life but building a house proves to be anything but simple as the headaches and the bills start piling up so do the laughs will mr blanding's ever get his dream house br br what makes this movie so special is the three main actors grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own so when you combine their talents almost every scene is special grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role he is so good at playing the put upon husband loy is a always a joy to watch the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years douglas also appeared in the old dark house a particular favorite of mine br br the movie is definitely a product of its time i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two story three bedroom four bathroom house on 15 000 income a year throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid and it becomes almost fanciful br br however for anyone who has bought or built a house many of the situations and predicaments the blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today and that's where the comedy comes in how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected the biggest complaint i have about mr blandings is the whole wife in love with best friend subplot it's really not necessary to the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented
