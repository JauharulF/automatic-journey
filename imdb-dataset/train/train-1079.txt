<START> it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene that's eerily reminiscent of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree producer elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye co producer arnon milchan co produced the oscar nominated l a confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavy handed unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter
<START> i have to agree with cal 37 it's a great movie specially for the family kelly linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course jim belushi has earned his strips but want i really liked was the piano song if you're a musician or not watch this movie just for that you'll know which it is br br you're nobody till somebody loves you written by russ morgan larry stock and james cavanaugh br br so have fun watching br br see ya br br nelson
<START> great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good comedys this is nothing i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking it's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch i like the movie overall so i give it a br br still a good 7 10 for me
<START> me and my friend rented this movie for 2 50 and we both agree on one thing br br this is the worst movie ever made br br also me and my friend counted 475 face shots which makes up 95 of the movie br br so in other words do see this movie unless you like wasting money and i do br br
<START> there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now it's just a classic and offers much more of the story than others do timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester rarely missing the mark his performance is astonishingly nimble and many colored while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character zelah clarke's jane is more cerebral than otherworldly but she makes a perfect foil for dalton who appropriately towers over her the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing once you've absorbed the shock of dalton's charisma there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better though this pretty much was a top of the line production by the bbc's standards of that time but it's the performances that are the real pleasure don't miss this one
<START> american pie beta house is sort of in limbo between genres on the one hand it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes on the other hand it's porno that's a tad too soft core to actually turn on any viewers essentially beta house is a collage of sex scenes some humiliating others just lame attempts at humor with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness the characters are barely even two dimensional most development relies on knowledge of naked mile and the important plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story br br in all fairness i did not go into this movie without expectations i liked the original three american pie movies and thought band camp and naked mile were solid rentals i thought naked mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters and so when i saw that some of the same characters were returning for beta house i was excited to see this installment i was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms and i was fine with it because in the past these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot in beta house however it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other ap movies worked they spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story br br this movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one dollar rental the jokes are lame the story is non existent and the porno aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing
<START> this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons the co ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end where williamson says to ginty you sure do get around buddy boy i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad libbed most likely a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing
<START> where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of neil labute's latest attempt at film making br br there are many kinds of film fans out there but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr intriguing you know mr intriguing don't you br br he's the fellow that no matter how stupid lame and incomprehensibly dull a film is he says gee i don't know why everyone hated it i found it intriguing he's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing especially when he smears it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to greek mythology he's also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for no one else could stand it
<START> the imdb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain 'spoilers' br br well this whole film is something of a spoiler a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against a tale of lost youth that doesn't know where it itself is going br br i just saw this at the tribeca film festival this film wasn't just bad it was really bad br br the acting is inconsistent the characters are the mostly clichÃ© offerings with little depth and farnsworth's acting was very bad in particular br br from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place 'graphic' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios it sucked the big one br br i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy updated 'drugstore cowboy' with a touch of 'natural born killers' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking outside of some frat level gore as the ladder br br more than anything someone needed to really a edit the screenplay br br there are some things in there to build on and clearly br br deals with a worthy subject if ham handed in it's attempt b edit the film if it was cut down to a core it might be passable br br i would go lower than 1 if i could like maybe zero kelvin
<START> nothing positive to say meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message new russian post soviet films can be very good cuckoo comes to mind yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos nochnoi dozor would be a good example this is a dozor type of emptiness acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky would someone please realize that blair witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame and takes are geared towards attention deficit pre teens who subside on counterstrike and masturbation the female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach although genetics aren't bad rather expressive eyes one middle finger for this irrelevant pile of non art anyone who reviews this positively better be a distant cousin of the auteurs
<START> my wife and i have watched this movie twice both of us used to be in the military besides being funny as hell it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy enlisted man and tells it like it really is we're adding this movie to our permanent collection
<START> this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is sure it has some extremes but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life stereotypes and social structure unlike most greek films that have a certain fast food mainstream audience this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film br br if someone told me to say something against this film i'd define the following sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres br br anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend a must see
<START> this film has the look and feel of a student film project yeah there are some interesting albeit gimmicky edits and shots but the end result was juvenile br br the director didn't seem to be saying look at this film it seemed as if he were saying look at me i'm a director br br thumbs down
<START> first things first this movie is achingly beautiful a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter compositor the visuals blew me away every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story well it's okay it's not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic blade runner esquire tales and who doesn't then you will be fine br br i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole i saw it at the cinema in english but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere br br definitely worth seeing
<START> seeing this movie was the most fun i've had at the cinema in a long time however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied this picture has everything any movie could ever have it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist self conscious art film it's all in there adding up to a myth br br the basic premise is about an indian couple nandini karishma kapoor and shekhar sanjay kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice br br the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including shah rukh khan's dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance br br karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion another notable presence is nana patekar who plays narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar nana patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character br br the movie is not without its share of realism violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic br br i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm but shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book perhaps the all important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching shakti exhilarated making movies can be the most fun in the world
<START> this movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film you've got future snl and sctv stars in their prime such as john candy chevy chase laraine newman al franken tom davis and joe flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse uninspired fart and racist jokes the concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes but instead right out the gate makes a lame juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty groove tube or the later hilarious kentucky fried movie this movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy movies
<START> i want cÃ©line and jessie go further in their relationship i want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached this is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie this is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling this was so clever and touching i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there i want to go to vienna i want to see them as soon as possible again br br i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happen br br i'm french and didn't know very well july delpy despite kieslowski three colors white now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting br br i saw before sunset the sequel in paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter they are both masterpieces proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings i'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best br br franck in france
<START> i really did like this show once upon a time that is until i realized all the faults in it it's so unrealistic i know it's fiction but it isn't even the slightest bit believable here's why spoilers ahead folks are we really supposed to believe that a kid like yugi would be descended from a pharaoh of ancient egypt c'mon he's the biggest nerd on the face of the earth and what's up with the pharaoh a k a atem and or yami's hair last i checked pharaohs were shaved except for a small bit of hair atop the head and wore fancy hats br br and are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius named seto kaiba can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like 'domino high' puh leeze first off he'd have to legally be an adult to run a company and that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius since he'd be the only adult in his class and second off why would he attend a school like 'domino high' when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy plus the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame every time you turn around that kid's been kidnapped by goons for the baddie yawn nothing new nothing new br br joey is the poor kid who lives with a good for nothing father it says that joey earns all the money to attend his school because his father's an alcoholic but you never once see joey do anything that resembles work he doesn't even mention work and his sister serenity is a complete moron why would she choose a snob like duke who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television over a nice guy like tristan is she really that clueless various characters throughout the show get possessed by demonic forces get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illness oh that's child safe not tea is the typical girl next door type whose only purpose is to be yugi yami's girlfriend and while she has some cool points to her she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character br br the animation is simply awful all the characters look sickly and anorexic the perspectives are terrible especially when they do close ups of somebody's hand and the colors look good but not stellar br br but the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that yami says that his millennium puzzle can send souls back to their bodies if this was so how come he didn't save yugi's grandpa in the first place when pegasus stole his soul and save himself the trouble of getting it back br br all it really is is a commercial for itself the only plus side to it is yu gi oh the abridged series by littlekuriboh br br please do something more worthwhile like watch the abridged version br br 1 10
<START> this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert duvall's and james earl jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline or lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie well an actual movie not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling senile drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazed amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasn't even a story the entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time that's it it was one day in the life and death of some southerners on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day other than the movie training day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie if you can even call it a movie
<START> i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time darklight br br the gist of the film lilith was adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam's equal and refused to submit to him see i took those words straight from the script then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do she ends the film under the control of the faith an all male group br br other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film there was nothing original about darklight
