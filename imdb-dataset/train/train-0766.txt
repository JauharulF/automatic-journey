<START> this movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas capped by such statements like we all create our own reality br br sorry folks reality is what true for all of us not just the credulous br br the idea that anything's possible doesn't hold water on closer examination if anything's possible contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible this leads to postmodernistic nonsense which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas well founded and stupid are equal br br to quote sci fi writer philip k dick who put it so well reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesn't go away
<START> what a great film it is the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky the ending is not just a fitting one it's more inspirational br br but i am intrigued by the characters it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety their romance is very enjoyable br br
<START> lock up your daughters is one of the best high spirited comedies i have ever seen br br it is misunderstood since it lacks the social commentary values that many films of the day 1969 required to be successful br br the characters are over the top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors br br christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington a noble with hair too big to fit in the door br br the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff mistaken identities thwarted romances corrupt government officials and jokes at every turn br br it answers the questions what happens when 4 rambunctious eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town and who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out br br despite doing poorly at the box office it has great costumes excellent music based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name great lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic br br that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame since so many bad movies are released every day
<START> this is a true 80's movie back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays and that makes many of them quite interesting it was a cultural phenomenon that don't exist anymore nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straight to video movies in the eighties are doing cheap porn porn seems to sell anyway this is above the medium trash movie level it has good fascinating story and it's quite well made i think in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons but they don't very much contribute to the film success although they are good in their small roles the monster heavy singer sammi curr looks really terrible especially when he's singing one of the scariest monsters i've seen in horror flicks i may have nightmares of him next night not recommended for intellectual movie lovers
<START> i'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized it's a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after it br br design some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life they just didn't work mostly because the very same mistake most 3d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didn't work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic it just didn't have the feel of a material that dolls are made of that's what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a 3d shoot'n'run computer game i don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen don't know about you br br animation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9 it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average 3d animations i saw and that doesn't add to it any good br br and all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development we've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and 9 is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters don't even have time to get into the story they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on it just didn't work there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story br br acting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no don't do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop ahh and ohhh and ehh and oooh and whatchout and run and ohohh that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed br br conclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
<START> painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters two of the main characters cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable it wasn't worth the wait i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view
<START> this movie was not made by who fans most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over in christmas they didn't show daltry's screams after the line tommy doesn't know what day it is they showed almost no townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror and worst of all in the second half of we're not gonna take it listening to you they robbed us of almost every shot of pete's blazing guitar chords huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band it's a very frustrating film to watch and doesn't deliver the goods i don't know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan or worse for him at least if he is a who fan and this is all the eight cameras could deliver for him to its credit there are some rare numbers before tommy as well as some faves that are very well shot and sometimes the editing is brilliant this might be enough to make some viewers happy as long as you're not anticipating tommy the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv it may be different on video or dvd
<START> i'm sure that most people already know the story the miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits the ghosts of christmas past present and yet to come who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite br br while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school george c scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing david warner is a good bob cratchit as well br br this version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles for the 1980's which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version br br this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season
<START> you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie making between 1985 and 2000 he made a whopping 34 films unfortunately if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by they're probably all crap and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch br br part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead who have escaped from a top secret army base located directly beneath their school working from a dreadful script by brian eklund which relies heavily on liberal use of the f bomb director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind numbingly awful performances from his talent free cast dreadful visual effects some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space shuttle and his trademark shoddy gore handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing br br finally after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards zombie armageddon finishes with a time travel paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film honestly once was enough mr sheetsÂwhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again
<START> a terrible movie containing a bevy of d list canadian actors who seem so self conscious about the fact they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable br br this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so he really has a bad story and script to work with it's not even camp enough to be funny br br i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner and even the sub characters like eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa br br didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind br br learn from the mistakes of others don't even waste your time with this one you'll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
<START> the year 1995 when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson also saw another very fine yet underrated movie on scottish history rob roy although it is a very different film especially due to the historical period the story is set in rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies br br it is a film that discusses similar themes like fight for dignity courage honor revenge family being a key to happiness it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature robert roy macgregor liam neeson the main character is a true hero so universal in epics sort of scottish robin hood who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords although he worsens his situation through the acts has to suffer a lot two things stay in his mind undeniably honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman mary macgregor jessica lange that leads him to unexpected events br br except for the interesting content and quite vivid action the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images for me the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means then he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman the scene he escapes marguis of montrose john hurt to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual br br of course there is some graphic violence like in the duel for instance but i don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films its justification is like any other epic's bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it the most disturbing scene for me was the rape done on rob roy's wife by the villain of the story archibald cunningham tim roth it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away however all the rest is o k yet there is one aspect that made me really love this movie the performances br br all the cast do perfect jobs from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall brave strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes john hurt one of the best british actors does a terrific job as marguis of montrose a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means i like that calmness of his portrayal but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character archibald a man who mocks love who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter but like in any good epic this exceptional evil must find its end br br and one more aspect the musical score such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect it was as if my second journey to scotland br br rob roy is a very nice movie very well directed photographed and acted it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education i really enjoyed that film do not hesitate to call it metaphorically highlands of entertainment and rate it 9 10
<START> storyline the film spanning 4 odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the kargil sector near the loc in 1999 when the pakistani infiltrators had crossed the loc and had entered deep into the indian territory and the indian retaliation to know more about the story i would suggest readers to read the news items pertaining to kargil br br comment if one is looking for a formula story in this movie then one can be sure that it is absent loc is a story of pure sacrifice patriotism courage and lots and lots of bullets and blood the movie hall where i saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the film shows indian bravery movie audience seemed similar to audiences like in an india vs pak cricket match br br watch the movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real life war heroes 4 pvc honoured heroes who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day the movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions the film's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring
<START> i have never seen any of spike lee's prior films as their trailers never caught my interest i have seen and admire denzel washington and jodie foster's work and have several of their dvds i was however entirely disappointed with this movie if this film is any indication of spike lee's ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others br br i wonder if some of the other imdb commentators watched the same movie that i'd seen i can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of spike lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work i only paid 2 50 in a second run theater and still felt i'd wasted my money br br the imdb trivia page says it all br br shot in 39 days how can you expect to shoot a big budget blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time no wonder there was such a weak performance by all br br ron howard was first going to direct the film he may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits br br ok maybe not i'm sorry this film was so rife with pitiful clichÃ©'s implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it hey ron be sure to thank russell good call br br jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks and it showed her portrayal of a fixer who makes people's problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given did she even want to be there br br other peeves br br how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and he'd better keep away or else br br when detective frazier denzel washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him br br det frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me why then in their brief struggle didn't he even try to expose the robber's face that may have gotten the response he was looking for a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification and why did it take steve stevie steve o the robber's accomplice so long to come and help out br br i understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers they had a different agenda and didn't want anyone harmed but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't to them it was a desperate situation why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield is this spike lee's version of ny city or snl's taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up if not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside give swat something to do or send them home br br what police department in this country would have allowed madeline white jodie foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first she had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situation add one more br br why wouldn't the bank ceo christopher plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago screw sentimentality the diamonds he could have sold br br who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100 albanian but yet he himself couldn't speak it sir put your hand down and his ex wife what a schlump she was both were totally unbelievable br br when interrogating suspects why did det frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist i e telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldn't then could then couldn't give me a break br br who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldn't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages br br near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which clive owens hid out for a week where did the materials come from the drywall studs it was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself the bank employees hadn't complained about the smell all week long hello br br after such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robber's hands what kind of references was ms white expecting to get from the bank ceo seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure br br and last but certainly not least what's with the electric glide that denzel did how stupid was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice he looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement cheeee zheeee br br other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directing yada yada yada br br hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not br br
<START> sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion it was building up to be a great movie but then i saw the villain s and was disappointed br br sudden impact was different than the previous installments the plot went a different direction in this movie as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around we also don't see the villain s until later which means less screen time for them which is better for us all br br clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry enough said pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings harry's new assigned boss bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here either way he wasn't any different michael currie is decent as lt donnelly harry's annoying superior i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins the young punk who has a vendetta against harry albert popwell was excellent as horace harry's buddy audrie j neenan was good as ray parkins a famous lesbian around town jack thibeau was well cast as kruger a pervert now for the really bad part sandra locke eastwood's long time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer harry's love interest and paul drake was just horrible as mick br br the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts br br 8 10
<START> this was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs the actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six it was still funny season 8 was the real problem kicked in without topher grace or ashton kutcher the show simply fell apart not too say the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as danny masterson wilder valderamma kurtwood smith debra jo rupp mila kunis and laura prepon don starks and tommy chong are great too left the show it would have the same affect and the inclusion of randy josh meyers didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans i believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent i am going to miss the show i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as that 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it
<START> the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells' classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important bases like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to h g wells' classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
<START> geez as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film and i am glad of it was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great anti gay backlash and i cannot say that i would blame them the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments anti white are blatant and unsettling society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's cast the actions of these people are not acts of desperation but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self
<START> a kid with ideals who tries to change things around him a boy who is forced to become a man because of the system a system who hides the truth and who is violating the rights of existence a boy who inspired by martin luther king stands up and tells the truth a family who is falling apart and fighting against it a movie you can't hide from you see things and you hear things and you feel things that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real violence frustration abuse of power parents who can't do anything and a boy with i am sorry balls a boy who will not accept things who will not let anything happen to him a kid with power and a kid who acts like a pro like he has never done anything else he caries this movie to the end and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60'ies
<START> it's a really cheesy parody of tomb raider and some indiana jones the humor's cheesy and so is the acting but after all it is a soft core movie which is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is the sex which gets me to the biggest problem of all there barely is any of it which makes you feel like you're watching tv at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that's going nowhere in that industry you're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen then just left hanging the one maybe two or one with two parts that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though i personally can't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two if you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting you don't want this if you looking for a good soft core lesbian film you don't want this either
<START> the first home alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90's the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes now comes home alone 3 i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997 he could take care of himself right so what does the director decide to do he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie but please i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it it's not worth your precious time go fold a piece of paper do chores balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap it's better to do then to watch home alone 3 br br 1 10
