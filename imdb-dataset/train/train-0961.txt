<START> all films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place br br in 1894 the lumiere family men father antoine 1840 1911 sons auguste and louis owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper not a small enterprise the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits innovative for that time it was located at montplaisir in the suburbs of lyon france what caused louis lumiere to become interested in building a cinematagraph in 1894 remains open for speculation my suggestion is that the appearance of the edison organization's kinetoscope peep show machine in paris during the fall of 1894 provided the catalyst br br w k l dickson of edison's staff invented a motion picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in february 1893 it was electrically operated using power from from heavy storage batteries this massive machine pumped celluloid film strip newly developed by the eastman company past a lens at about 40 frames per second fps it was ensconced as an almost immovable object in the black maria essentially the first movie studio the kinetescope machines showed staged presentations less than one minute long that were filmed in this studio br br during 1894 louis lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving picture camera he had determined that even at 16 fps on celluloid film the persistence of vision of the human eye brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived his camera dubbed the cinematograph was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps br br the size and light weight of the camera it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event provided there was enough sunlight available in the spring of 1895 louis filmed trick riding by some cavalry men a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water and a number of other scenes in and around lyon using a molteni bulb he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the revue generales des science the images were projected on a screen five meters distant from the lens the screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms at a meeting of professional photographers that same year louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival br br with accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year since each of his films would be about one minute long he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation for one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory photographing the egress of employees at quitting time br br the public venue chosen by antoine who offered himself as the fairground barker for the cinematograph was the salon indien of the grand cafe on the boulevard des capucines in paris it was a wintry saturday night on 28 december 1895 as the first audience sat they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the lumiere factory with closed gates some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of lumiere photographs but then the crank on the camera projector was turned and movement began louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking this film has a beginning a middle and an end in the beginning the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace during the middle the people stream out with many trying to ignore the camera and the cameraman as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them at the end the gates to the factory are being closed br br and this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public
<START> never heard of this movie saw it on dvd great movie perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work no overhyped typical hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors no current quote a list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie brought back memories of my own post vietnam war military experiences it concentrated on the people who were sent to fight as was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service they were regular people too some just weren't cut out for military life i remember a few in my experience to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either but i'll never forget them should have stayed in touch i highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in afganistan basic training is a trip notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training ha ha ha
<START> don't get me wrong i love david suchet as poirot i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the nile everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i don't think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
<START> whatever happened to keaton is what i want to know br br actually i don't i crawled away heaving thinking she must owe half the bookies in vegas or maybe not maybe she was just brainwashed blackmailed and bored to death rich enough to adopt a third world country she somehow had to star in yet another cookie cut clichÃ© ridden drool'athon based on the same character franchise she's been rehashing since 'father of the bride' '91 you'd think she's going head to head with mr bean br br spoilers br br so hubby dax get's fired by obnoxious son of boss his mom keaton leaves his dad after classic row and crashes over with her own dog show in tow oh those little rascals hubby's got cold feet for diaper duty wifey's clock a ticking and hey let's toss in a space cadet as second house guest for good measure all in one day because that's so funny and original wife gets fed up and walks away mom leaves dad for space cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits 86 very long minutes later br br now if you have to have a space cadet he can't be devious as well he can't scheme some excuse for his stayover and if mom leaves dad she can't hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up br br plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover she's got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now and you only get one obnoxious 2 dimensional boss to denigrate another movie killer would be the movie script the space cadet is toiling away at supposedly more lame than the actual one again dejas ad nausea br br liv tyler doesn't seem happy here her voice was weird at times it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it and she's a smart one she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for jersey girl it was disaster prone could happen to anyone dax shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material br br personally it's the director the screenwriters and especially the producers that i would love to see tar'n'feathered before shipped to guantanamo as playthings for the prisoners and that's me keeping this 'lite'
<START> by dane youssef br br coonskin is film by the one and only ralph bakshi is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes as well as a look at life black in modern america modern for the day i mean 1975 paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame br br but this is a bakshi film controversial thrilling and a must see almost by definition alone not just another random shock jock of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock it's by ralph bakshi anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie he has something big to say br br although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation coonskin isn't just another campy knock off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick coonskin wants to be more it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish br br the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre nor does it just indict black people but actually seems to show love beauty and heart in the strangest places br br coonskin tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail break the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the coonskin world alone makes it old fashioned br br one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear brother rabbit preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary the itallian mob is running all the real action br br big name black musicians star barry white and scatman crothers as well as charles gordone the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer something big is happening here obviously br br the movie plays out like a descent into this world this side of the racial divide from an angry hip deep soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand br br bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word sublety this one looks like it's never even heard of the word but maybe a subject like this needs extremism real sledgehammer satire some subjects can't be tackled gently br br bakshi is god dammed merciless here no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed br br the characters here are animated to real all depending on what the mood and situation are the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally br br bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value he always has something to say nor is black face is gratuitously here unlike in spike lee's bamboozled he seems to be using it to try and really say something br br like 99 9 of all of bakshi's films this one incorporates animation and live action usually at the same time bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here all of this technique is all intertwined meshing together while saying something br br somehow this one feels inevitably dated many of these types of films bakshi's included are very topical very spur of the moment they reflect the certain trend for the day but looking back of them years later there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia as well as timeless truth br br even though the music clothes slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule the attitude the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f king ear it is anyone who's really seen the movies the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about br br even some of the of the black characters are a bunny junglebunny a big ol' bear and a fox one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these dirty n s after the death of a cop but for him it's not just business nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks br br the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film of which there are many it plays out like an opera or a ballet br br the promo line warning this film offends everybody this is not just hype proceed with extreme caution br br you have been warned br br by dane youssef
<START> really really i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage horrible in every sense terribly inaccurate in so many ways i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up flying a jet fighter and shooting down aliens it is easier to note the few things that were right my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years it was overacted seemingly pointless plot diversions and had questionable cinematography at times br br x box youtube acupat utilitiesÂ did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004 it's not like you had to do extensive research it was only five years before this movie came out i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an eod squad you would realize how b s this movie is to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous why don't you just throw commando and red dawn in there too i think those might be more accurate br br if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot the historical and factual discrepancies then this movie might just be ok nothing more if you keep on hearing oscar buzz and have to add your own pompous review go right ahead as for me i am writing the director to see if i can get my 131 minutes back
<START> cameron diaz is a woman who is married to a judge played by harvey keitel whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated while i was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why i was doing so because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability nor does the audience really car what happens even the lovely cameron can't save this one on a scale of one to ten 2
<START> this is a warm funny film in much the same vein as the works of almodovar sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted but would i be willing to let my 10 year old son play the part not so sure br br spanish cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude we'd be much better off as a result br br this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'fartman maurice' character as his lover says to him 'most people are embarrassed about farting you turn it into an art form '
<START> surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ one round jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack his girl and the professional boxer the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown even in this early film hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 the final match as a result ends up being somewhat anticlimactic the story though is what carries this film through
<START> this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film br br the movie begins with 12 year old carol and her mother returning to her mother's home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the strangeness carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts as for why her and her mother are alone i'll spill it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict br br the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them not better or worse just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick br br ps if you don't know which side is which the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the usa the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy
<START> the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like grey's anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital it seems like general hospital or a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
<START> so back when herbie made his first appearance i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn now unfortunately i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie if i'm not on some sort of medication and this is another good movie for the medicated there are no major laughs no complex plot lines no difficult twists herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded br br this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis i thought she was excellent in that and i can't say i was terribly impressed this time around aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film perhaps it was elsewhere she looked older than her part and seemed to always be looking for something a party designer togs new place to spend money off set i couldn't see any chemistry with justin long that romance seemed obligatory at best the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy br br it was great to see herbie again and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry i might have worn some just to be loyal his new feature was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver does he now skateboard but whatever we all knew how it was going to end but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home br br what would have made the movie worthwhile have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot at the very least herbie's as good as lassie but clearly that's asking too much why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as herbie goes bananas and the computer that wore tennis shoes when it comes to innovation br br i'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations for the rest of us it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of rear window
<START> madhur from chandni bar started making realistic films which some people called dry br br he made satta which was another realistic though filmy film but a great film br br aan men at work was a formula film by him which flopped br br he returns with his superlative page 3 br br a film which dwelves into the lives of journalists and it's a brilliant film br br the film is well narrated though the half baked romantic portions of konkana could be avoided but that is forgiven br br the entire upendra limaye track is superb too br br while the atul kulkarni track is great too br br the dial between manoj joshi and his friends are funny at first but repetitive at times br br the subplot of bikram tara is brilliant and so is the entire hospital scene and also the final child abuse which shocks you br br the film has a open ended ending which is nicely handled br br madhur does a great job music is okay br br konkana excels as madhavi using her expressions to the best tara sharma is decent except her voice sandhya mridul is good as usual upendra limaye excels in his part as the cop one of the talented actors sadly he isn't used well nowdays atul kulkarni too is good in his small part boman irani is restrained and does a great job rest are okay
<START> the storyline is absurd and lame also sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open i advise you to have a caffeine propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple gore effects why they bring alcatraz in in this case becomes increasingly difficult to swallow all the while i wondered who this film aimed for chock full of lame subplots such as the cannibalism us army captain this is low grade in every aspect btw this movie is banned in germany
<START> strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies i've seen br br a man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp he disappears the old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married br br this movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres which makes it very creepy too br br the cast includes rosemary la planche blake edwards and charles middleton flash gordon as the strangler br br strangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself excellent br br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
<START> andie macdowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie when you enter 40 and have been single for a while or all your life you may feel you are wasting away the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active i liked the quick sexual encounter which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher macdowell her ex student is cute enough still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long br br there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical though for example at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man would a mature police officer the other friend of macdowell allow her friend to do such a sinister act is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car of course accidents happen all the time but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with that was the hardest part to believe for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long br br maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public especially to jealousy women over 40 who are waiting some miracles to happen the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet but if the man continued to live would that last for how long nobody knows nonetheless it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later a year later maybe
<START> the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died don't you dare say that pokemon sucks i don't like it when people say that i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy pokemon including this movie and other pokemon movies so without further ado please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages and also why do pokemon haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies i don't understand they shouldn't do that there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that 1 pokemon is for little kids only 2 pokemon is stupid and 3 people shouldn't like pokemon i think this is why people don't like pokemon
<START> i found grey garden's to be a gripping film an amazingly intimate br br look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea forget br br society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge br br brood of cats and raccoons persuing their own interests rather br br mundainly all the while chattering at the camera br br big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros br br have chosen to document they seem like characters out of a br br fellini film only stranger if that makes any sense old edie is br br almost fully bedridden a pile of papers clothes and dirty dishes br br growing around her little edie is even more interesting she br br prances around the house always wearing a baboushka like br br headdress around her head completely covering her hair we br br never see her hair throughout the film nor do we ever get a hint br br that she still has much at age fifty eight though she is still br br beautiful and full of life br br in grey gardens we get the sense that both of these women's br br lives have become much less than what they once were little br br edie is probably the sadder of the two while her mother in her br br earlier years got married made a family lived luxuriously and br br even made some recordings the scene where at 77 she sings br br along with a recording of tea for two she made decades ago is br br one of the films best scenes edie left her promicing career as a br br model to take care of her ailing mother at 58 she still longed to br br find her prince charming if anything little edie is still a little girl br br full of dreams of glamour and fame and of domestic and romantic br br bliss that have yet to be fulfilled br br highlights of the film include the opening moments where little br br edie explains her outfit to the camera the tea for two sequence br br the birthday party the climactic argument the grocery deliver br br scene and the scene in the attic the whole thing is incredibly br br candid and unpretencious and it's made all the more remarcable br br since it's all real br br i suggest seeing grey gardens back to back with the kenneth br br anger short puce moment the criterion dvd is 35 00 but it's br br worth every penny
<START> having read the other comments on this film i would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total brooksophile i am not br br when looked at by a purely objective observer the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting it is quite difficult to watch the brooks character robert cole is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self absorbed situation to the next and he should never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context no man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like kathryn harrold unless of course he is albert brooks in an albert brooks controlled production br br modern romance has its amusing moments but they are fragmentary and infrequent more often than not i felt as if i were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already it confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person someone who lacks the self discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening br br as most people probably know james l brooks who played the director in this film is in fact what he portrayed six years later he cast albert brooks in the very successful broadcast news james showed us how albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance albert allowed us to see james generally not cast as an actor do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner br br fans of modern romance will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it to you i say there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment
<START> opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
