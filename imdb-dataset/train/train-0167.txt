<START> this movie and yes it's a movie it was shot as a two parter but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema a very well mannered and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it the film is a faithful adaptation of the long banned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov the sets are flawless and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia adding a feel of authenticity where a late 80s washed out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film i won't say much about the plot which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself but the performances are true oscar material special mentions go out to e evstigneev who plays the old professor with such presence gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture he ends up stealing every scene he's in the second of course is creature sharikov who played to horrifying perfection by v tolokonnikov is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter because not only does he exist in real life entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history with all that ensues br br while it's a socio political allegory it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor albeit dark there are many outright comedies which haven't made me laugh as much as this film what's more when laughing at this movie the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement which is always a plus br br there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual bourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the enlightened characters but that's a minor quibble br br sadly this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies it's a crying shame that one of the all round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated which shouldn't be incredibly hard though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation the film's main themes should be accessible to all while we're waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition i'm considering creating english subtitles myself will see how that works out
<START> why did i go to see this film honestly because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the premise the funny trailer his co star jennifer aniston's involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me br br however as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasons br br reason 1 it wasn't funny in a 2hour movie i laughed for about 5 10minutes all together the rest of the time i sat thinking i really should have got some ice cream i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes gem's such as 'the truman show' 'liar liar' 'me myself and irene' 'dumb and dumber' 'the mask' and the 'ace ventura' films then produces in bruce nolan's own words such a mediocre film br br reason 2 jennifer aniston's role was criminally underwritten i mean hello she's been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say wrong br br reason 3 one word clichÃ© br br reason 4 a casual deployment of specifically american references jimmy hoffa walter cronkite 'sweeps week' is a clue to the film's specifically home grown appeal a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education that's a miracle want to see a miracle soon be the miracle god tells bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety additionally i still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles or maybe it just means we have brains br br in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards
<START> there's only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra's character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible c'mon it's shaq and i'd rather see capra in free willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie
<START> why do i watch movies like this other than i have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day i will find a true gem amongst all this dross i can't think one one good reason this movie was dross from start to finish but semi hilarious dross where else but in a bad italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled english like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret x files like organisation dedicated to hiding the truth br br man in black silence is best for us until we are able to prove that the ufos have no bellicose motives br br military type in any event i find your interference abusive br br man in black whoever has to impose his will is br br i rewound the dvd you know what i mean a good half dozen times and i still can't make those lines mean anything sensible my other fave line was br br we can be quite hard on those who contravert our interests br br it's english jim but not as we know it br br the other highlights of this dull plonker of a movie for me were the totally spaced out acting of the photographer character at the start saddled with the worst haircut ever in the history of everything the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglas by some aliens the aliens are most effectively not seen as a pov shot hand held camera with a fish eye lens sort of spooky the first time but used over and over again it lost its power incidentaly if it is a point of view shot it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reason br br the film was set in england this meant the spanish italian set designers put some british number plates on a couple of english cars and put a union jack on our hero's press card and that was about it no other attempt to make it look like the uk at all br br favourite moment when the foley artists didn't notice that characters they were foleying is there such a word were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud crunch crunch noises other than that another total waste of 90 minutes of my life i hope they prove those ufos have no bellicose motives soon
<START> a case of being in the right place at the right time what a fascinating film it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people he gets things done he is accessible and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people mostly the poor and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case just like the iraq war or the war on terror or those missing wmd's or how about the axis of evil people need to wake up and get different points of view stop the neo cons ruling the world go watch this movie with an open mind and make your own mind up then i suggest you see aaron russo's america freedom to fascism it is not the people of america that are the problem it is the government
<START> the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h lawrence's novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoric br br what a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnel br br a revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way
<START> i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story i can't say anything like that about the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible let's start with the story the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse ariel wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name wants to live in the sea ariel was tricked by ursula melody is tricked by ursula's sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters 1 ariel what happened to her no longer the spunky headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasn't as strong either due to either jodi benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted 2 prince eric while he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie like all disney princes somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic to top it off he just can't seem to defend himself and ariel becomes the tough one of the two 3 sebastian say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie because a whiny aggravating little crab just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible under the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad 4 flounder they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now who's the mother 5 morgana she appears to be ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea sound familiar anyway she's a very clichÃ© villain and falls short of ursula's greatness as a villain she epically fails at witchcraft she's not very tough and not threatening at all 6 melody ariel and eric's daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel can't sing her voice is annoying her friends a walrus and a penguin really are not funny or likable and she's exactly the same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip this one don't watch any disney sequel except for lion king 2 this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh
<START> dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate's son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear liz's name see that justice is done br br written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it's attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it's a good film but it didn't excite me that much i didn't really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of br br director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that's the right word however it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe br br with a supposed budget of about 6 500 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it's extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start br br dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation good but not brilliant
<START> german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made br br lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it br br the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face br br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment br br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct 707 on a cardboard wall br br since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn't afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental br br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride br br after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway br br at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty br br unlike other zombies lommel's girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is br br i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist
<START> i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i can't say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy handed but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but something's got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is cimino's heaven's gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbo's deadwood is much superior to mccabe
<START> in his first go as a hollywood director henry brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father son hit man business the film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift family conscious screenplay also by brommell that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre as a bonus 'panic' delivers subtle acerbic humorÂan unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome surpriseÂthrough its bumbling unsure of himself low key star whose ever cool state is enticing especially given his line of work br br the forever great william h macy again captures our hearts as alex a unhappy torn middle aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons a young attractive equally messed up 23 year old named sarah neve campbell whom he meets in the waiting room at a psychologist's office where he awaits the therapy of dr josh parks john ritter to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father donald sutherland built alex whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father strikes an unwise fancy for sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and more importantly to him a good father to his six year old son sammy played enthusiastically by the endearing david dorfman br br henry brommell's brilliant 'panic' is something of a rarity in hollywood seldom seen with the exception of 2002's 'road to perdition' since its conception in 2000Âit weaves two conflicting genres organized crime family drama into a fascinating warm hunk of movie viewing that is evenly strong in either directionÂand it's one that will maintain its exceptional infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come
<START> fascist principal miss togar mary woronov who is lensed by expert photographer dean cundy as if she were ten feet tall has a plan to turn her high completely square complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller riff randell pj soles who lights up the screen she's got a hot bod too who is an obsessive fan of the punk band the ramones pal kate rambeau dey young whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty joins forces with riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is togar's desired mission br br vincent van patten has a hilarious role as tom roberts a success at everything but getting laid kate is crazy about tom if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it clint howard steals the film almost honestly who can steal this film away from soles as eaglebauer the supplier who can get everyone almost anything his office is located in the boy's restroom paul bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riff's when he enjoys a concert of the ramones br br a raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy and i loved it it's like someone just says let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours the film really is anarchy a plot less chaos lovingly adoring the ramones with all it's heart even if they are horrible actors they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film br br the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins to be honest i didn't want the party to end not conventional in any way whatsoever this film just let's loose a frenzy accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate headlines and people just had a good time those i guess were the days
<START> if i could go back even as an adult and relive the days of my summer's spent at camp i would be there so fast the camps i went to weren't even this great they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing the movie cinematography was astounding the characters funny and believable especially perkins pollack and arkin sam raimi's character and sub antics were priceless so who ever thought this movie was lame i have deep pity for because they can't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity i wish i could it was funny intelligent beautifully scripted brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawk good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors rent it see it buy it and watch it over and over and over never gets old 0
<START> the late great robert bloch author of psycho for those of you who weren't paying attention scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid i had to walk miles just to see a movie and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater seeing a horror movie was always unnerving but particularly so when it was as well executed as this one when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape which should always be a last resort i was surprised at how well it held up take the terror test watch it at night alone and then tell me it's not scary
<START> my 10 year old daughter alexandra writes br br i thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from 101 dalmatians i couldn't wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
<START> there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank capra although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the bbc's lauded the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series br br rarely has something free been so worth invaluable while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts the seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are prelude to war the nazis strike divide and conquer the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america br br overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to world war two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information clogged times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last
<START> daniell steel's daddy what a refreshing story this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will defiantly watch every time it's on good story good acting and i hope this isn't a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the kleenex ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or movie's daniell if your listening you go girl give us more
<START> when i refer to malice as a film noir i am not likening it to such masterpieces as sunset boulevard double indemnity or the maltese falcon nor am i comparing director becker to alfred hitchcock stanley kubrick stanley kramer or luis bunuel i am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on i can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason i am at loss to understand as it is however it wouldn't have made much difference if director becker had filmed it in total darkness
<START> i love cartoons they can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot though computer effects are changing that more and more they can push the boundaries of satire 'the simpsons' good taste 'south park' spectacle 'aladdin' or reality 'toy story' there are some good examples of this in 'ice age' such as when we see a motley herd of now extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it's a really fun film sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly laughs br br the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth sid an idiotic sloth and diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe for very different reasons on the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems also popping up throughout the journey is scrat history's unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice caves his opening scene is a classic br br it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good there is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred's eyes br br not a must see but good for a fun hour or so br br 7 10
<START> disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight to video back in early 2003 dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall 2003's dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done it's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkey zero stars
