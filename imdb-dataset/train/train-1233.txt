<START> i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no disappointments instead however i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi 1983 and was brutally disappointed powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor and artistically it fails miserably it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi hurriedly threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music which is incessantly repeated where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode you'll see what i mean what disappointed me the most however was philip glass's soundtrack i couldn't and still can't believe that these commercial sounding new age type drones which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14 year old on a casio calculator were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi all in all a big waste of time my advice forget commercialism watch koyaanisqatsi again instead
<START> this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects for example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her nell then looks across at theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand in the latest version nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened and can anybody explain what nell's final words mean it's about family it's always been about family br br the one redeeming feature is lili taylor's performance but even this cannot save the film catherine zeta jones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth in the original claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion zeta jones however has to spell it out for example by asking nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend br br definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard
<START> harsh yes but i call 'em like i see 'em br br i saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to watch br br yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories e g dr zhivago qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting br br sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery br br i'm sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life's too short to expend any more time on this one
<START> this film was amazing it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love immortality death and happiness and comments subtelly on society on the part of gackt camui the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire kei i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character toshi who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the heartrenching ending
<START> years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him he's also married to the blonde reporter stacie foster who led the rebellion in the first film now a new conspiracy is in the works one that involves look alike droids who frame our two heroes and a corporation looking to rule the world there is no plot to back any of this up and cyber tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by pm pm was a company that specialized in cheap jack action flicks like this which had tons of explosions little story and overall nothing but mean edged action some of these titles have been mildly enjoyable last man standing and the sweeper however cyber tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma less don wilson when comparing the protagonists of similar pm efforts both jeff wincott and c thomas howell are oscar nominees when compared to don wilson another telling sign is that this was directed by richard pepin who has none of the flair joseph merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets then again though both c thomas and wincott are probably more expensive to obtain cyber tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol r there are so many steals from better movies robocop terminator universal soldier to even halloween iii that it's almost as if richard pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action cyber tracker 2 falls flat there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material also stacie foster looks like she could be better with far better material however cyber tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy bland and lackluster as its leading man however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on all there is is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> i have no idea what people are complaining about i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it stone once again delivered a great character she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct she still has those smart but tricky answers although sharon may be 48 years old she looks amazing i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie she looks good and that's that basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it so don't listen to them
<START> i found this episode to be one of funniest i've seen in a long time the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever seen they have truly touched on romero's underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george romero's opinion was on this episode i'm sure it was purely positive keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode
<START> dan duryea a perfectly decent b movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s can't do much with this one young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer when he's sentenced to die his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband after a dazzling opening shot flick quickly settles into b movie formula it certainly looks good but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast including peter lorre and broderick crawford is just a bit stiff based on a cornell woolrich novel and passable for a single viewing br br from
<START> i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film
<START> gregory peck's acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes 4 10
<START> was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about 5 minutes and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar cheri o'terri had scary movie but she wasnt a leading role and will had elf but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with wayne's world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and people's money d d

<START> after all you do not go to an orson welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy ever after starÂ br br you go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first placeÂ br br as usual as well as directing welles wrote the script and he also played the hero Â a young irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his clear eyed trust in the goodness of othersÂ unfortunately for him he reposed this trust in rita hayworth whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the futureÂ she was married without love to an impotent crippled advocate acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant everett sloaneÂ br br there is a youthful romanticism underlying it all and this quality came into exuberant play in the lady from shanghai before the inevitable happened welles escaped Â to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors which has become one of the classic scenes of the post war cinema Â br br welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphereÂ his camera seemed almost to caress rita hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her webÂ
<START> there wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue well br br it brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic br br even today i have nightmares about corn on the cob and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life br br i have to admit though at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home br br for those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims br br this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn believe me i've been there and i have the scars br br watch the film its amazing and educational
<START> when people ask me whats the worst movie i've ever seen its this one its not even close to mst3k level riffing or midnight viewing at a theatre or even as disney channel late night filler the only time i've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world or disney mgm studios in this case was to grab dick tracey's jacket off the mannequin rip it to shreds and ram it down the tour guides throat saying eat this eat this unholy coat of darkness i've never been so mad at a movie not even nutty professor ii the klumps or flash gordon you want pretty colors and cinematography ain't here babe reviewers keep saying oh but its too look like a comic book well to me its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun about as enjoyable too beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch himself and occasional at the other actors hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting to be fair i have only seen this movie once but my pain threshold is that of a man not a god
<START> the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attention br br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this br br heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze dried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed br br unfortunately most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speech making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll br br that said aside from some shaky camera work at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life
<START> this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again it isn't a movie for someone who doesn't have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like chris rock its a perfect movie in my opinion it is really funnny
<START> this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone crushing teeth of bantha who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside br br but all of the star wars good guys especially r2 d2 had other ideas and those other ideas fended off luke's execution in the end most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death br br like in episode iv the death star in episode vi makes its appearance as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion the 20 25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise once it fired the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience br br like in episode v the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons killing at least one of the ewoks but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers br br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader br br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory e g storm trooper masks and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis darth vader now dead is burned on a pyre the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that even with the strong respect of film composer john williams br br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies
<START> darkman 3 die darkman die is directed by bradford may the same guy who made the first darkman sequel too darkman 3 is worse than darkman 2 and is nothing special in my opinion larry drake is no more as a main villain who is now played by great jeff fahey whose character once again wants to get darkman's work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the leadership of the whole city the film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as darkman 2 but i was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from darkman 2 these sequels were made in short time and with little money so these kind of decisions had to be made couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid too the characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying there is no any philosophical depth in the film and this is like a remake of darkman 2 which it still cannot equal darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work and larry drake's ability to play great villain darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches the few positive things in this movie are flashback edits westlake's nightmares and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks and worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two br br darkman 3 is worst in the whole series and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to raimi's original darkman with liam neeson darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense but this last entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel it has some merits as mentioned but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place may is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future br br 3 10
