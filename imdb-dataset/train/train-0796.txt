<START> do not be suckered into renting this movie it has nothing to do with an escape from death row despite the english title i can't think of a single good thing to say about the movie poor acting poor editing poor directing laughable plot and the sound music was so irritating it's a wonder this movie doesn't come with a warning label the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it's historical cheesiness quality they just don't make films this bad anymore
<START> i've long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well lit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
<START> cusack does his best david niven in this one although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it br br when seen with this in mind its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d mn funny' reworking of an under appreciated comedy classic br br hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot interesting choice br br i never knew how soothing montel's voice was until this movie i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs
<START> a few months ago i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster hey kmadden about this film the poster insisted that if i gave 'flushed away' a chance i would like it based partially on that argument i agreed to watch the film br br 'flushed away' has good intentions at least on aardman's part but lacks the strength to pull it all together its best asset is sewer rat boat captain rita played by kate winselt who imo should have been the movie's main character instead of roddy hugh jackman rita's cool tough and interesting while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling br br one of the things that bothered me most about 'fa' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with when roddy gets hit in the crouch the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately my name's shocky says one of rita's brothers who then electrocutes roddy at least three times my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low br br i won't waste time griping about katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar one similar film's a coincidence five's a rip off but i will say i'm disappointed in aardman they can do and have done so much better try harder next time guys
<START> after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah here director duo abbas mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salman's colleague in her apartment salman slapped him br br the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc which are required to make a movie hit but of course for salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him why because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la la la all around his role as a rich young businessman who has no nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive after all madhubala a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that heart touching as it is here of course this can be termed as improvement then priya a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preity br br finally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives but still then it is a doubt
<START> don't get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds james woods and anne archer they are just glorified extra's their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasn't that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing the action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yes this movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an action stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes don't waste your time with this one avoid
<START> after seeing this film months ago it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point br br i fell in love with hal hartley's directing many years ago i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained it is a strange feeling granted and i assume most people out there really just don't get it or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable i guess i just really get it its as if these films were made for me br br although i don't remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film it remains one of the funniest films i've seen in many years if you don't see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church to her brother's publisher's office to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film the bag is a silent character in itself being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her br br i consider henry fool my least favorite of hartley's films i honestly don't remember it very well i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development br br aside from posey's brilliance it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn one of my favorite actresses again her extravagant naivetÃ© is perfect for hartley's direction his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout br br this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story explaining political situations in afganistan this is never suspected at the beginning the complexity of this film's development is unparalleled br br this is the epitome of a stand alone sequel the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film as an alcoholic chain smoking complaint machine hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12 year old schoolyard bully br br although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley's other recent films the girl from monday and no such thing fay grim goes far beyond what i expected with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare
<START> this was a weird movie it started out pretty good a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing br br next comes his down fall here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy b movie poor acting i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop these guys could not after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts br br from this point on it is bad acting big boobs the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes br br that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off br br i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse
<START> zodiac killer 1 out of 10 worst acting ever no really worst acting ever david hess last house on the leftÂ no the one from the seventiesÂ rent it it's really good is the worst of the bunch pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god awful one would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence the film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen br br not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for mr hess to ruin it is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike no post production either come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture the autopsy pictures are interjected the way italian cannibal films interject those god awful real life animal killings and the navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the navy what in the world is lion's gate is doing releasing this garbage it would embarrass troma the plot is about the zodiac killer last seen in dirty harry Â no the one from the seventiesÂ rent it it's really good somebody gets shot in the stomach in la and the cops assume the zodiac killer is back uh huh what can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that dsm iv is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a nambla subplot sign me up
<START> don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives yes it is cheaply made yes the gore is laughable and yes the acting is sub par however this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing its mine then you will enjoy this one there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks for one the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies and last but not least the setting is what made the film for me the makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm however if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down it reaks of possibility when watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did
<START> i remember seeing this when it was released in a theater in palo alto and not expecting much i mean an australian movie but it finally got to me here's a scene richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney facing an australian aborigine elder named charlie br br chamberlain you were outside my house last night you frightened my wife who are you and charlie at a deliberate pace replies who are you who are you who are you who are you who are you are you a fish are you a snake are you a man who are you who are you who are you it's a stunning scene shot all in close ups with chamberlain's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlie's black broad nosed bearded visage br br the two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable almost unspeakable mysteries of charlie's world br br i don't think i'll go on much about the plot it's kind of an apocalyptic tale but i must say whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus they've got everything in here from pointing the bone to the dream time a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real it's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects charly's world simply begins to intrude into chamberlain's dreams for reasons never made entirely clear br br if there's a problem with the script that's it nothing is ever made entirely clear does chamberlain who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines die in the last wave do the aborigines does the entirety of sidney the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying more elegant and beautiful if you like mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b demille's the ten commandments but they're brothers under the skin br br but i don't care about that taken as a film this one is pretty good and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director peter weir and the australian film industry this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes some of them raucous like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like lantana i like weir's stuff which resembles nicholas roeg's in being pregnant with subliminal dread try picnic at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood
<START> who votes in these ratings jacknife is a beautifully acted brilliantly observed piece of work with actors on top of their game especially ed harris and the peerless robert deniro please don't mention marlon brando in the same breath of this man see taxi driver for confirmation of this point is it a 'mundane' movie because it doesn't have sex meaningless action nudity in it this movie is about the complexities of the characters involved ed harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking the part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire while we are on this subject casino 7 8 out of 10 one of the greatest films of all time from one of the greatest directors starring the greatest movie actor of all time with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever only warrants just above average come on
<START> i still have grainy late night no cable cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when late night commercials and all when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on just so i could tape it br br the series wasn't really about freddy kreuger only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serling esquire announcer instead each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood dating cannibalism dating money death dating and hmm dating br br from the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says i will love you forever to the wrong girl and is stuck with her literally at least for a moment they grow together to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man only to find herself in his cabin where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey and the injuries and penalties that go with it dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series br br one episode had jeffrey combs re animator etc as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient not original but still creepy and fun br br even so some of the episodes were great my personal favorite was it's a miserable life where a young man is trapped working in his parents' burger joint when he wants to go off to college stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same no not freddy just a thug with a gun turns out the whole mind blowing episode is just that the last thoughts that pass through the kid's head along with a bullet br br the second half of the same episode many of the freddie's nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories followed his girlfriend who was also wounded but not killed in the drive by and who is taken to the hospital from heck they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichÃ©s and then some from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut or waking up during an operation to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle br br again that was my favorite br br some of the episodes were much dumber like almost all of the ones they've made available on video they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series and then nobody likes them thinks the show stunk and then they don't put any more on video it's a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england but i'm still gonna buy it
<START> finally i've been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere in sb i met a few of the actors who were really nice and who were great in the movie i watched the trailer so many times that i didn't know what to expect but got totally sucked in the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too i recommend it to anyone who's a ryan donowho fan and dominique swain was good in it too the other actors were good also great i hope it comes out on dvd soon br br i first got into ryan from watching the oc and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like imaginary heroes he is great in this film and everything that he does that's indie i also like dominique but haven't seen her in as much hope to see them both in more soon
<START> my favorite memory of this show and the band was when i got together with a bunch of my friends which are nbb haters and had a big bonfire and we took a cd of their songs and the dvd of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing ding dong the witch is dead that was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol god this show sucks i hate it so much get rid of the crappy car you guys really suck you really ruined the whole channel no offence or anything but you guys need to get a life i mean really who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can't even sing you guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something except roselina she's really pretty but still you guys reak
<START> i can't tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete i say that these reviewers have no imagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing dungeons dragons this movie is for you especially if you got into the oriental adventures i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen just more incentive to get my own big screen t v
<START> partially from the perceived need one feels to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950's movie going public br br the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper class bureaucrats running the foreign office the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves but after that the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot terry thomas watchable as always but the great talent in the cast peter sellers et al is largely wasted br br a diverting but not great film
<START> i didn't feel as if i'd been raped like i did with the enchanted christmas but belle's magical world is still the antithesis of beauty and the beast like christmas bmw hates its audience although not to such an extreme degree it's ugly uncanonical idiotic and the writing is horrifically bad none of the stories work these are not the characters we loved from batb at all they're a bunch of pod people i wanted to dissect it but after a few minutes i gave up because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously what we have here are three stories the perfect word is an overbearing ponderous study of forgiveness fifi's folly only works if you can accept that babette's name is actually fifi and that she's a closet james bond villainess and that lumiere is an idiot concerning women broken wing or broken wind as i like to call it is probably the most heinous of the bunch beast hates birds since when don't watch this crap every copy of this video deserves to be cremated beauty and the beast is still a cinematic classic a transcendent celebration of love art intelligence and the human soul
<START> from around the time europe began fighting world war ii until the war's end hollywood with significant prodding from the government made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the army by making the life of a serviceman appear cool this is by far the sloppiest implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work you get the best food and you get to lie around all day listening to ann miller on the radio i am far too young to have participated in wwii but i think that there was more to it than that there is the barest cat's whisker of a plot and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading acts br br i think that by 1943 even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie while i am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment i can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones' sacrifice
<START> saving grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the 'how to ruin an adequate film in the final few minutes' award naturally if you mix a quaint cornish village largely populated by retired genteel ladies with a liberal dose of marijuana a certain amount of silliness will ensue however the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny it is a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998's waking ned devine which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation br br the protagonist of saving grace is middle aged recently widowed grace trevethyn whose husband's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money helped by her gardener matthew she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana unfortunately this leads her into confrontation with the local police her husband's creditors and a french drug baron whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously the relationship and rapport between grace and matthew is well portrayed and brenda blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character you can really feel what she is going through br br the casting of the minor roles is excellent even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric however the transformation of jacques the drug lord into grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all and surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants
