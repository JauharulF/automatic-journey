<START> this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so patently obvious br br oh my god where do i start well here this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my civic duty such is the badness of this flick br br begin digression but let me just state one thing before i start i'm not some harvard art major film noir weenie in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass ave in cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerd who would obsessively love comic book films census group and still i hated this film my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards bond flicks clerks and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that dung heap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on imdb for god's sake so i'm as shallow as they come therefore i'm not criticizing this film because i'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence it's because elektra stinks like a three week old dead goat end digression br br ok there's so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it here goes br br ms garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding nemo the latter was the sexier film you know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice once at the beginning once at the end bummer in the rest she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female lots of pouting and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying oh my god you'd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um wait br br the bad guys gal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit at least next to jgar's performance it doesn't stand out too badly one guy's role is to stand there and be huge another's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people they manage to pull these incredible feats off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guy gal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense br br plot twists this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention let's just put it this way my wife who has only been in the u s for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg's pad and i swear to god i am not making this up she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isn't stupid but she isn't being courted by mensa for her gifts either and she's had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre and she figured this out in 00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information such is the blatant obviousness of this film br br rarely before seen stupidity ok so there's this big dude in the film he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it's lint and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it or something more defenses kicking in thank god but jg jumps on his head and he explodes an achilles noggin ok such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film br br ack i'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if armageddon is going to come please let it be before this comes out on dvd
<START> the underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train wrecks i've ever seen luckily i didn't pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was i love off color comedy i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so i can't hold that against this movie it's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat by batman a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat hilarious simply genius i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean br br p s don't buy this movie
<START> it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as dukes of hazzard and the hills have eyes the new version can find dvd distributors while older and far superior works such as this film are nowhere to be found with all the on going debate about the morality or lack thereof of warfare and interest in espionage consider the multiple jack ryan bourne xxx and mission impossible productions this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd true it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture but style consideration aside this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained if nothing else will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand alone i don't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products but if you are reading this and other comments please take us seriously we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard earned dollars spent on tickets dvds and cds give us what we want all that said if you are reading this and have not seen this film lobby for it's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about you will not be disappointed
<START> great movie enough laughs and action for any audience br br since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film here i am br br the film follows an unlikely duo johansson and allen as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter their search takes them into the home of the killer and eventually to a somewhat tragic end but don't let the plot fool you the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb br br it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right clint eastwood allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers also from watching the movie in a pact theater you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback the second he walked on screen audience lit up there's just something about the man and he really shines in scoop br br check it out it's worth the trip
<START> one of america's most brilliant film directors was without question elia kazan his directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers since kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle however 'panic in the streets' is a first rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released the themes of illegal immigrants people smuggling imminent plagues rapid transmission around the world of diseases a worried richard widmark says 'i could be in any american city in ten hours and in africa tomorrow ' ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today's concerns more than ever this film features a spectacular film debut by jack palance and a wonderful performance by barbara bel geddes two casting strokes of genius richard widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once and is a deeply caring warmly loving intense hero of the people he leads basically a one man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in new orleans struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem there is a race against time to find the small time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours before the whole city and as they are always reminding us the whole country are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu one amazing scene where jack palance who is infected is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all the highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee factory' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of hitchcock and with just as spectacular a setting many non professionals appear in the film which has the gritty realism of well something called reality kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went and where even rats would have thought twice this film was a major feat of social realism if it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers it is because kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up for after all the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls the only unfortunate thing about the film is the title which gives a false suggestion of superficiality but kazan was anything but superficial he clearly considered this project a public duty to alert us to genuine possibilities if only those possibilities had diminished today but alas they are getting worse every day one day after a worldwide plague this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film but its lessons were forgotten
<START> this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie the cgi was awful and the story was just a waste of ink dean cain's character was mr super intuitive i can figure out anything except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly the biggest problem was the split screen camera work i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something only it wasn't different people in the boxes just close ups and different views of the same thing i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasn't worth the film it was shot on
<START> tony scott has never been a very good director but every film he's made after crimson tide seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today michael bay may fall into the same category but at least his big dumb delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level and like other overblown hollywood biopics de lovely and confessions of a dangerous mind for instance chronicling the lives of pretentious overrated or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of mystique by a society that thrives on the juicy behind the scenes details domino is a film that begins with little potential and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty minute mark with an already distended running time of 128 minutes the film feels twice as long and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable unlike the superior rules of attraction scott's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via domino's smug self aware rich girl voice over only draws attention to the film's sledgehammer cluelessness becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable the story spoiled upper crust babe domino harvey keira knightley in an ersatz badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in los angeles and accosts gruff bounty hunters mickey rourke and edgar ramirez to learn a more exciting trade along the way there are double crosses shootouts media attention courtesy of a tongue in cheek christopher walken phoning in his trademark sleazebag and laughable hints at romance scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon drenched nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to watch if scott's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image ghost it or distort it in some way he will but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot characterization and suspense the film has to say nothing for its ehm entertainment value most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical oftentimes both observe the unbearable several minute segment where an african american introduces a new list of racial categorizations on jerry springer and i found myself wishing they would all get the tails end of our protagonist's coin by the end domino is utter unmitigated trash whatever interest in this individual scott hoped to inspire in his audience it is lost in a sea of migraine inducing neon pretension a few minutes in
<START> a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that we've all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment
<START> oh geez there are so many other films i want to see out there i got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted yeah br br i used to watch this show when i was in college it was mindless kinda fun and somewhat action oriented the show had a good heart tho and the characters were cute no one ever got killed or even hurt badly it was like a cartoon come to life cut to 2005 what happened this one doesn't work as others have said there simply isn't a cohesive story and the performances are weird almost annoying definitely not faithful to the original characters the whole thing is a like a mad tv skit and it lasts over 100 minutes this was one of the few times i've been embarrassed watching a film what were they thinking as best i can tell must've been for the product marketing toys etc all i can say is let this one die a quick death it makes the original dukes of hazzard seem like masterpiece theater br br i think the only remake left to do from tv is gilligan's island good luck
<START> a couple janet and richard go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp after camping and enjoying nature the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house soon a pair of escaped convicts show up and after much delaying of the inevitable they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage br br this last house on the left like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers moreover i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone i love caged terror the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty i found the film to be quite creepy br br the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question i do think that it will both most people the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue at least in the early scenes this film takes a little more patience than usual and it's really not for everyone br br in short this was a good film not the greatest horror film i've ever seen but it is certainly a lot of fun it's not exactly the easiest film to find it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough it's not for everyone but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out
<START> fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool i haven't seen the earlier film and i don't know if that's a good thing or not i can only regard the current film on its own merits br br for most people hal hartley's style of film making is something that you either like or you don't his combination of action drama absurdity and dry ironic humour really resonates with me and fay grim is no exception it has an air of sharply written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes br br during the second half of the film the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage conspiracy thriller whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear but i think a bit of editing or re writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum br br the performances were generally good particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum who had the most screen time saffron burrows james urbaniak carl montgomery and elina lÃ¶wensohn all played good support roles the film's visuals were nice set in new york paris berlin and istanbul and the music also by hartley was good without being intrusive the film is well written and i enjoyed this it immensely if you like hartley's earlier work you'll probably like this
<START> it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other ethan hawke jesse tape '01 and julie delpy celine er 94 tv series nicole this gal and guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years jesse and celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film you will feel the same way
<START> after watergate vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras what the world needed was a good old fashioned chapter play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of 1936 or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures unfortunately what it got in 1975 was doc savage the man of bronze perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pal's final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robeson's pulp paperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other we can do better than that and adding a bullwhip a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix br br a big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman Â explorer adventurer philanthropist a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach blonde bulletproof muscle bound body of a greek god or rather the form of tv's tarzan ron ely a rather dull charlton heston clone here there's simply nothing he can't do and more damagingly nothing that can harm him the man is the virtual incarnation of hitler's aryan ubermensch no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany albeit with all american values and just in case there should ever be anything he's overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage the less than fabulous five a chemist an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures in reality doc's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way Â even kryptonite wouldn't put a dent in him there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of paul gleason they're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas scott walker no a different one delivering one of cinema's worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish welsh greek pakistani or some nationality no one has ever heard of while robyn hilton's marilyn monroe ish dumb blonde moll gives paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes br br even with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients Â lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why doc's father was murdered unfortunately it's a question of tone in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes weren't brooding figures prone to state of the art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matinÃ©e market you know for kids there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight faced Â and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post production be it the colgate twinkle in doc's eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust up with captain seas or don black's gung ho lyrics to john philip sousa's patriotic marches Â but plenty was in the film to begin with after all it's hard to see how one of the villain's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while doc's explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam west's batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his adam's apple br br perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them br br still aside from doc's various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously l a standing in for new york while fred koenekamp's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget and it's good to see a superhero movie that doesn't spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himself br br it's a film i'd really like to like more but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened
<START> i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co worker of ruby's ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn't the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie
<START> cashing in on the demons meets clergy trend of the late '60s early '70s that most prominently included the triptych of rosemary's baby the exorcist and the omen the sentinel is an addition that's just as good albeit the most overlooked of the lot in a way it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski's the tenant which came out the same year for good measure a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor the brilliant burgess meredith plus the other off center tenants kept awake by loud noises above her apartment she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building from there director michael winner death wish kicks this supernatural thriller into gear and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine aided by a brilliant ensemble cast a subtle storyline and excellent makeup fx by dick smith the exorcist the sentinel is a genuinely creepy horror flick
<START> this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort
<START> this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime cool title excellent director i saw to die for and drugstore cowboy before this and hey uma thurman in the cast how can you go wrong well that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey br br disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs its critical lambasting was well deserved you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality zero out of
<START> i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a gay film i am not even gay but i don't see it as a gay film it is a film with a gay character i can't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ryan states that he doesn't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone isn't that horrific and sad i highly recommend the film
<START> having read many of the comments here i'm surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called mirror image starring vera miles rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending but in a feature film there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense sadly substance and sense are two things missing from the broken yes it has some moments but they are not enough to justify your time some further observations although this is clearly a contemporary story not one character in the movie has a cellphone and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going there is never any reference to an insurance company to the person who was driving the other car or to the police who would have been required to do a report my advice skip this bore and watch the original instead
<START> i rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters mumble all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time i just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters not even ian holm could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia i'd skip it 3 10 and that's being generous
