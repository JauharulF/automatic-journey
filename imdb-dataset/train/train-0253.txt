<START> this film is awful the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive it is mostly a photo shopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed and i have seen lots of the very bad sci fi channel movies br br aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low cost actors who probably work as waiters waitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing kate the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects at least there is honor among crocodiles
<START> a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do that being stealing from farms and killing prey until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved they are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land br br the film version and i use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them they'll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book
<START> i cannot believe that they managed to spend us 17million on this film spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc unbelievable plot contrivances a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un what not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need now that might have swayed some people into actually listening to them
<START> there's a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie unfortunately several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character so no this isn't the modesty you know from the comic strip currently reprinted in nice editions from titan books this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her back story it's accurate br br miramax had the movie rights to the character with quentin tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser early drafts of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element tarantino wasn't happy with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed to the studio's credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world with the movie rights close to expiration they decided to try a very different approach the result was my name is modesty a small direct to video movie that introduces the character br br the movie does not introduce willie garvin or sir gerald these characters are important to blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories what this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself she never loses her composure and you never doubt that she's in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns most of the movie takes place within a casino which undoubtedly saved money on the production it doesn't matter the film does not come across as cheap instead it gives a fairly comprehensive and believable back story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead should miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her origin i realize the words direct to video don't inspire confidence but this film is well worth a look
<START> even if you're a huge sandler fan please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for 7 99 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the r rating and scantily clad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantily clad women but none get naked i'm not sure what point this was in sandler's career but i'm guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times but we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is no budget movie that's right not a low budget movie a no budget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot it's like an extended sketch comedy show but a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor i'm not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy gilmore's happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if you're curious about adam's early days in film you still won't be interested you're better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role br br this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 cent rental section of your local video store and rightfully so br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> i first read lorna doone about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it it is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days' journey from london and law and order was much harder to enforce sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful why do television adaptations do this why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story one of life's great mysteries the bbc made an excellent version which was televised at christmas in the early 1990s which i am still trying to track down a copy of take my advice read the book and don't bother with this paltry version
<START> the whole point of making this film one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera was to make it more accessible to the masses and it succeeded admirably in doing so the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals a young loren handsome della marra and a slinky ms maxwell who make the story much more believable giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be altogether an enchanting introduction to one of verdi's great works i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera a form with which i was then not well acquainted i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals luciano della marra was a standout as radames and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films
<START> i had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines br br plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy br br a bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie
<START> the pervert's guide to cinema 2007 br br if loving cinema makes me a pervert so be it br br if you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then i'm sure you can't get enough of films about film making and i don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience well if that's the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you br br in sophie fiennes sister of ralph joseph if you were wondering has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive and often outrageous takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing probing and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings socioeconomic political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging determined and near frenetic dissertations to go from explaining how the bates' house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego superego id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman br br although i had no idea who zizek was Â he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese Â with his sibilant tongue and passion the host comes across as a mad prophet br br fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick lynch hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz the red shoes and fight club br br there's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes Â even if they are freudian jungian to a fault Â then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video it's the only way to appreciate it
<START> i got the dvd very cheap and i'm a total drewbie and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone br br an early drew movie she's looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies br br the movie itself is pretty average or sub average and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy br br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected br br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies
<START> oh what a bad bad very bad movie cowritten by and starring sylvester stalloneÂthat should have been enoughÂand featuring too many rock climbing scenes vertigo falling and scene chewing villains and a botched airborne heist there are two plots both lame one involves a traumatic failed rescue and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty and killing various harmless people whenever possible the usually reliable john lithgow perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care bostid in a vague approximation of an english accent janine turner who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot stallone is stolid and muscle headed no deathless lines in this one no living lines either
<START> i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don't believe there is a worse movie in the world br br i hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell br br damn this disgusting waste of time br br i pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination i pray that i dreamt the movie and that i will never have to see it at br br my local video store again br br burn in hell
<START> after watching this movie on dvd i watched the trailer the voice over describes the movie as surreal well there's surreal and there's surreal br br there was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal the other unusual imagery particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning i don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevant br br my impression is that the director was trying to convey logan's inner monologue i don't know what else would explain what was going on unfortunately nothing i saw gave me any clue what logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state all i could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy br br i thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become but not much else did purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision br br still as tiresome and as content free the movie was for me it was a definite change of pace i very much liked madagascar skin and i had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative and perhaps even style it didn't even come close for me there's no question about it this movie deserves an a for effort but a d for execution
<START> it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie that to me and many others is one of the greatest film noirs ever made realizing this is simply a shortened made for tv film and that most people had trashed it i didn't expect much but you can't help but compare this with the '44 film scene after scene i found myself comparing what i was looking at it and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray barbara stanwyck edward g robinson and others now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna samantha eggar and lee j cobb br br when it was all over i found it wasn't as bad as i had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original the two main areas in which this made for tv film wasn't as good were 1 the electricity between the two leads was missing and 2 being only 90 minutes they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot characters and chemistry between those leads crenna and eggar were flat and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as walter neff and phyllis dietrichson respectively br br where this re make held its own was in the other characters such as barton keyes and edward norton cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton head of the insurance company it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed so the houses cars telephones dictating machines etc were all early '70s instead of mid '40s otherwise the storyline was very similar just rushed br br however one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film
<START> i approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised it is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years especially strictly ballroom while the music is nice and the dancing colourful for me the movie is not about dancing it is about the very japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life he is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing also japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted at least eventually by family and audience attitudes to ballroom dancing as conveyed in the film are definitely non western though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to japan the cultural contrasts are thus intriguing even without the cultural insights the colour the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch
<START> i'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for that br br this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7 10 that's pretty decent br br i must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why i'm puzzled this is the only film made by this director how come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha br br anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please
<START> oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesn't make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multi layered characters or attraction it's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a 'movie' i suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all br br take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of i'll give it 2 out of 10 and that's exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating br br and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you
<START> i had high hopes for it when i heard that it was being made back in 2001 because i read the devil and daniel webster when i was a kid and i found it very interesting they made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me daniel webster in the story was a famous lawyer from new hampshire in the story in the movie he is an editor a lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing jabez stone against the devil him herself he was a man in the story but was a woman in the movie in a trial where both of their souls are on the line as an editor it doesn't seem likely that daniel webster would have the skill to do this br br the acting was decent by all except for alec baldwin and dan aykroyd these are two actors that i like they just did an awful job in this movie it was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy this might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind and was then re edited by somebody else given this fact it's surprising that it was at all coherent i was surprised to see a fair amount of snl cast members in the movie which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy br br all in all i would have to say it wasn't completely awful but it wasn't much good if i could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it i would the ending was especially disappointing as in the original story daniel webster defeats the devil in the trial jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie literally we are just brought back to the first scene with jabez and then the movie abruptly ends it actually looked as though they just replayed jabez' first scene over and called it the end there is no indication that jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again and perhaps over and over in an endless loop it was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense the decent cast and the acting of everyone except for baldwin and aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich
<START> deniro is a master one of my favourites and i love good sports movies not into baseball so much but hey its sports movies right i was expecting much more for this movie it seems to start out well deniro is what i expected snipes whom i don't really like is very good as the spoiled star barkin's role to me was ok she's a good actress but seemed out of place in this role to me they always seemed to rush the scenes and then it drags a bit in places it just seemed tio me to be so uneven considering the cast and the plot it could have been so much better i rated it a '4' and i was being generous i'm a tough one with numbers
<START> plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie but follow the fleet 's screenplay is exceptionally mediocre fred and ginger still come off all right they play bake baker and sherry martin dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy when they meet again their love hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments but for much of the movie they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry's sister connie harriet hilliard her love for sailor bilge smith randolph scott bilge's dalliance with another woman and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father though hilliard is rather charming this plot is uninteresting br br but at the same time follow the fleet is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents astaire gets two good solos with we saw the sea and i'd rather lead a band he sings expressively and of course dances electrifyingly and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual rogers sings the catchy let yourself go and later does a solo tap dance to the same tune br br the three duets really save the film even though they're all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of let yourself go later they sing and dance i'm putting all my eggs in one basket as if it were an early rehearsal of the number flubbing the choreography to comic effect at the end the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet it makes it part of a show within the show the situation is contrived but the song let's face the music and dance is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote it's reminiscent of cole porter and the dancing matches it in elegance quintessential astaire and rogers br br it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of follow the fleet again and in fact it's not necessary because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers but i could watch the songs over and over
