<START> am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography but the screenplay was stilted and wooden the acting was fairly bad thought the two female leads were serviceable you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though there were the stereotypes bible thumping reverend without a hint of nuance authoritative captain hot headed soldier etc i am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies i clocked it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be such the telefilm canada end credits gave it away i know i'm a horrible person br br maybe i missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason focus people there's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians that's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them the question of their immortal soul can be resolved later br br also i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy these girls are supposed to be the protagonists one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives i guess one is just a victim of her condition who can't be necessarily blamed for her actions but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy ending
<START> hey everyone br br there really isn't much to say for this movie at all the basic plot is that a guy brandon takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work after picking up a girl on the way there things start going badly wrong for all of them br br the storyline alone written by the actor playing brandon i believe although i could be wrong here is unlikely and unconvincing and is acted out accordingly the clown killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer far from being a dark mysterious but most of all intelligent predator we are instead offered a rather clumsy nursery rhyme singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis the only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things br br in short this film falls below every possible set standard admittedly i was sharing a few beers with a close friend as i watched this so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that s i c k did fall just shy of a two rating however in reality and with the benefit of hindsight the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film br br 1 star out of ten
<START> hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of type casting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human hammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or something br br a group of associates are invited to the scientist's private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero i'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun toting evil doers or perhaps a call to fix someone's pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land based human shark hybrids anyway he's amazing and saves the day he even get's the girl br br the shark man is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace it's complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land based killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter it's rubbish but not as bad as some might say
<START> kurt russell's chameleon like performance coupled with john carpenter's flawless filmmaking makes this one without a doubt one of the finest boob tube bios ever aired it holds up too the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll i'd been a borderline elvis fan most of my life but it wasn't until i saw this mind blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself it was quite a revelation elvis remains one of the top ten made for tv movies of all time
<START> i think that this movie was reasonbaly good it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names it's just kind of an older version of it takes two
<START> since its release in 1983 a christmas story the jean shepherd narrated story of his alter ego ralphie has become a true classic my summer story however still has shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film br br my summer story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops charles grodin who i normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original and his character never seems anything but forced kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night br br the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper thin may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to a christmas story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time 2 out of 10
<START> holes 2003 dir andrew davis br br when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing he is sent to 'camp green lake' at this camp the warden and her two henchman mr sir and dr pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole but for what reason stanley plans to find out br br i never really had any intention in watching 'holes' and i must admit i only really watched the film because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf but even if you are not a fan of him then it doesn't matter 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past these are not distracting and really gives a great back story all the cast are great the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy shia labeouf shows that even at 17 he can act without any flaws this is one disney film you definitely would enjoy as a family br br i learn from failure stanley yelnats iii henry winkler
<START> ok but does that make this a good movie well not really in my opinion there isn't a whole lot to recommend it i found it very slow tediously in fact it's also predictable pretty much through and through number one and two were somewhat predictable but not as much i also felt this movie was quite campy at times which i didn't really think fits this series and the character jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment he's a decent enough actor but i felt he played his character too over the top i guess that fit with the tone of the movie which would have been great if i had liked the movie plus there were some pretty bad one liners arnold vosloo returns in the title role but is given little to work with in this movie the character has not really evolved as i had hoped oh well this is just my opinion anyway for me while this movie is not abysmal it is pretty bad my vote for darkman iii 3 5 5
<START> i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrong br br this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie br br the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty bad br br when i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream 2 but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie br br warning major spoilers br br probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasn't even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie br br don't see this film you'll probably be disappointed
<START> people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i'm glad to say this movie isn't one of them over nine million dollars which i don't think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn't think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years
<START> dude really where have you guys been the past 20 years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of tod browning the victims of dracula and frankenstein the undying monster ernest thesiger paul wegener's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train you can't compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft please understand
<START> this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
<START> saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once beirut what do you know about beirut beirut he's the best damn baseball that ever lived br br you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v vikings monday night football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy
<START> i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you can't believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvd br br so if want to see a horror movie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
<START> a horribly pointless and worse boring film stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way br br will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey's truman show and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights for well pretty much nothing br br emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews i've read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy please that she ended up falling for ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous br br marc forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with br br i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this i wish i'd opted for the prestige
<START> eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version my vote is eight br br title brazil Ãxtase ecstasy
<START> i made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome on paper the script seems hopeful and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes i liked pacino in scent of a woman and have seen anny duperrey and marthe keller in several french and other films of the 70s 80s but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film and in this film they are absolute trash the filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level in addition to that i am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport even the inelegant dialogues in love story were better than the ones in this film and that's saying something i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much
<START> a bunch of women who can't act sit around talk smoke pot they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers we don't see them killing anyone suddenly there is a body on the floor covered by a bloodied sheet i can't eat spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is hunting them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sit on the couch sisters is never explained there are also scenes of some superhuman guy freaking out he p es blood and punches through a wall but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story br br there is no action no special effects no story if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking then here's 90 minutes of that because except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes absolutely nothing happens yawn oh i almost forgot you get to see them move some stuff including the deformed sister when they move to their new apartment its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed
<START> ok where do i begin this movie changed my life the plot was seamless james cahill has out done himself initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen however this was before exploring the dvd's many features oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience br br i was so impressed by the other actors the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue pornographic movies i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel br br i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school and possibly the guy playing a retard all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years where my oscars at dawn
<START> i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an anglophile who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800's i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production
