<START> leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if he'd direct a pokemon film i'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i don't mind sex or even sleaze check my other reviews on film but frankly it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it it's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women br br the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william devane who is totally wasted here br br but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film
<START> the film had some likable aspects perhaps too many for my taste it felt as though the writer director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters not once a few times but all of the time br br this is the job of television not cinema br br the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend br br i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence br br i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences this is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest br br that said there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity infusing it with passion and hand crafted charm br br i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked who knows if there's a god like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was br br perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife i'm giving up smoking br br an anti smoking commercial a tac ad with some tasteful animation i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark it was all too much
<START> warning mild spoilers br br the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing even moving episode in american history and world religious history this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing br br joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers alvin hyrum joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents br br joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph's marriage to emma br br this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a critique simply a note about the style br br the practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked br br the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments br br the film shows many scenes from joseph's life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph's life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion br br as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful br br at the end the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed br br when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an insider i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an american religious man or something else br br the film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we moderns take for granted
<START> viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence now that is funny would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle but trust me folks this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in i'd say you've lost your sense of humor br br david niven plays a doomed and bravado besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable female air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death isn't it romantic of course he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance and washes up on the beach just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle they immediately clinch br br looking past the bizarre homo erotic subtexts so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts from a naked boy sitting bare butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight zone esquire theme on his little flute to a celestial courier so campy queen y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies' the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love we get it fly boys like girls in skirts and heels and girls like 'em back and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb br br as for the quality of the production the continuity editing is poor enough to induce cringing and the lighting is perhaps even worse than that but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad there are games played with technicolor whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that and foreshadowing so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck and freeze motion which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera br br the best shots are the early ones on the beach but after that it's all downhill the moving like an escalator is moving staircase is hardly the odessa steps to say the least and i'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie making on their account the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and that's about the best thing i can say for it
<START> the wicker man has done the impossible it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind yes it's really that bad so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes i might actually go for the red hot needles br br neil labute created a rare movie where joel schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind yeah that's some bad direction right there br br i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line some sacrifices must be made sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment seriously the movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and i would still rather with be stuck on gilligans island with only pictures of condoleezza rice then find myself stranded there br br the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart i've ever heard in a movie theater that's not a joke nor is it fictional i've never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film i can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly i honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since deez powder and i pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all nic cage films write to your congressman today don't delay at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna ferris is going to show upÂoh how i wish br br nic cage throws out so much ham per frame i'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today to think that i ever thought sean penn was a d ck for slamming nic's acting oh he's still a d ck just lesser of oneÂyes sean penn's d ck was lessened because of this film do us all a favor nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit like the fart not a joke or a functional moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like conan o'brian's masturbating bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and lilith fair yes i just spoiled the ending for youÂand if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend i sat through this crap fest so you don't have to br br about half way through this little misadventure i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time ok 35 minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first even steve martin as inspector clouseau could have figured this out in under an hourÂand you sir are no inspector clouseau br br if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bullet br br somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all
<START> this one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era of course that doesn't mean coach the movie is a wonderful experience to behold it runs into the same vein as fastbreak which was better but still tame and is basically standard fare fluff what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste it's the same feeling you may get after watching this a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty but i expected better things
<START> the zenith of two brilliant careers david lynch better known for less accessible material crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise a man travels to see his estranged brother having no other means of transportation his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower richard farnsworth in his last film delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things straight story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed sissy spacek is notable as farnsworth's daughter an impaired middle aged woman living with the loss of her children
<START> this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the prospective of 1925 america he was fantastic likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed race love affair american manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman's agreement its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget br br however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack brando's accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and umeki who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film br br taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film's end is equally good of course it doesn't have the mouth sucking spit swapping and worse that exemplifies love in today's movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesn't touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead
<START> this is one of the most brilliant movies that i have seen in recent times goes way above even any international movie of any repute i am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved sonali kulkarni winning the national award is perhaps the only consoling fact renuka daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes there are a few scenes that stand out when gauri comes back from the city on krishna's wedding she and krishna meet for the first time in many years krishna notices a change in gauri but not a single line of dialogue is said the entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes there's another towards the end when krishna pleads to abhay kulkarni to marry gauri instead if you are not moved by that scene you don't have a heart br br watch this movie for sheer movie making brilliance and acting capabilities
<START> i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw it was a cool fun movie dolph looked superbly cool on the bike he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies he is now in a pretty good shape the story was ok and the other actors were also passable i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie br br but it also had its share of problems the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers there should've been more bad guys last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy but that was due to the small budget overall the movie was a good movie i enjoyed it i would recommend others to watch it p s now u r a dead beat cop some one liners were also cool br br
<START> i wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original but it is very good in it's own right the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them br br the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original but that's what makes it so great peter hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles i don't care what anyone says i think keanu reeves is a great actor i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex winter's bill i was very happy to see george carlin returning to the role of rufus very cool hal london jr who plays the part of ted logan's father does a really good job the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene and he pulls it off impressively well i can't forget to mention william sadler as death he completely made the movie for me the rest of the cast is quite good as well br br if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series then i would hope you would like this film as well but don't expect it to be as good as the original i really hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> the plot of 'edison' was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire f r a t squad br br whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it br br do not waste your time watching this film don't even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choice br br and justin if you're reading this stick to music even though you're no good at that you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing
<START> let me start out by saying i'm a big carrey fan although i'll admit i haven't seen all of his movies cough the magestic cough bruce almighty was enjoyable none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end i dont know what the writers were thinking somehow i couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re creating liar liar br br on a positive note the daily show's steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast see bruce almighty if you're a big jim carrey fan or if you just want to see a light hearted que soft piano music somewhat funny comedy
<START> director edward montagne does in a little more than one hour what other more expensive and hyped films fail to do mr montagne shows us a police story written by phillip h reisman jr that while is not one of the best of the genre it keeps the viewer involved in all that's going on br br this is clearly a b type movie in fact the best thing going for the tattooed stranger is the opportunity to take a peek at the way new york looked in those years the crystal clear cinematography by william o steiner either has been kept that way through the years or has been lovingly restored br br there are great views of new york in the opening sequence later we are taken to brooklyn to the dumbo section and later on the film travels to the bronx and the gun hill road area with its many monument stores in the area br br john miles and walter kinsella made a great detective team patricia barry is perfect as the plant expert from the museum of natural history jack lord who went to bigger things in his career is seen in a non speaking role br br it was great fun to watch a city as it was because it doesn't exist any more
<START> this movie was bad beyond belief i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point we all understood by the end br br its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least a scene would start going then someone would say wow you're so great bettie why don't we make another movie this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up it was that ludicrous i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory br br i know movies are expensive i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen the movie looks like it was made for 12 the cuts the graininess and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience this movie makes dude where's my car look like citizen kane br br my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie bettie paige's movies were destroyed they should destroy this movie too
<START> an album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new this film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments and why not towering talent from dame judith dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right to olympia dukakis as the merry widow living in a scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages to ian holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a world war ii all girl more or less swing band but wait there's more add in leslie caron on bass and the incomparable clio laine on lead vocal at last and the blonde bombshells are the hottest band in england since the beatles well ok not really but this movie is a winner br br elizabeth dench spends the whole film trying to reunite the blonde bombshells to play at her granddaughter's school dance and before you roll your eyes imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenarian women to step onstage in front of the britney spears generation following an act called open wound br br in an age when actresses careers are over by the time they're 30 most bands' second album is a greatest hits compilation and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay it's great to see real talent real music and a really good movie come from where else the bbc br br i love this movie and i know i'll watch it many more times and enjoy it more each time
<START> and i actually gave it a zero on my personal 1 10 scale i have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater i don't rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated zero br br my wife and i took our four children then aged 15 11 8 and 6 and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter now 26 who alerted me to this site amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4 br br the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time and is even worse in retrospect the acting particularly by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply silly br br
<START> this wretched movie shows that not even some of gollywood's best can salvage a true landfill deposit br br i could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort but that would require more time and i've already wasted 91 minutes watching it br br looking at it now after brando's death shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become br br donald sutherland why br br i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted br br don't waste your time with this movie i'm overdue to do something interesting bye
<START> you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still sub par dont get me wrong b5 the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series i dont like o'hare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of babylon squared and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a b5 fan and havent seen this movie see it if you arent a b5 fan dont you wont want to watch the series
<START> most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this level br br cheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandler br br i see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that you're not alone br br jerry
