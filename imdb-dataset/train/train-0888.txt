<START> sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original creepshow br br by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down br br watch the original creepshow instead or if you already have done then be happy with that
<START> a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well acted with wonderful characterizations br br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed hassie and michael winkelman little luke weren't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra br br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii get it broadside no not funny br br unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family we never missed it
<START> the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story i think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked we all have a mountain of swords within us we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives we all have to face our own insomnia someday granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it i'd watch it again br br i don't know if there's a difference between the legend of zu which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles and zu warriors the dubbed usa version it might have been dumbed down for american audiences which really would have detracted from this film
<START> with films like wallace gromit and chicken run under their belt the good people from the other side of the pond aardman animation are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of creature comforts br br derived from a short done early in their careers creature comforts is a slice of life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort br br aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as are you a liar and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives br br the answers while seeming to be boring and mundane are actually quite funny when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later br br how many of these animals look like the person making the statements one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman i like them kind of thin is an insect the walking stick br br there are two dogs discussing odors and smells while sniffing the behind of a poodle as they talk about the different smells of a woman br br there are two birds in a cage as the wife tells the litany that is her health her long suffering husband stands by her saying nothing br br while it might take some time for creature comforts to find it's legs it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills creature comforts is one of a kind and definitely worth watching br br some of the humor might seem a little racy it's the claymation that catches the attention of the children like the old batman series of the 60's the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them and it's the jokes that are there for the adults
<START> for every series that makes it to television a 100 ideas are formed 50 scripts are written 15 pilots are made and one just one actually makes it to production from such a selection process we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series br br and so it goes with true blood all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea a screen play a pilot and finally a series unfortunately it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings oh how wrong they so often are br br true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines worst acting and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents alan ball's not so secret desires for ryan jason stackhouse gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline tara's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning noon and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship br br as for bill the vampire his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her although she remains somewhat unharmed we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs br br despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show its still bad somethings die for a reason even vampires maybe this show should to
<START> a very ordinary made for tv product tyson attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans
<START> this scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager now i find it more amusing than scary but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that i like and come to think of it the plot is rather disgusting actually but handled with some kind of taste if there is a problem with this movie it is that there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens also the ending goes on forever making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with barbara bach screaming and screaming the monster after it is exposed isn't very scary either unfortunately the somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it making it appear as a tv movie more than something made for theaters but it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so i urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic
<START> since september of last year i have been borrowing four to six films each week from the harold washington library which boasts an impressive dvd collection the hwl truly is a circulating library three quarters of its films are out at any given time recently i was thrilled to find the short films of david lynch yesterday knowing little about the animated series i picked up dumbland i'm here to report that for david lynch fans watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent br br the most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks each episode has its own rhythm respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion outrageous voices accent pauses' ends physical violence supplies the beats chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges many other elements fill out the orchestra the pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound but the soundtrack itself struck me as lynch's primary interest in creating and disseminating this work in a way these eight shorts are unique lynchian rhythms br br that said the situations are odd ugly profound dumb and funny as hell and there's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be i can't say that i'll watch the collection again but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite inland empire dumbland is worth half an hour of your time
<START> or type on a computer keyboard they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today
<START> it was almost worth sitting through this entire god awful film just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again acting 0 script 0 fight scenes 0 male lead 0 cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl nadia bjorlin 10 she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress this is the criteria i used to average it out to a two i lost count but i believe ever movie clichÃ© ever is in this movie when the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement plus he just shows up for no reason he was never even mentioned before i don't know what else to say here just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years at least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials
<START> i've read reviews of kerching on imdb and frankly i've not seen one positive review until now i actually like kerching kerching is about a teenage boy named taj lewis in order to make Â£1 000 000 for his mother he sets up a website called rudeboy the website offers a lot of interesting things if only taj and his 2 friends danny and seymour can stop taj from getting exposed i find this show quite funny and i enjoy watching it the acting is o k but it can definitely be better the characters are funny especially danny spooner taj's friend his stupidity is what makes him funny and taj's other friend seymour also carlton the owner of the cafÃ©'e called the chill we never see him we only hear him taj's younger brother omar and his older sister missy is funny too and missy's best friend kareesha so many times taj's has almost got exposed almost as well as the comedy the drama in kerching such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great
<START> carly pope plays jj a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her jj aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally 2 dimensional jj is a self serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow jj's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic the underlying message of an over 50 woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film
<START> takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark even as a kid i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most children's books miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never ending hazardous missions westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain but a self possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers i thought it was a great film highly recommended
<START> i picked this up in the 'danger after dark' box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore fest and with very bad dialogue which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way that sho gackt develops through the movie as a person the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good considering they aren't professional actors and the director did a marvelous job with it all setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards br br on a side note taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising the only other film i've seen him in is battle royale where he plays shogo kawada and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo toshi is bright exuberant and hyper serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it so watch out for his performance if you're familiar with battle royale you'll be very surprised by him br br but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box because this isn't really a vampire movie it's just a movie with a vampire in it that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground and you guys will love the last scene it's a really moving picture at some points the photography is really well done it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster
<START> i had high hopes for this film since it has charlton heston and jack palance but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so palance was ridiculous not even heston's acting or annabel schofield's beauty or brief nude scenes could save this film some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy the plot was ludicrous even sci fi fans should skip this one grade f
<START> i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the 70's it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my christmases were with my family magical santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year br br if you have a child children and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus it's a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one way br br it's a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays feliz navidad
<START> the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart the shortcomings of the film's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages historically this was in the late 8th century when the centers of irish learning were over run by the vikings the vikings appear here as brute antagonists the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east the film's narrative which functions more as a parable centers around the conflict between brendan who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness and his stern uncle the abbot who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen the abbot disregards the value of brendan's art in his quest for security this is the movie's outer conflict brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without that's as much of the story as i'll divulge br br what i really like about this film is its creators' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from 1200 years ago the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells particularly noteworthy is monk aidan's pet cat defined in few lines yet purely and even magically metamorphically feline the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells of course historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict however by introducing archetypal elements into this story the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived life from that far off time in ireland which feels psychologically true however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact the united nations' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues' club of artists in the secret of kells aren't historically probable but they're all well designed individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the dark ages the secret of kells is what it would look like finally brendan's hero's quest in this film is the artist's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty life and inspiration without being preachy or even particularly christian this movie affirms jesus' dictum that man does not live by bread alone in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky's andrei rublev a film about the great russian icon painter of the 15th century the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist's visual quest and creative process it's certainly not as profound as andrei rublev but heck its a cartoon and one which will appeal to young and old alike i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life affirming way this stylized secret of kells is a classic
<START> very bad acting and a very shallow story not even a decent b movie br br events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame br br this is one of the worst sci fi i've ever seen i saw the 5 0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre but it sucked so bad br br now there's really very few good movies on alien subject i think because most of them are low budget br br i give it 3 10
<START> vodka lemon is a charming yet extremely uneven arminian film that will delight some and bore others though reasonably well crafted the film lacks any real zing relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art house viewer the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance unfortunately they deserve a film worthy of their genius too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled you may laugh but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides a noble effort ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion
<START> i respect the fact that this is a very popular show however in comparison with robert altman's ingenious hilarious zany and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic this show was probably destined to be less than mediocre even if it did run for 11 years that doesn't necessarily make it any good this show formed an all too integral part of my early childhood it was on re runs every night and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up but it's one of the memories i don't miss and now that i actually have seen the movie i can give this series an accurate critique on its own it's not nearly 2 out of 10 bad however the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie some of them technically are the same but they're only similar in name for instance since when is alan alda anything like donald sutherland his style of humor is totally different as are his characterization and outlook the new characters are not that great they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing it's the same with the new actors including jamie farr the only thing that actually transfers to the series is radar who's still even though played by the same actor merely a pale imitation of the original what else oh yeah with a laugh track it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not it comes across as creepy due to what's going on in the other settings and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons i've never liked this show and i never will
