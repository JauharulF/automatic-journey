<START> outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series as much as raiders of the lost ark only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau predating batman by two decades starring ron ely tarzan as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non existent latin american country of hidalgo best line our hero to mona holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug mona you're a brick br br paul wexler's ham and cheese blackhat captain seas is a an absolute delight expect a little raiders a dash of batman a little the lost world a little lost horizons and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music a prime candidate for dvd release it is certainly overdue an unmissable treat for the whole family 9 10
<START> i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every viewing i agree with all of the positive reviews here yes it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days i found myself doing commentary as i watched it someone on here said rip torn was miscast i couldn't disagree more he is brilliant as the dour miserly clyde stewart who says little and works like a slave workhorse conchatta farrell is fantastic as the widowed elinor whom clyde hires as a housekeeper cook along with her 7 old daughter lilia skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma also a star is the stark montana prairie it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary no special effects here what you see is real it even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script once you see heartland you'll never forget it it deserves all the 10s it gets here
<START> oh brother after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song br br is that all there is i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the u s i was too young to get in the theater although i did manage to sneak into goodbye columbus then a screening at a local film museum beckoned finally i could see this film except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it br br the only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its u s release millions of people flocked to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex film instead they got lots of closeups of gnarly repulsive swedes on street interviews in bland shopping malls asinie political pretension and feeble who cares simulated sex scenes with saggy pale actors br br cultural icon holy grail historic artifact whatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the ashes in a lead box br br elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings but if it weren't for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgotten br br instead the i am blank blank rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films i am curious lavender for gay films i am curious black for blaxploitation films etc and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that naughty sex film that revolutionized the film industry br br yeesh avoid like the plague or if you must see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with br br
<START> trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi devout mormons and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt hale's fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters br br the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didn't understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a 300 pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painful br br the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me
<START> i just don't get some of the big premises of this episode that miranda is so remarkable and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness miranda is just a jerk the episode is slow inconsistent and way too talky i also don't quite understand why kolos is an ambassador why doesn't the federation just leave the damn medusans be there's one part i do like when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience overall i love tos and even at its lamest i'll always tune in this episode though mmm i wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under 3
<START> now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title if you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review anyhow i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately this movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience if you're a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
<START> the original lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre it's pure adventure sf with some substance here and there and i've always wondered why hollywood hasn't filmed it verbatim because it's just the kind of thing they love massive explosions super weapons uber heroics hero gets the girl aliens great cgi potential good versus evil in the purest form etc etc instead and bear in mind i'm a japan o phile and anime lover we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story mixes in star wars ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to 'thundercats' level to see kimball kinnison the epitome of the galactic patrol officer and second stage lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful etc i just can't understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money far by telling straight it makes no sense
<START> there really wasn't much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness but there isn't much more than that br br it mixes some scenes from the original then it ab libs about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation br br i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these direct to video productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham d
<START> in nyc seaman michael o'hara orson welles rescues elsa bannister rita hayworth from a mugging rape as she takes a horse carriage through central park and lives to regret it titian haired hayworth's a platinum blonde in this one as dazzling as fresh fallen snow but nowhere near as pure br br to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal noir would be criminal it's as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes but the film holds far darker secrets from the ny times childhood shadows the hidden story of the black dahlia murder by mary pacios mary pacios who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old bette short retraces short's steps interviewing friends and associates she also offered a detailed if speculative analysis of orson welles particularly in regard to his movie the lady from shanghai according to ms pacios the movie along with related archival materials has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with short's murder she raises the question could welles have been the killer interesting theories and with the spate of books now out on the black dahlia much more may come to light fritz lang's brutal film noir the big heat 1953 was a roman a clef telling of the dahlia killing in the city of nets that was l a but it's the orson opus that the dahlia had a hands on connection to in reality it was bugsy siegel and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940's that did the dahlia in but that doesn't negate much of what pacios wrote almost all of hollywood intersected with elizabeth the black dahlia short and her tale aura legacy curse is encoded in a number of golden age films br br the black dahlia was always on the peripheral edges of shanghai even before it started filming barbara payton on franchot tone it was when he was thinking about making the lady from shanghai before he lost the option to orson welles franchot said he'd been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the dahlia in the formosa cafe across from the goldwyn studios the floor above the formosa cafe was bugsy siegel's office and the dahlia one of his on again off again working girls br br it gets deeper and darker after the 1951 brawl over barbara payton between tom neal and franchot tone that sent franchot to the hospital with a concussion and never talking the same way again barbara said she married tone just to spite neal tom detour neal also knew the dahlia who didn't and became obsessed from l a despair by john gilmore the january 1947 slaying of the young beautiful would be actress elizabeth short known as the black dahlia was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime a project called who killed the black dahlia was being kicked off by actor tom neal a hell raiser from ww ii movies potential producer gene harris someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by tom neal and his cohorts not long after it would be very clear one beautiful day to come when tom would sneak up on his pretty new palm springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a 45 bullet through her head barbara payton and norma jean dougherty later marilyn monroe knew the dahlia and their stories are well known it seems all who crossed the path of the dahlia like the proverbial black cat entered a twilight zone darkness and or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward tone neal welles are only a few and this includes a butchered film called the lady from shanghai br br lady from shanghai took two years to be released thanks to extensive re editing and all because columbia president harry cohn couldn't understand the story it's dark noir to be sure one of the darkest in fact it's also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic age br br nicolas christopher br br shanghai pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city the film's principal murder victim and there are many a psychotic and double dealing lawyer manically foresees armageddon at every turn claiming he can feel it he announces that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island a particularly acid joke on welles' part since this was the very year the u s began testing atomic bombs at just such a place the bikini atoll relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem by the time of bikini the erotic identification of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been institutionalized with the blessing of the military brass the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named gilda and has hayworth's image in provocative dress painted directly on its casing br br its ironic that orson welles' broad interpretation of an irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many welles is giving a clue to viewers that michael o'hara is only the storyteller not part of the story even though it revolves around him o'hara contradicts the shark motif throughout the film sharks on a feeding frenzy won't stop until there's nothing left michael o'hara lives to tell the tale elsa bannister causes a feeding frenzy during o'hara's trial and her netted chapeau suggests she's caged in so as not to devour the human spectators to a roman coleseum the spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own gossiping and carrying on about elsa a human aquarium correlating to the san francisco marine museum sequence that's the human condition except for michael o'hara and yet he'll be spending his life trying to forget his past elsa or die trying elsa is part of michael and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble
<START> this is the most messed up entry on imdb that i've yet to stumble across all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie this is not the movie rather it's merely a featurette that's an extra on the dvd of the movie the one it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it's listed here as in actuality it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts and his reflections on the movie so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit fubar don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong you can trust me because i never feed you dear reader bs br br and that's the truth i guess u can say that i'm the one reviewer that matters
<START> admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which i'd heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked ahead of its time intelligent and engaging city political thriller it's not br br city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power two faced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really doesn't br br unfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and we're left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider web of lies and cover ups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i don't think we're left with that in city hall and while it's a very full film i don't find it altogether rich
<START> the film as entertainment is very good and jimmy stewart is excellent as chip hardesty with well done co starring turns by vera miles and murray hamilton but the film directed by legendary director mervyn leroy was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film down to clothing was closely watched and controlled by j edgar hoover not that j edgar hoover didn't have something to be proud of his management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world but by 1959 hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom and he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau the films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's enjoy the story but with tongue firmly in cheek
<START> the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead michael gaffikin james warwick a former paratrooper in the british army is the local dentist he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson celia imrie is always being viewed with a little suspicion not maliciously but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip maurice roÃ«ves at the islands police station inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp dr goudry for closer inspection a quick search for the killer proves fruitless as does a search for a missing local woman over dinner that night with michael gaffikin fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson a woman from the mainland who lives on the island through the winter months a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island one colonel howard jonathan newth who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together br br goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain with a heavy fog rolling in the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help the radio also doesn't work seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut reports of ufo's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved but a rise in radioactive levels on the island has him doubting himself br br the nightmare man is based on the novel child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire it is here adapted by dr who and blake's 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board the nightmare man though is on the whole a succinctly better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background the island setting is perhaps a genre clichÃ© that has been used over and over but its one that i enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to camfield he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times there is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point if there is one negative about the killer its that we are given his her its pov for the killings an acceptable clichÃ© on its own but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but it's a fun and very well acted piece the local scottish cast are exceptional the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold imrie never one i've taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production the outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers it disappointed me in some ways but taking into account when it was made its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it is even more terrifying
<START> i watched entranced and mesmerized by the vocal and physical acting the roles each character played were done with excellence the lyrics the words every gesture the sunrise told it all the movie spoke to me it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind who believes in peace and gentle behavior i was also held in disbelieve by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed power without grace is demented and without feelings to want power at the cost of mankind is so unbelievable this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world and it is with sadness that i think of them i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all may this movie be blessed
<START> i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
<START> i'm not alone in admiring the first superman movie a film that richard donner executed masterfully i am also not alone in scorning richard lester's superman 2 which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie sadly it is still an absolute abomination br br superman's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses but superman 2 stretches things too far it doesn't matter who directed superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman with or without his powers superman's strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner there is too much to criticize so i will not bother i condemn this movie perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on super duper bad
<START> i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor like many others on here i don't know how to categorize this film it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didn't
<START> this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with batman that was done with gilligan's island in surviving gilligan's island for those of you who missed it and shame surviving gilligan's island full title surviving gilligan's island the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history was a special from a few years back where bob denver gilligan dawn wells mary ann and russell johnson the professor related the story of the show's creation cancellation rediscovery rebirth along the way stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew it was very well done it was funny well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show br br return to the batcave the misadventures of adam and burt is in a similar style the re telling of the history of the show the re enactments the general feel are all the same what's missing is the straightforward approach that surviving took br br in return adam west and burt ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited after being allowed to stay adam and burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show the legendary batmobile adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the batmobile and why br br choosing to use this conceit actually having a plot is the biggest letdown of this show unlike surviving return forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline the theft of the batmobile instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in the history of the show it is the historical sections that work the best the casting as in surviving is excellent jack brewer adam west and jason marsden burt ward capture the feel of the actors without looking too much like them brett rickaby frank gorshin bears a stronger resemblance to his subject but captures none of the late gorshin's charm only his characterizations other actors' portrayals are short and functional with none standing out as especially good or bad many of the stories have been told before but they mostly play out amusingly with only the occasional clunky presentation another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of lyle waggoner's tryout for the part of batman the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story this downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly br br the main plot if that is what we must call it is of course ludicrous this is not really a fault in and of itself but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot especially in these kinds of things but we really get neither here the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat even for them the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural again i think the comparison to surviving gilligan's island can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback in surviving that's all it intends to be in return it tries to do double duty and unfortunately often fails gorshin and newmar do well although i agree with others that gorshin had not aged well and that newmar had and what's waggoner taking to look that good but aren't given enough to do again i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here br br another odd point about return this special is about the batman tv series and its history yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie even the waggoner footage is technically movie footage if you know you're bat history then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first only to be delayed in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast so when waggoner and west were testing for the role it was for the movie not the tv show why return only uses movie footage is unclear it most probably has to do with rights issues but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know seeing julie newmar in the present but only footage of lee meriwether as catwoman in the past br br overall i liked the show mainly for the flashbacks i would have preferred the style used in surviving gilligan's island but i can understand why they'd want a more story oriented piece given the subject matter besides i like these people it's nice to see them out and about still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there
<START> i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as i'm concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of landon's puss than should be allowed br br this movie reflects everingham's story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair
<START> i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production while a comedy oldies radio dj in 1988 i got a call from the production company they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv the television screen itself would never be shown i said sure wrote a parody of '50s sci fi monster clichÃ©s rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj pam landry to play the female part as she happened to be on the air at the time she put on a long song joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take giggling she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects we'd have never done it if we'd known that woodchipper massacre was going to be such a turkey but then again we never got paid for our efforts either gary theroux
