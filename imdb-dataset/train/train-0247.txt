<START> does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top 10 films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson michelle johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying that's all you need to know
<START> although the story is fictional it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world this is the true pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel film the offbeat supranatural stuff lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie after all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world although is not critically acclaimed probably because of the supranatural stuff this is an excellent movie with a great story and great acting
<START> in bridgeport the deranged high school teacher richard fenton johnathon schaech is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel brittany snow she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life three years later the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills on her prom night she goes with her boyfriend bobby scott porter and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path br br the forgettable slash prom night is a collection of clichÃ©s with a total lack of originality the stupid story is shallow and silly with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes my vote is three br br title brazil a morte convida para danÃ§ar the death invites to dance
<START> i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana lucia and libby's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode gah i can't handle it br br i liked this show for the first season but it definitely declined in the second season i found jack and locke's little religious feud to be annoying the deaths of rodriguez watros' characters was the final straw br br i give this episode a 4 10 for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j j abrams i hope his series in the future will improve on this one
<START> an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised there's a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had br br first of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others br br secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition i'm not talking about happy endings here or even an ending period but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in br br last but not least i did not feel new york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed br br what you're left with is high brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied
<START> seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible downright terrible and not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review i thought i might agree with him seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie definitely lacks good looking females let me be the first to say wow that was definitely some serious in depth reviewing there my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie seriously though a lack of good looking females shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie if you're desperate enough for good looking females you should really watch other types of movies not necessarily falling into the sci fi category
<START> i saw this movie back in 1984 we first started watching this is spinal tap and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head you will want to watch this one br br the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this in my opinion there is no doubt that they could br br but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself br br but just to let you know we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do
<START> when i was younger i thought the first film was really good in childhood so i decided to see the sequel this is an example of why some films shouldn't have sequels because the first film is usually best and it is basically now that ariel and eric are married they have a daughter who isn't allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of ursula the octopus legged villain from film one morgana getting to her when the kid gets out she asks ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid like her mum was this makes ariel go back to the sea to find her the same good voice artists it's just the story that could have had a bit more thought adequate
<START> if you weren't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism let's face it in real life we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to in this sense it works this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster born a natural the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story jodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you try br br and therein is the core of the movie it's not about partying it's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone br br if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movie it will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them we all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her we all knew the boy crazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance we all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits and we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen maybe you were one of those girls maybe like me you had been each one at one time or another br br this film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs pressures womanhood childhood the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head each factor on the precipice which aspect do you hang on to what do you toss over the edge no matter how you may want to hold on and how painful is goodbye to everything you've known that's what this movie is steps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking if you were there you know and love this film as i do aching and tenderly done a fine piece of captured femininity
<START> i went to see vanilla sky with a huge huge huge tom cruise fan my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend what can i say i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tc's performance i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting br br i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it i am so pleased that i was 'coerced 'into seeing it the strange thing is i cannot say why all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day as to what i felt about the film all i can say about is its not the storyline fantasy psychodrama whatever its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events like getting into a car can change everything br br as to what the critics wrote yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for alejandro amenÃ¡bar but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruz br br i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it br br yes i know this isn't a balanced thoughtful review but so what it's not that kind of film
<START> i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing
<START> well i hated knocked up i despised 40 year old virgin and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie do yourself a favor and skip it i admit i don't like the actors in this movie and after my 18 year old son showed me the cover of the dvd i was like i wouldn't like that movie but at his insistence i decided to give it a try unfortunately br br about two minutes into the movie i turned it off i was so offended it's just disgusting any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie call me old fashioned but shoving your pussy juice covered hand into your friend's face so he will know you got some is over the line of decency in my opinion yeah that's how this putrid little film starts and i can only imagine it gets much worse from there another real winner for mr rudd i bet he's proud as punch imagine if you could only get worthless roles like he gets would you stay in movies despite the pay i wouldn't br br i should have known better next time i will
<START> actually i liked this movie very very much not because of it s plot acting jokes no i liked it because it s one of the worse movies ever created it s so lame so bad that it becomes terribly funny some jokes are actually cool but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter men in white are so dumb and stupid that you can do only two things turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing beer helps a lot i chose the second option
<START> this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bc br br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
<START> in war inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton kellogg brown root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusack's latest piece cusack plays a corporate hit man named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over sexualized pop star played by hilary duff we are introduced to hauser's past which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him and played hilariously by joan cusack while some moments are played suitably over the top they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise all the principals turn in solid performances duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image tomei is funny but understated while the cusack's own nearly every scene they are in to be fair they are given good material the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion in fact the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it's way to the expected conclusion br br if you like your comedy broad and physical there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie on the other hand if you like sly comedy and broad satire this is for you
<START> james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author when one reads deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south when one watches john boorman's film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book the camera is as descriptive as the narration the characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic i first saw this movie in 1992 after my freshman year of college i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973 among them were patton papillon and all the president's men fine films all of them this one was easily the class of the group that says a lot
<START> a one is the highest rating i could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed pee yew pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns and poop and fart jokes for example gene stapelton's ding bat from all in the family character telling marilu henner's character that she swings both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie you want good cheeky humor rent animal house american pie part one only old school or office space
<START> check out the film's website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it couldn't be more off in it's boasting original story original they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn tooting high end special effects come on i could do better with an atari 7600 and a jug of earwax stylish cinematography oh yes the america's funniest home video look is still a classic i'm sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren't really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen befores and done already's
