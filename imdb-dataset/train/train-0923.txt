<START> i watched this film last night with anticipation but really wasn't very impressed br br with the exception of 'combo' i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited it came across like a 'made for tv' drama br br i felt that the film was very contrived the whole set up of hammering in the context at the start yes we get that this is 80s britain you can stop now was tiresome and gave a very one sided view of what life was like in 80s britain poverty war juxtaposed with royalty margaret thatcher yet nothing in between there were actually middle classes who existed back then just ordinary working people with a decent wage and a mortgage the falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end for 'dramatic effect' i presume br br the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly br br the relationship between 'shaun' and 'smell' was toe curling i couldn't even look during the snogging scene i find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger but also looked so much younger i know there were only four years between them but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties yet it's a huge difference in your teens in my experience that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one since girls mature so much quicker and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older sorry but i didn't buy it an unnecessary plot point created for shock value br br the ending was somewhat abrupt and again contrived if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic then it fell somewhat short in my eyes br br it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty stricken don't get me wrong i love trainspotting and four weddings has its charms but can't we brits come up with anything different why are our films always so hung up on the class system i was born in 1973 so wasn't much different in age to 'shaun' would've been in 1983 i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down trodden council estate in a city in england however my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film i don't even remember racism being an issue although i'm not saying it didn't exist 'this is england' not in my experience br br the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance and i was completely bored and unimpressed throughout
<START> rachel jo hannah tina bradley and john are all on top form here they deserve oscar nominations for their performances i am a great fan of the tv show aswell their music rocks and they're all so talented i am also a great exponent of sarcasm br br if you're an s club fan do not read this br br the performances are terribly weak the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly i feel sorry for the director the jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little passionate s club fans weren't laughing they thought they could do it better and they did they conquered the world they became s club juniors paul the fat ugly one who started a mosh band must be thanking his lucky stars that he left when he did one of the worst movies ever made beware of this movie do not go and see it you won't laugh you will cry 0 10 rjt
<START> what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night jeopardy was fantastic it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat br br barbara stanwyck plays helen who with husband doug barry sullivan and son lee aaker drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope br br while there she runs into a psychotic killer ralph meeker one of my favourites and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband br br the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise i was not expecting such a great film but i suppose i should have realized is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful
<START> don't listen to the misleading title werewolf woman the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films but this one here is just a bit too much werewolf woman seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner fun the first few times but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly shes not even a werewolf but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy the film can't even decide its tone with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror i thought i was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller at the end the director insists this is based on a true story yeah all right br br to be fair there are a few entertaining aspects of the production the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes however these become rather monotonous quickly also the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion especially the worlds most swinging doctor he drinks on the job unfortunately the film becomes pretty irritating fast there's no actual plot or anything else really its a shame because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential werewolf woman is far overlong slow moving and a bit too pointless even by the standards of the exploitation genre 4 10
<START> if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do you'll love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick side br br amazing film dark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse you'll get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tight every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work
<START> wow i read about this movie and it sounded so awful that i had to see it and my gosh i can smell it in st louis where do i start national lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of animal house but they completely missed the mark i'll go chronologically with these short flicks br br short film 1 br br poor peter riegert boon from animal house apparently he wasn't working back then so the boys at national lampoons probably called and said hey we're making a c ppy movie wanna be in it peter was like well i'm not doing much these days why not he was a great side character in animal house but he couldn't carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes br br possible spoiler the premise is funny enough with jason cooper riegert telling his wife to leave him she needs to find herself it's too weird that they're actually in a happy marriage so he chases her off there she goes and cooper is in charge of the kids this off course leads to him burning the house down losing several of the kids and sleeping with an assortment of new york bimbos including an ever so young diane lane then the wife comes back wants the kids and the film ends with a coin flip that'll decide the fate of the children the idea was actually somewhat clever but the director stunk the characters all seem like they're falling asleep they had to be doped up sorry boon your legacy was tarnished with this flop br br short film 2 br br more spoilers br br enter dominique corsaire pretty girl recently finished college not sure what to do with her life so she becomes a slut starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys takes their money when they die and she doesn't stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world fred willard ooops i mean the president of the united states once again it could have been funny and though i was happy that corsaire ann dusenberry in real life wasn't afraid to bare all her acting was horrible what a waste of time br br short film 3 br br i can't believe i made it this far here's the rookie cop brent falcone robby benson with veteran stan nagurski richard widmark falcone is young naive thinks he can really help people though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times nagurski really has just given up caring he watches muggings assaults you name it and never intervenes he figures the world is lawless and he'll probably get sued if he does anything even christopher lloyd at the end of taxi's run gets in on the action getting the police called on him committing a crime but having his lawyer there to protect him god bless america br br once again could have been funny the performances were intentionally campy but goodness no energy whatsoever henry jaglom and bob giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock i think the writing wasn't bad the ideas were there but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the iranian hostage crisis if i had been a part of this film i would want my name removed it's horrible then again that's why i watched it br br the only good thing about this garbage is that dr john did the film score repeating going to the movies over and over again and the film isn't much longer than an hour and a half show this one in film classes with the heading what you should never do in film making this script should have been left on the shelf because yep it's that bad
<START> bottom of the freddy barrel this is the worst film in the series beating freddy's revenge for that title a cheap looking with mediocre special effects incoherent mess with freddy turned into a punster he has one or two cool lines but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel
<START> those who know who know the kelly legend are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film eg naomi watt's character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinema's best ned not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious mick jagger former carlton champion australian rules football bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes ballarat
<START> spoilers br br i watched half of this movie and i didn't like it br br first reason boring barely anything happens the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope they smoke weed read magazines care for their sick friend and cut up the occasional dead body boring br br second reason there are too many things left unexplained many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men restrains them in a chair and interrogates them who are these men how do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters why does he kill one and let another one go br br also there is this dude who at first i thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought never explained how frustrating is that br br conclusion i found the women annoying the story uninteresting the duologue tedious and the action non existent also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't i rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website and although i respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick i will from now on make sure i read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie i regret seeing
<START> the movie took a new angle to gandhi's life which is nice to see and it shows how human he was his relationship with harilal is something that gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography br br my big gripe is that i thought gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie it could have been better acted by the person who played gandhi some of gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie br br the movie is not really all rounded but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie br br overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture
<START> this is one of the more adorable episodes of the twilight zone with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments there's the usual blond vamp dancer what is up with serling's fondness for that kind of character such that she keeps showing up in various episodes and other assorted characters but it's jack elam's old man who totally steals the show i consider this the funny light hearted version of the monsters are due on maple street or perhaps a 20 minute twilight zone parody of the thing on another note i thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things he looked familiar but it seems that ron kipling disappeared after just two tv credits to his name
<START> time and time again it seems that the comedic actors of hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers first it was robin williams 'one hour photo 2002 ' then it was jim carrey 'eternal sunshineÂ 2004 ' being one example then will ferrell 'stranger than fiction 2006 ' and now adam sandler yes that's absolutely right the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless goofball comedies i'm not complaining i've always been a fan has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud of course some readers may be wondering whatever happened to 'punch drunk love 2002 ' but i can only assure you that it's a film i'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible since i've heard it's terrific my first film from director mike binder 'reign over me ' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship though it does occasionally stray into all too familiar territory the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving with both sandler and don cheadle giving memorable performances br br alan johnson cheadle is a successful dentist with a good family though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife jada pinkett smith and so his marriage is a little shaky charlie fineman adam sandler is alan's ex college roommate a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief a disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes often likened in appearance to bob dylan charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry and spends his time in solitude listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world driving around manhattan in his motorised scooter immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife's final wishes when alan and charlie meet for the first time in years the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life crippling experience indeed at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling br br initially it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the september 11 attacks as a storytelling device afterall wouldn't it be just as devastating if charlie's family had died in an ordinary everyday car accident however if you consider that the director's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy then 'reign over me' does a very good job it's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks this is the first 9 11 orientated film i've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren't even involved whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved adam sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task snapping instantly between cheerfulness anger and depression charlie fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise a hollow soul who thanks to the companionship of an old friend can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark bleak tunnel
<START> i thought this was a quiet good movie it was fun to watch it what i liked best where the 'outtakes' at the end of the movie they were great
<START> i was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the problems antwone fisher had in the movie but i still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them it even caused me to realize that i do have a missing piece and i am going to seek out my birthparents now br br i cried for almost a day after i saw this the first time antwone's confrontation with his birthmother juxtaposed with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our birth parents and his self confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful i could really identify with this and my need to tell people yeah i was put aside by my parents when i was born but another set of parents picked me up and loved me and now i am a success br br it also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home and it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is if you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in florida who was lost and then the miranda ashley story in oregon city where scf ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them and the week this movie was released yet another story in new jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system one died the state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed as a stripper and only occasionally used heroin br br there are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that antwone fisher should be a best picture nominee for sure no matter if you are adopted or not it is a heart tugger that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society
<START> how sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1 i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching every single part of the film was awful music acting direction story everything simply everything i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand because well just because product placement crucifix's crucifi everywhere if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied you may like this movie if you do like this movie you really need to get out more
<START> lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl azaria as seventh day adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer's rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents suddenly she hears azaria crying as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the dingo although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the chamberlains struggle to accept god's decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination the entire country turns against the chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strong willed demeanor works against her every step of the way neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy's case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media
<START> some people say this is the best film that prc ever released i'm not too sure about that since i have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever released br br the plot is simple the ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims the current ferryman she takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves br br shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film listen to the rhythms of the dialog especially in the early scenes their is poetical cadence to them likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death innocence and guilt the film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history br br this isn't to guild the lilly this is a low budget horror mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained its tale of love and revenge is what matters here not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost the technical aspects just being window dressing if there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production the fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land the constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else br br don't get me wrong i do like the film a great deal its a good little film that i some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken its definitely worth a look if you can come across it
<START> this is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an indisputable error in its storytelling while handling the ralphie situation christopher states that he has heard about pie o my's death in the fire accident this is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that christopher knows from the beginning that tony is the one who must have killed ralphie there is however no way chris could have heard about the accident who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his delirium by tony's call nobody else was informed tony knows that which makes it even worse hearing christopher talk about pie o my's death could therefore only lead tony to the conclusion that chris himself has set the fire given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the dvd i really wonder none of them realized the problem there the story just doesn't work that way unnecessary to add that i'm a huge fan of the sopranos otherwise i certainly wouldn't care
<START> when its dvd was released i came to market and bought it and i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it awesome movie what else i can say for will smith he's been an awesome actor like always whether in actions movies or serious always he gives a record braking performance i think this is the movie after august rush which makes a person cry while watching it the way the director described the story was really awesome his previous life and his new life in movie was correctly elaborated to the audience even i could not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it i think its dvd should be a household because this will be really a nice thing for your collection it is not the movie which needs pop corns for enjoyment this is the movie which let the audience learn a lesson now what is the lesson you can see that while watching and i advise those people who are movie critics please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie then please talk to me
<START> hidden frontier is a fan made show in the world of star trek the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta quadrant it has some characters from the official star trek shows but most of them are original to the show the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have the show has good computer animation of spaceships but the acting takes place in front of at green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors not all the actors are equally good but most do fine the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes that is a bit more like in babylon 5 than in most official star trek shows hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using all in all i enjoyed watching it
