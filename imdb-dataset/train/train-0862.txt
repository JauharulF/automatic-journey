<START> 1st watched 8 29 2009 7 out of 10 dir sidney franklin well told account of farmers in china and their rise to prominence and struggles with what mother nature throws at them this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni it chronicles wong long the character played by muni and how he works the land buys more land eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started the relationship between him and his wife played by luise rainer is the main thread of the story besides the land itself and despite the obvious non chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people it's obvious that mgm used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it's pulled off pretty well
<START> one of b and c movie producer roger corman's greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle originally designated for cheap trick rock n' roll high school it's just a simple technically dated story but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny see eaglebauer's van about teenagers who love rock n' roll br br students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal miss evelyn togar played by cult classic favorite mary woronov who fears that rock n' roll turns kids into uncontrollable amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n' roll free zone actually she intends to wipe out rock n' roll for all students regardless of whether its at school and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful br br but not if riff randell pj soles can help it a ramones fanatic she has written some songs including rock n' roll high school that she wants to give to the ramones and in trying to do so is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun hating adults and the teenagers in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge somewhat after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones and others would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated way br br it is mostly mild comedy but a great feel good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you with jerry zucker of airplane fame and joe dante of gremlins fame both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for and not to mention expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale the story must've later inspired and was consequently updated by the mid 90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers kizz br br i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle rock n' roll high school forever released nearly a decade later the original is still the best
<START> first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episode this episode makes a mockery of the entire show br br i don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series br br there is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokes are crap br br the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously on is simply embarrassing br br its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad
<START> kalifornia is a great film that makes us look at ourselves the film has a great cast brad pitt johnny suede a river runs through it and the legends of the fall as early grayce david duchovny the x files as brian kessler michelle forbes star trek the next generation homicide life on the street and escape from l a as carrie loughlin brian's girlfriend and juliette lewis natural born killers cape fear and what's eating gilbert grape as adele corners early's girlfriend br br brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal is getting ready to write a book about serial killers brian and his girlfriend carrie decide they want to move to california so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california to share expenses on the trip br br early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town is in debt owes his landlord money early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job early goes to the college and sees the ad he later tells adele his girlfriend about leaving to go to california early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends carrie and adele become real good friends br br their journey is a very learning one though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question early grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways goes down hill later on and pays the price br br this film is a great movie i give it 10 10 stars and 2 thumbs up i love the songs in the movie especially at the end of the film the song look up to the sky by the indians
<START> what a terrible terrible film one of the worst movies i have seen in my life i usually love movies like this the whole a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes but he happens to already be involved with someone who not right for him i expected something predictable and i didn't mind the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy but not this one every single joke falls flat and the romance makes me want to vomit the title character is one of the most please kill me characters that i have ever witnessed on my television the eccentric woman isn't very eccentric more like quirky and annoying the other someone is the most reasonable mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying this films flat out sucks there's no way around it don't waste your time
<START> this early role for barbara shelley in fact her first in britain after working in italy was made when she was 24 years old and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's cat girl while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention i'll always cherish yutte stensgaard the lovely auburn haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability one such example being 1960's village of the damned in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband george sanders she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of cat people and is seen to great advantage throughout it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase her character apparently sleeps in the nude and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened also exposed 8 years later in 1965's rasputin the mad monk the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder i don't see what held that dress up but i'd sure like to all in all proof positive that barbara shelley in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable a real test of star power which she would find soon enough at hammer's studios in bray for the duration of the 1960's
<START> filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves br br this film is set in glasgow although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent the premise about people who's lives are going nowhere who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs could have made for a really funny insightful quirky cultish film instead we have a group of self obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i'm suprised it hasn't been banned x and y are friends x is sleeping with z y sleeps with z as well oh you figure it out br br a total waste of time painful dialogue it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project the female character was completely superfluous just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it br br if you're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it a right laff everyone else run don't walk away from this sorry little misfit br br and one question when the group left the boring seaside town saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film to go back to glasgow why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england
<START> i first saw this movie as a pre teen about the age when kids start to think through their identity i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one who still prefers her brother br br each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions br br it's a great film even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film
<START> one of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out if i hadn't been with my wife who wanted to stay i would have left it's a shame too because i think it could have been a good movie but this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays i've ever seen it starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere i would say it goes nowhere fast but it really goes nowhere slow painfully slow from time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters but that's all we get hints there is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie not that i need a slick plot to be entertained i love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff but these characters add up to nothing for the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them as a matter of fact you almost start hoping they die because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling but it's not instead of quirky noir esquire characters acting in hard boiled fashion you simply recognize it immediately for what it is a bunch of talented but miscast actors brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context all this for two plodding painfully slow hours awful
<START> this movie was worth five punches on my hurter card i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid '70's i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i've ever seen br br i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was it's box office take end of discussion
<START> after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast furious series so i already expected it to have a lacking storyline but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans unfortunately i was wrong if you could only imagine a fast furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you br br this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen i'm being nice no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said not only was the storyline non existent but the action was crap too i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie for an example there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his girls an imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert after this wonderful scene i couldn't take it anymore so i only got to see half of this monstrosity this is the first movie i had ever walked out on afterwards i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells br br i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option you're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home i will keep all viewers in my prayers
<START> as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face talk about insulting i was writing better stories than this in 8th grade bad acting bad writing bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure br br the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time who would green light something so poorly written it's not artistic clever smart suspenseful mysterious scary dramatic nothing br br the characters are flat and boring with no development the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next pulp fiction this script should have been used to line a bird cage not a movie br br oh and last but not least a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow br br avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std
<START> spoilers galore this is an absolutely awful film first of all it has that guy from medium i guess he's made a career out of playing super doting dads it was ok the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again and so it goes this film moves in excruciating real time at one point i started imaging it was days later until i was reminded that the story line was only at the next day in the early afternoon still i'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life first of all they are presented as sort of a manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid but they drive an old blue volvo those types stopped driving volvos decades ago today they drive priuses but in 2002 i'm sure they still weren't driving volvos br br ok then there's wendigo a mysterious indian man gives the boy a little magic wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic c'mon are we still doing ancient indian mysteries just to drive it home they pan across every indian statue in their tourist trap upstate new york town american indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film oh and about wendigo he is not actually the cause of the horror he doesn't kill the kid's dad which is the most horrible thing in the film he's just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle the wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad oh but wait it seemed earlier that wendigo was kind of mad at the dad maybe because he killed a deer so then wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed but br br and so it goes insulting boring and nonsensical there is no reason to watch this film at all
<START> this may be a bit on the spoilerish side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney made for tv movie br br a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago it's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults plus it's got built in quality sequels but disney fying was not the way to go the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book it is a complicated and emotional story for kids there was no reason to make charles wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs w's as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that there was no reason to remove meg's glasses that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book br br i could nitpick for days about little things but i also think larger things like the art direction was a off take for instance the way they made camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth it looks like earth it has people on it that look like humans the skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing but something is a little bit off the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth that is if we forget how to love it would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm br br i unfortunately did not watch the end maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well br br overall an artistic disappointment br br
<START> why o' why did i pick this one up well i needed a no brainer in the summer heat and the cover looked cool br br of course i should've known better this is a really really bad movie and it gets embarasing when the makers know it's bad and try cover it up by adding some sexy beautiful women and some sex scenes to it well folks it does'nt cut it does it br br if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good well played and funny go rent lake placid that is an order
<START> retitled from its original japanese name of laputa for being an offensive phrase something which director hayao miyazaki was oblivious to at the time castle in the sky is the master animator's third film and it's one of his most beloved of all time initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world inspired by jonathan swift's gulliver's travels castle in the sky is a steampunk themed action adventure tale about two young orphans young miner pazu and mysterious girl sheeta who wears a magic crystal around her neck who team up to find the long lost island of laputa which is rumored to have great riches and gems they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty dola who at first chase them yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost secret agent muska who wants the power of laputa for his own benefit br br for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours this film is an excellent choice featuring just the right amount of humor exploration wonder and mystery to keep one interested the artwork although not as spectacular as in some of miyazaki's later movies is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations incredibly exciting action scenes and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy and while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than miyazaki's other works each has a memorable endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over dola in particular makes for a terrific comic character shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of sheeta the next muska is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain but like dola he commands every scene he's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly br br anime fans have often compared this movie to gainax's sci fi adventure series nadia the secret of blue water after all both works share similar story and character elements not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself where both differ is in their execution nadia although charming for the most part suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot even though it did have a strong ending castle in the sky on the other hand remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time and is all the better for it while the film's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some cartoonish moments like a brawl between pazu's boss and one of dola's sons it's never to the point that it detracts from the film br br about eleven years ago disney released an english version featuring a cast of big names such as james van der beek anna paquin cloris leachman mark hamill mandy patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as tress macneille and jim cummings it also features an ambitious reworking of joe hisaishi's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra interestingly the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself as much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore miyazaki had no such problems in fact he is said to have applauded the reworking and for good reason because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub while there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragon infested storm cloud the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end here hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals br br as far as the performances in the dub go the leads are probably at the short end of the stick james van der beek's pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character while anna paquin's sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character that said both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout it's the lively supporting cast however that really make this dub so much fun particularly cloris leachman's dola and mark hamill's muska both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they're in as with the rescore these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub the script adaptation borders on the loose side at times there's quite a bit of extra lines and or commentary some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone but aside from at least one debatable alteration sheeta's speech in the climactic showdown the world cannot live without love as opposed to the original you can't survive apart from mother earth the overall characters story and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original on the whole there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece and i like them both they're also better than streamline jal's more literal but frightfully robotic lifeless abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980's don't believe anybody who says this version is superior to disneys trust me the opposite is true br br either way though you can't go wrong with castle in the sky it's one of miyazaki's all time greatest and i highly recommend it
<START> foxes is a great film the four young actresses jodie foster cherie currie marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful the song on the radio by donna summer is lovely a great film
<START> in the fan robert de niro plays gil renard or is it travis bickle or rupert pupkin or max cady you see the problem with this type of role is that de niro has played very very similar characters in taxi driver the king of comedy and cape fear and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts i found it slightly difficult to believe that renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho br br the character arc isn't the only problem with this script it also lacks a character focus a problem i had with the untouchables where de niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat for several stretches of the movie i kept thinking that bobby rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to renard it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball i'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon br br i will admit i was entertained by the fan especially by the soundtrack but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in single white female unlawful entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago
<START> along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo sounds familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits tony jay stands out as shere kahn louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book which isn't a bad thing at all as a matter of fact it's quite inspirational the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years please bring this show back 9 10 bethany cox
<START> for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack lack of dialogue clichÃ©s up the wazoo and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film look no farther dreamworks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent or really wanted to create an animated episode of national geographic either way they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie spirit stallion of the cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults and also fails to entertain despite the oh so cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans after looking past the wonderful animations what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess br br spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful as he is a horse that cannot be tamed calmed nor controlled because of this he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high spirited horses which includes his mom but his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country during this spirit never actually named that throughout the entire film almost befriends a courageous native american and a fellow female horse and also has a lot of run ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up br br why must movies mix computer animation with traditional it comes off looking rather meshed something spirited away suffered from as well best example is when a train is chasing after spirit you see the hand drawn spirit running from a computer animated train it would look much better if it were one or the other but not both unless you can really pull off some nice effects beauty and the beast's famous dance sequence uses computer animation but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie the opening sequence was the best looking part of the film kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality a little scene has multiple i mean multiple similar shots of just a general's face quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion br br the kids might enjoy this flick but with lack of dialog song and motivation it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one bryan adams has no place in this movie and why does hans zimmer stay away from using a western theme in this movie when it is a story taking place in the old west soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me at least they are using realistic noises of horses two points for that yet if you are going to refrain from making horses talk why even have a narrator interrupt every so often which just so happens to be the main character himself br br native americans are nice and the western folks are evil native killing horse torturing rowdy psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed more or less this is what spirit is showing us it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the wild west they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives now the person spirit befriended happened to betray him on more than one occasion yet that is forgivable apparently because he is not a soldier that or because he has the sassy female horse br br spirit isn't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk wreaking havoc and even perhaps resulting in some off screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no spirit is in trouble this film gets quite rhythmic as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains kicking people around destroying property freeing horses and then getting captured again all in this same order too the writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie for an old west film they certainly have very little room to roam br br bottom line this is most certainly no disney movie as a matter of fact that is a bad thing even though it was what they were aiming for so instead of the typical musical we get a boring film that becomes predictable dull and slow in multiple instances even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in everything about this movie was just wrong from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil buffoons to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off kill bill vol 2 which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west has more of a western feel than this movie do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary thank you
