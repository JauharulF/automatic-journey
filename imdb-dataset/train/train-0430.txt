<START> this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks one of their most popular tv shows is the running man where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions it's set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky contestants audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom and the host is played by none other than family feud's richard dawson who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role when ben richards arnold is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game br br this movie is chock full of classic arnold one liners such as his famous i'll be back right before he enters the arena and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with how about a light i could go on and on but i don't want to spoil the movie it's funny stuff br br whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today's reality tv craze already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far br br overall this is a fun film i highly recommend it 9 out of 10
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen got so bored that i switched it off midway through to watch the news when i switched it back on i fell asleep the film starts with a dream continues with a dream and ends with a dream then there are a few more dreams in between come on what is supposed to keep me interested in that a film needs to have a reason to be interesting the minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film goer switches off ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them this is it br br absolutely awful
<START> bye bye birdie isn't one of the best musicals of all time but it's great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role but instead they tinkered with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this re make which aired on abc in 1995 is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking who choreographed this film br br jason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie a role he played on the national tour br br this film is not without it's problems though a major liability is chynna phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show with br br but all in all this is a delightful well done film which the material deserved
<START> terry gilliam's fantastic twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic dizzying and highly stylized film that boasts bruce willis' best performance ever br br what sets 12 monkeys apart from most time travel sci fi movies is that bruce willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time travel that is not knowing what reality is actual reality the place that the time traveler comes from or goes to also the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event in this case the release of said virus cannot be stopped or changed as willis asserts it's already happened while he's in a mental hospital the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite overdone plot to save the world instead it's willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself it's a fresh innovative concept and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by peoples and gilliam's unique brand of dementia br br besides this 12 monkey's storytelling is totally non linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences flashbacks dreams memories the present the past the future and even a scene that is lifted out of hitchcock's vertigo all serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility br br visually gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling tim burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery with cold wide and immersing cinematography gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters the scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering on madness characters br br performance wise brad pitt steals most scenes filling them with a patented loony off the wall performance that deservedly garnered him an oscar nomination as mentioned bruce willis gives the best performance of his career not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying cole as a simple poignant tragic everyman equally good is madeline stowe as willis' psychologist she holds her own injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion ' br br gilliam's expert overwhelming and complex handling of what could have been a routine action sci fi film makes 12 monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish futuristic landscape its rich well thought out intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness ranking in my top 10 of all time 12 monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance br br 10 out of 10
<START> i won't describe the story as that has been done elsewhere we are great clive owen fans and when our netflix recommended the movie we were intrigued br br no wonder we had never heard of this movie because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 hence the poor production values grainy image jerky camera work and poor sound br br but you don't really mind the mechanics because the story itself will put you to sleep it's an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending you don't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile
<START> this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue what sense does that make this film isn't alone most films seem to do this now for 2 years i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv but then i got a new tv there it is again background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue br br it was even more distracting in this film because in the english version anyway the woman mumbles constantly i kept hoping jean reno would say excuse me would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth if you watch it on dvd you have even high school french i recommend the french version with subtitles br br i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon people rave about the scenery but i saw it on a tv i lived in the rockies for a few years so enh
<START> screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title ' come undone' april 25 26 27 2001 the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling even with fall winter backgrounds for the 'present' and spring summer for the 'flashbacks' there can be some difficulty following the continuity br br whether either lead is gay the actors well portray the budding relationship in real life terms from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning but as the end approaches you really care about where these guys will be next summer you too will want a sequel to find out
<START> simply put the movie is boring clichÃ© upon clichÃ© is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship br br all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie
<START> cute idea salesgirl linda smith yolande donlan inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra that country which wasn't even in north america was made the 49th state of course there were only 48 states at the time since this was made in 1952 linda travels to the country she has inherited and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people at one point she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo and it gets ever more sillier from there although yolande donlan's heavy lipstick and omni present smile never get ruffled or shmeared there are other songs scattered through out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor or some such equivalent about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig cheese vendor bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war and was even knighted by qe ii craig and the new princess keep bumping into each other and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra's financial problems worsen fun little farce along the lines of marx brothers film also note that donlan later married val guest the writer and director of our little project and stayed married for 50 years guest was better known for writing and directing his sci fi flicks in both the uk the us
<START> this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945 br br honest and to the point this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high low and turning points in the allies fortunes being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain but russia and america's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length br br another worthy mention is the score the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil struggle and perseverance like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the germans during the war its build to a climax at the end of every episode which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation
<START> carl brashear cuba gooding jr was born to sharecroppers in the deep south he joins the navy whereupon he tells his father he will be back the father gives him an old radio and brashear leaves on the navy bus the most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was never quit after a recommendation from a white commander powers boothe who admires his drive and guts he gets sent to navy diving school at bayonne nj he endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer chief navy master diver billy sunday robert de niro and from the commanding officer called pappy hal holbrook who has almost as many loose screws as an old car they all want to make him drop out and the prejudice is quite fierce the dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship despite this setback he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective and with the help of billy sunday now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings they train and he is able to become the first black navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the navy department hearing in washington dc to determine if he meets the criteria an inspirational movie showing that determination can overcome all odds
<START> this was a waste of 75 minutes of my life the acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous it revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her and then blackmails them for money one of the victims is a candidate for da which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife another is a plastic surgeon also married and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too meanwhile the evil lesbian's girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around it ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven the women get naked a lot too mostly in situations that stretch reality bad bad bad
<START> of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing so rodolfo sonego did if you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories my uncle visited australia and my town in 1968 to check out locations for a girl in australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war you can see his humor in all his movies i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently great
<START> i'm a big fan of lucio fulci many of his giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time but this made for tv movie is extremely sub par and not what i've come to expect from the great italian director the film is neither interesting like some of fulci's more tame giallo's or gory like the majority of his cult classics thus leaving it lacking in both major areas and ultimately ensuring that the film isn't very good the film works from a plot that has been used many times previously but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife which is the ultimate unknown this film focuses on giorgio mainardi a man that isn't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage there aren't many people that are sad to see him go this means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter br br the video that i saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is in the style of hp lovecraft and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film i've ever seen there is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the stuart gordon lovecraft film 'from beyond' which is a lot better the film does benefit from a distinctly italian style and the score is rather good unfortunately however fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it and so the theme quickly becomes annoying the plot plays out in a really boring way and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members this movie was made for italian tv and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame there's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies but this isn't the fulci we all know and love overall this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of fulci's talents not worth bothering with unless you're a fulci completist
<START> when i saw this film on fearnet i thought it would be a scary movie apparently it wasn't i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site fearnet is a site that shows scary horror movies br br the acting is wonderful from all the actors i hated the story the story was stupid the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen the water turns to blood the oceans die out the moon turns red etc br br the female character was annoying as well a lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it coincidentally it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means br br spoiler alert br br the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it br br here's what happens the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child she touches her child's head transferring her soul into the child and then dies then the apocalypse stops br br why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby br br end spoiler br br the movie is pretty stupid it's another religious end of the world propaganda piece the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent that's about all there is br br i give this movie 2 stars out of 10 good acting with a lot of nonsense
<START> 80 minutes and it felt twice that long brief crossing is not brief enough indeed the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue more of a monologue really of a woman approaching middle age tediously droning about men disappointment sex aging and her recent breakup to a french teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria br br the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty free shop and to a bar where finally her self involved rant pushes him away the story can't end there of course so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin br br what little romance sex or for that matter anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all yes the ending is very nicely done but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner br br of course some people like it i could be wrong
<START> this is a really funny and sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting it's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movie's more serious parts it's a unique movie about two doctors and i don't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great wood harris' character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it go you won't be disappointed it's worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award
<START> simply but imaginatively filmed studio set performance short a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip the precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session what it is is a pop video every bit as stylised and knowing as that implies and all the better for it among the very best music films ever made and almost certainly the most cinematic these cats are solid gone daddy o
<START> first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian the cambodian edison aka pang goes around killing people to survive himself has done it throughout his entire life sam lee's wai duty is to capture the cambodian for good there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it the movie shows the struggles between those two characters they both beat each other like angry dogs go and watch ppl strongly suggessted go hk films
<START> visually disjointed and full of itself the director apparently chose to seek faux depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore fest br br the moments that work in this film are very limited and the characters don't even feel real how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal br br substantively and stylistically it all feels like a quirky dream sequence jarring irregular camera work awkward silences and gaps in action and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school it added no meaning just cheese and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film assuming the film even had a style which is a close call what a flop
