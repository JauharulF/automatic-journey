<START> my observations postwar hilarity tom drake and grandpa from meet me in st louis two years later the year i was born donna reed charming and pretty margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in wizard of oz spring byington way prettier also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious as a two year veteran of army tents he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes br br i used to work in a department store and it was just as elegant as this one sadly it has disappeared and faded into obscurity we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise br br 10 10
<START> republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er werecat genre the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancÃ© ends up dead complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not br br okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top hatted killer he's the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it as good as the talk is i just wished someone would do something when it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late br br take a pass
<START> cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters one day a ball is to be held in honor of the prince but cinderella has no chance of going because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her with the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends she is off to the ball with the warning to return home by midnight at the ball she meets the handsome prince charming when the clock strikes midnight she runs home leaving behind one of her glass slippers with the help of her animal friends her true identity is revealed she and the prince later get married and they live happily ever after br br cinderella released 56 years ago was a huge box office success and it continues to charm audiences to this day it has a well written script the characters are memorable the songs including a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and the great bibbidi bobbidi boo help tell the story this was my favorite movie growing up and it hasn't lost any of its charm a true disney masterpiece recommended 10 10 p s the recent dvd release is the best way to appreciate this film including featurettes deleted scenes music video vintage radio programs and a restored print of the movie
<START> this is one of those feel good saturday afternoon movies it's right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up and it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson not to mention joquin phoenix br br i personally really like movies like this from time to time nothing too deep or too scary just a nice story line and i would have never known mr phoenix had i not recently read the credits he was just a baby really when he made this movie br br kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie i agree it's not an oscar caliber movie but very much worth watching especially if you have kids in the let's say 8 to 11 year old range or ones that are interested in the space program
<START> lame movie completely uninteresting no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum they manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies the scene where hartnett grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty it just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruel br br some subplots weren't even explored they were just used as filler why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes why and on what grounds is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist for some reason even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer's house to jack up his own commission they keep coming back to him anyway they knew he lied to both of them yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for stupid just stupid this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders there they were just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover amazing that they didn't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each br br the scriptwriting was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett it fails miserably and ford's phone turn the damn thing off how many times could it ring in a 2 hour movie 50 60 it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie every 30 seconds that stupid tune would play and if it wasn't ford's then hartnett's was ringing it was incredibly annoying br br complete waste of time ford's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career
<START> a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to burst into flames br br i was really geared up for this film what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad dourif unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual with violent powers movie spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much the special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale br br the cast isn't bad dourif does steal the show br br all around no classic but it's not the worst of its kind either br br out of
<START> i was around 7 when i saw this movie first it wasn't so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot br br i think the best parts of the film are yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also br br if you wanna watch this movie don't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from approx 1000 dollars br br i've a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas br br watch it enjoy it yeti for ever
<START> i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies hey no one wants to get typecast but danny glover brenda fricker happy birthday brenda and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the outfield is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain lowly escapism examples of high escapism are the various sci fi movies from the '50s if these movies had some political undertone or at least offered us a new look at life then they would be ok this one is just pointless far closer to diabolical than angelic also starring tony danza adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes
<START> i was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the royal families of britain and their history and she won't go to the cinema without me although viewers shouldn't expect to be electrified this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none in many ways it helps dispel the myth that victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs she was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years a fun loving happy young woman her love of albert was the essence of true love and even if you only count the number of children she bore 9 they must have had a passionate relationship all of this is well borne out in the film to this end the cast has been well selected with both emily blunt and rupert friend giving sound performances as victoria and albert br br spoiler alert the historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did prince albert get shot while defending victoria there was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together but nobody was struck by the shot s i also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between victoria's mother and sir john conroy it is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for victoria's distaste for both her mother and conroy i also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between victoria and lord melbourne as erring on the romantic or at least having the potential to become romantic he was already in his late 50's when victoria came to the throne and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era the movie portrays melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to prince albert there were apparently rivals to albert but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life and albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case br br all in all i have spent worse times at the cinema and brownie points with my wife can't be a bad thing either
<START> dragon fighter is the first sci fi channel although i guess it's now called syfy original movie i have ever seen but i have seen one or two others since and i can tell you that they were stupid but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel the cgi is done poorly the acting is bad the script is ridiculous and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place if you have seen dragon fighter you probably know what i mean i didn't want to put a spoiler in my review plus there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence that was really stupid they just played it over and over and it's definitely not original i know i've heard that somewhere before i just can't remember where this is one to avoid
<START> i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed the word vagina says it all a body part nothing shocking here i could say to my doctor my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis or my vagina hurts after cycling with equal or more social commentary it could be the tricep monologues for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard the monologues were dull but delivered with drama the topics were outdated and i was alternately bored and annoyed once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn't when i was supposed to surely this isn't really a hit oh and spoilers there was a lesbian oh wait maybe not come to think of it and inappropriate fondling and a crack mama that about covers it
<START> from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life the idea of two giant robots manned by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script let's just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures combined the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is robot jox
<START> who doesn't know largo winch in the france belgium luxemburg trio the three countries where the french bd or bandes dessinÃ©es are massively published 18 years after the publication of the first comic book which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels it had to be adapted on screens after a first and failed attempt with a tv show the real thing begins br br first of all and that's what most of the fans didn't get the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series some essential parts characters and actions of the original are missing the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series as a 1st class fan of the comic book i must confess i was nicely surprised the actors are good so is the scenario though it might seem too fast i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial political thrillers but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet
<START> my children watch the show everyday that its on its a great program for younger children however they need to stop showing re runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney's and deedee's yellow teeth moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at and one other thing if we might be able to add moe you need to stop hiding so much sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope what does that signify other then getting wet all the time they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole kids loose interest that way
<START> when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of the lost boys 1987 to my surprise to die for is a really good movie it's a little bit corny at times but still there are enough stylish set pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times highly recommended
<START> most people miss hollywood's point of concept if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage br br in all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman spiderman and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the 'man of bronze'
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for 5 on vhs she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas that's right satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesn't make it back to his home in space he turns to powder don't get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy
<START> first of all i loved bruce broughton's music score very lyrical and this alone added to the film's charm the best aspect of the movie were the three animals superlatively voiced by michael j fox sally field and the late don ameche whereas fox has the funniest lines ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character the voice of reason and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off the humans weren't as engaging and sometimes the film dragged but that is my only complaint this is one beautiful looking film with beautiful close up shots of canada i believe although the film itself is quite long there is never a seriously dull moment and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well written script all in all a charming and perhaps underrated film with a 9 10 from me bethany cox
<START> what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the transgenered br br the title of this movie didn't catch my eye it was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all fearless filmmakers
<START> pandora's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see a highly faithful adaptation of john j nance's novel which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel is made even more so here br br despite being made for tv this is first rate entertainment the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor daphne zuniga is great as dr sanders and despite the character being a man in the book it works incredibly well robert loggia edward herrmann robert guillaume and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter br br there are changes to the story of course including and a slight change in the ending but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago they work fine sets are great especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work br br it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel this will leave you breathless
