<START> now this film isn't going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller one well that's three reasons isn't it br br the first reason this is interesting is the special effects i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular to see the hair growing on marsha a hunt and sybil danning was creepy especially when they were participating in a mÃ©nage Ã  trois br br of interest is the fact that this marsha hunt is the famous brown sugar of the rolling stones song and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair br br besides the special effects there were two other points of note in this film and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits i lost count but i swear that sybil danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film
<START> i have to agree with most of the other posts was it a comedy a drama to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name in new york how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold again a comedy or drama but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously she is a younger actress that is going to be viable
<START> despite its rather salacious title this is a light teen dramedy unless you're an old coot you'll probably find it likeable it isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many i know but i've always liked the more obscure maddie corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown ups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike
<START> i am an actor producer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i don't think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you were you smoking crack i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history
<START> the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy one by one the blood is drained from those involved in the dig br br to be as brief as possible pharaoh's curse is quite the lackluster affair while the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking mummy's soul transference interesting make up effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding to make matters even worse the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but pharaoh's curse tests even my patients the cast helps very little with only one exception ziva rodann is the lone bright spot Â wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay finally i don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy looking servant in what appears to be pajamas but it's a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience br br despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse i'm going to rate it a 4 10 not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems i have with the movie
<START> director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character based sci fi flicks with his 1997 short film elevated wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building his follow up feature project cube released later that year had a very similar premise this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps both were admirable attempts to take the sci fi genre a step further by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element how the characters act react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's cypher natali has come back to his bizarre character film trend to bring us nothing his latest and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of what if br br dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller are life long friends brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with dave who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature lives rent free with andrew at his ill located and ill constructed house where he often takes advantage of andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality despite all this the two misfits are happy together until one day their deep character flaws coupled with some astronomically bad luck land them in the middle of some pretty serious jail sentence worthy trouble on top of this they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset so in the hazy nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them they wish that the whole world would just disappear and it does br br going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow occasionally too slow reveal about what's happened to dave and andrew and how they deal with their new reality natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress ala the birds is here in spades but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers he's able to break away from the thriller horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level it's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of cube br br of course the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine in keeping with fundamental realism our two anti heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic sometimes with rather nasty results like the desert island game the film looks at how even best friends when left alone together can fall apart but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence in a very twisted sci fi way this is a feel good flick with good heart and good intentions br br however there are a few qualms to be had with nothing while the two lead actors hewlett and miller do well with their parts their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew some background is given but ultimately not enough a generous viewer will sit through the less engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end but cynics will probably give up pretty fast br br acting as mentioned is adequate and considering the amount of 'green screen' work that would've been needed reasonably convincing david hewlett and andrew miller who both wrote co wrote the screenplay have been long time friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction nonetheless the story could have been a lot more involving granted it is relatively entertaining considering that no pun intended nothing really happens but you get the impression that in more experienced hands a lot more could've been done with this premise br br in all fairness nothing is an impressive piece of work in many ways the concept is interesting the direction is inventive the script works on a human level and most of all it shows a progression in natali's creative mentality for fans of his work this will be a delight and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time it's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great fun film it could have been
<START> badly made dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gijÃ³n film festival br br everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i what was the point of even making the film the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly i am astonished that this film has been given a release very very disappointing and a waste of my time sorry terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film now that could have been interesting
<START> who wouldn't want to go on road trip with peter falk that guy's right eye has more character than most actors today this is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores women are going to love it for all the wake up romance advice for men and men will love it for its spot on father son character study one great little scene after another and it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find obviously this is a labor of love for paul reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life the most fun part though was watching reiser watch falk you could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying peter falk's special craft really delightful let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with paul reiser and folks
<START> there are laughs in this film that is for sure michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny before he decided he was a serious actor however what bothers me so much about this film is how unlikable practically all of the characters are other than the main two leads everybody is a jerk i mean these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get you just watch and think man these losers should be unemployed moreover the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese nationalists oh sure in the end they all come together as one but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there
<START> first off i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget sci fi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was a mindless hour and a half the cg was not as bad as i was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years sounds like a good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and a very small actual war between dragons rather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thing along with all 5 of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest i've seen a lot of b movies like reptilian the cave spider and others but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour watch this br br story 1 10 cg 5 10 acting 3 10 br br i don't drink but it would have helped before watching this movie
<START> jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town br br i don't think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick just put your brain on hold and have fun with it but just don't take it too seriously
<START> boy oh boy oh golly gee br br the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom's invisibility they looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie br br i did not end up loving this movie the attempted steadicam shots were really pathetic as well i mean hey if they had a low budget flick that's fine you can still make a great movie with a low budget but a bad movie and a low budget and effects that makes for a bad combination in this case such a doomed combo created the craptastic film invisible mom if you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one
<START> this ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the autumn of 1993 i'd say that was a shame but then again some of the better movies are quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise br br diane lane kevin pollack elizabeth perkins vincent spano julie warner bill paxton kimberly williams matt craven and alan arkin who is painfully good here are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good bad and funny memories of summers gone past this film covers the gambit of emotions mostly pleasant and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own since i am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly brazen manipulation in films this is something that i appreciate from writer director mike binder br br this film's a great cheap rent a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick you might run across this on tv and i would definitely suggest a look see
<START> r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way this time it is mixed with mature humors br br amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job according to him cooking is an art still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properly br br enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each otherÂ amitabh is 65 and tabu is 35Â no probs but one hitch tabu's father paresh rawal the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage but amitabh realizes that tabu's father is much younger to him and the complications beginÂ performance wise all three actors are brilliant the script of the film is very tight and interesting the dialogues of the film are catchy but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled the comedy is sometimes not properly understood the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts br br musically nothing much to sing about except the title track the camera work is good director r balki could have given much better from this script but in the second half he himself looks confused the satyagrah scene of the father looked irritating but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthy br br on the whole cheeni kum needed to have more sugar
<START> this movie basks too much in its own innocence it doesn't tell a story it's more a big time snooze fest while the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller
<START> this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who after his fiance is decapitated goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail particularly our protagonist
<START> a family traveling for their daughter's softball league decide to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nowhere the father is an avid photographer and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town he decides to take another detour to take some photographs br br of course the side show is filled with inbred freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves br br the only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors other than that there's nothing worthwhile about the film
<START> as a spiritualist and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from atheists and jews and who are all these street people he's interviewing who don't know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti christ told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums
<START> this was the second of two filmed hamlets in the nineties the first being franco zeffirelli's starring mel gibson from 1990 zeffirelli's version like laurence olivier's from 1948 was based upon an abridged version of the play with much of shakespeare's original text being cut i have never seen tony richardson's 1969 version but as that ran to less than two hours shorter even than zeffirelli's i presume that was also abridged kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious a film based on the complete text of the play with a running time of around four hours br br with his henry v branagh claimed olivier's crown as the cinema's leading shakespearean confirming his claim with his brilliant much ado about nothing a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy hamlet was his third shakespeare film as director he also acted as iago in oliver parker's 1995 othello and as one might expect it is very different to much adoÂ the earlier film shot in a villa in the hills of tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside is a joyous summertime film about everything that makes life worth living br br hamlet by contrast is set in the depths of winter the flowers in the description of ophelia's death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer the look of the film is particularly striking both sumptuous and chilly it was filmed at blenheim palace possibly england's most grandiose stately home but also a rather forbidding one the snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry the interior ones formal and elaborate the action is updated to the mid nineteenth century the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms there is a contrast here with zeffirelli's film where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone the play is dominated by images of corruption and decay branagh's intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying something rotten in the state of denmark br br the film is notable for the large number of big name actors some of them in very minor roles blink and you might miss john gieldgud or judi dench apparently an all star cast was required by the production company who were nervous about a four hour film some of the imported hollywood stars such as robin williams' osric did not really come off but others like charlton heston's player king or billy crystal's first gravedigger played their parts very well yorick normally only seen as a skull is here seen in flashback played by the british comedian ken dodd brian blessed who often plays jovial characters is cast against type as the ghost and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening br br of the major characters perhaps the weakest was kate winslet's ophelia branagh's leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995 i did however find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role although winslet came into her own in the ophelia's mad scenes she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane i preferred helena bonham carter in zeffirelli's version richard briers plays polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool julie christie also brings dignity to the role of gertrude there is no attempt here as there was with gibson and glenn close in the zeffirelli version to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and hamlet an interpretation which owes more to freud than it does to shakespeare the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son which was certainly not the case with close and gibson olivier's gertrude eileen herlie was bizarrely thirteen years younger than him br br branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy much stress is placed upon the war with norway and the norwegian prince fortinbras a subplot ignored altogether by zeffirelli this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of claudius sometimes played as a one dimensional villain there is something about derek jacobi's performance which suggests that claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother but chose to rule as a bad king although he is tormented by guilt he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done br br branagh a wonderfully fluent speaker of shakespeare's verse is superb in the main role like gibson he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as indecisive passive and melancholy his is an active physical energetic hamlet something best shown in his fatal duel with laertes his guiding principle is not world weary despair but an active disgust with evil and corruption br br it was a gamble for branagh to make a four hour epic and the film did not do well at the box office it was however praised by many critics james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic my own opinion is that whatever the financial returns may have been branagh's gamble paid off in artistic terms by concentrating on the full text he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeare's most complex play when i reviewed his much adoÂ i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy his hamlet may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy 10 10
