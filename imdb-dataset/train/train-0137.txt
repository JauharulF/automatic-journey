<START> although she is little known today deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much admired operatic singing voice this 1937 was her first major film and it proved a box office bonanza for beleaguered universal studios br br three smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long unseen father when their still faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry with the firm intention of undermining his gold digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother although the story is slight the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger alice brady lucile watson and mischa auer round out the cast a an ultra light amusement for fans of 1930s film br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show in american in paris he choreographs some outstanding numbers some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at check out gene kelly's getting out of bed routine for starters br br gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich woman's gigolo but he really loves someone else hoary story sure but the musical numbers save the show here i really loved georges guÂ¨Â¦tary's voice work in this one his 'stairway to paradise' and his duet with le gene on 's wonderful' is 's marvelous' oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave all in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie
<START> it's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions at times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans even lying about how they don't charge their clients while they are wearing their gold watches the 'donation' box is mandatory notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases br br keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee while the average salary in india is 1 700 ru month
<START> the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where i mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film overall the movie wasn't good at all and i don't recommend it
<START> cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run of the mill sci fi flick the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on the close up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive the sci fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props br br the character development is intentionally shallow the main character jeremy northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
<START> this was a great movie even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great my friend and i laughed a lot my mom even enjoyed it there was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol and when she gets her roadster and ned is there yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol go see it i bet you'll enjoy it i really enjoyed it and so did my friend br br people were so tough on this movie and they hadn't even seen it i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance they all did a great job in my opinion but if you have young kids its still appropriate i will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too
<START> we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan dom that i have never before approached one of the most intense thrills of non mainstream movie adulation at least as far as i am concerned is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure i remember how as a teenager i longed to see eddie's revenge of the dead a k a night of the ghouls which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman's a night to dismember or half the works of jesus franco however recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible even for those of us on the 'wrong' side of the atlantic br br and then behold there was i woke up early the day i died a movie that should have been so 'big' yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite the 1990s needed a hard to find movie though which would really be worth hunting out and this to be sure is it i don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film its classy yet kitsch cast its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals its wondrous moments of pure cinema in the sense of the 1920s french cineastes and surrealism or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here br br what i do wish to mention briefly is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost lost to us but thankfully not quite movie i think the german video which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter's day is fairly well known to ed wood's followers now it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released however there is thankfully more to be found firstly there are a number of reviews available from the film's german theatrical release i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to woodify my students some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film's artistry and entertainment value and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions secondly there is the score by larry groupe' which can be acquired from the man himself many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener particularly if you are contemplating the film's currently vaulted status and growing a little melancholy at the same time finally for now i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers beg borrow steal kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these it features 14 tracks from the film including eartha kitt's ballad the late darcy clay's jesus i was evil two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand although that is another story again the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv the latter being billy z's very own techno band br br become obsessed let ed wood rule your life
<START> there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made br br why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another cases in point mister magoo the avengers awful br br christopher lloyd whom i normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal his ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character br br the director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants br br fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script i think the writer used it's a mad mad mad mad world as an example of a fine comedy script as manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison br br what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children i just am not sure whose children it was made for certainly no self respecting card carrying child i know br br if they had to remake my favorite martian why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic br br unfortunately imdb com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty br br one good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid i think
<START> i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i'm usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i'm not sure why perhaps it's that i don't want kevin bacon to be evil and there's disappointment in that but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 perhaps 12 if they are mature
<START> nothing's more enjoyable for me than a who dun it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end and that's precisely what happens in deathtrap based on a chilling play by ira levin rosemary's baby br br and in it michael caine and christopher reeve get to do the kind of stunt that caine and laurence olivier pulled off in sleuth with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play br br but because it's meant to scare you surprise you and keep you guessing as to the outcome it's difficult to write a review about the plot let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present michael caine is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably when a young aspiring writer christopher reeve sends him the manuscript of his play caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back br br from that point on it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as ira levin's story unwinds managing to trump agatha christie for the number of twists br br caine and reeve play off each other brilliantly each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humor br br summing up well worth seeing but not everyone is pleased with the ending
<START> radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century the movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced one of happiness and excitement sadness and grief the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international playing their dreams our dreams radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours
<START> i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
<START> like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies if you asked me to name a good gangster movie i'd have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that film is the general unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name this is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it's more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor br br like goodfellas 1990 and american gangster 2007 Âtwo superior mob moviesÂ the general is based on real people and true events the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill brendan gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult meanwhile the police led by an inspector named kenny jon voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him br br perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous goodfellas 1990 and the first two godfather films i was expecting too much from the general but that may be going too easy on it this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented for some reason director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full fledged color film now i have nothing against b w pictures not even ones made in modern day times schindler's list 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and it's a masterpiece the general made just five years after schindler's list is not the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that i found simply annoying the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentary like style like schindler's list did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classic style motion picture performances in the film range from passable to poor brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting the sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime noir appeal but that also fails because again it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place br br but the worst thing that occurs is that there's not oneÂnot oneÂcharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for in fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okayÂso what moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time consuming here i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did if a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing no remorse no relief no surprise nothing we just say so what and that's all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorly made crime film
<START> 2 stars and i'm being generous minor spoilers look this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland as the plot goes a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive by br br the main problem with this movie what zombies all the zombies do is growl which doesn't sound even remotely scary and drip fake red blood from their mouths no scary eyes no decaying flesh just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots br br the cover is also misleading there are only about 6 zombies in the whole film so it's not like the whole hood is plagued with zombies or anything it's just a few and is contained in no time br br the acting actually is so bad it's hilarious no one can act at all in this movie except maybe one of the gang members and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together decided to cast their family and made a movie one weekend br br final note since when do doctors wear tracksuits skip this one please
<START> this drummond entry is lacking in continuity most of them have their elements of silliness the postponed wedding and so on however this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another the house seems more like a city there's also leo g carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no one seems to even look at he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but drummond and the folks don't seem to pick up on anything still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending br br i know that algie is supposed to be a comic figure but like nigel bruce in the rathbone sherlock holmes flicks he is so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him is there a history behind him that will explain how he and drummond became associates
<START> well cube 1997 vincenzo's first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i've ever seen when talking about movies they had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot so what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth his second movie cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasn't so good as cube but here are the characters being tested like rats again br br nothing is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his 'cube days' locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room but instead of a thriller sci fi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we're living once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing 2 actors and a blinding white scenario that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that while cube is a claustrophobic experience and cypher confusing nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate br br this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws there's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since cube
<START> generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer extended maybe to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to tristan's brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it
<START> there isn't one decent scene br br amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time proof that you a can start anywhere the guy playing sebastian sucks too he doesn't even look much like ryan phillipe more like joshua jackson the two other girls are terrible as well br br then the dialogue is also crap br br sebastian about to have threesome if you cant beat them br br virgin girl who says you can't beat 'em br br lame br br the ending contradicts the entire plot of the original in the first film it is clearly stated that kathryn and sebastian never had sex one of the reasons sebastian wanted kathryn so bad aside from the fact that she's played by sarah michelle gellar was that she was the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him she was a tease who liked playing with him the fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting then in this p o s it implies that he can have her along with a girl on the side what and we don't even see the sex either it's implied making it not only stupid pointless and contradictory but worthless too br br and in the first one kathryn rejects sebastian because he fell in love making him a loser even though he won the bet that crumbled his chances then in this excrement he looses and falls in love so she doesn't screw losers only complete losers another thing it's stated that sebastian has never been in love so what do you call the thing with virgin girl br br then at the end virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be kathryn's evil lesbian lover dun dun dun and like i said they go into a lame offscreen threesome stupid br br there's several other plot contradictions did the writer even see the first film a 5 year old can point his stuff out br br after the threesome sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while kathryn and virgin girl turned evil lesbian in lame sudden plot twist sit in the front listen and smile evilly into the camera br br the end br br seeing sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film i guess all it took to make little sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls interesting
<START> one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films great music by irving berlin solid support from randolph scott harriet nelson lucille ball betty grable frank jenks and astrid allwyn br br terrific songs include let yourself go let's face the music and putting all my eggs in one basket the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers rogers also sings let yourself go with grable among the backup singers br br harriet nelson then hilliard sings two nice songs and plays rogers' mousy sister get thee behind me is a song that sticks with you for days she also sings but where are you snappy and fast paced this entry in the astaire rogers series is one of the better ones the classic and amazing beautiful finale let's face the music and dance is among the best known of their numbers rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances weighted hem and is also slightly see through just gorgeous this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re created in pennies from heaven br br randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire's pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok br br rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with let yourself go jazzy and thumping it's a great song br br fun all the way although i got tired of we joined the navy after the third time
<START> grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget
