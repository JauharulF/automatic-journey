<START> i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940's who must have lived this story
<START> excellent pre code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired by writings of nietzsche to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself use men to her advantage not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power stanwyck even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here ever driving herself and the film forward not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risquÃ© situations and astonishing quips and innuendo great fun if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female still that's life
<START> this film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town and the word of mouth buzz got me to see it a comedy about disabled people the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart warming film
<START> the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the farmer's father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speak br br it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans
<START> it is enjoyable and fast paced br br there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen however the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy br br while his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well balanced and worked very well br br it is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian
<START> i really liked this film when it was released and i still do because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general and people too one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan in addition to the positive vibes from the film there are other reasons to like grand canyon for one thing it has an outstanding cast kevin kline and danny glover for example in my opinion crash the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture was very similar to this film the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive crash had the opposite effect with me it was very dark i would choose grand canyon over crash any day
<START> lion king 1 1 2 is a very fun and addictive sequel don't expect the production values of a theatrical release but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release br br it is set up as timon pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story this is done with frequent comedic interruptions for example during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote these little moments pepper the movie and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie than this may not be your cup of tea br br animation is the best they've invested in the disney dtv line and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material the newer independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original the voice talents are all well performed though i couldn't help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner br br many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive br br the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature the toe tapping opening feature of 'dig a tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious timon and pumba's take on the lion king's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing the only problem was the reprise of the 'dig a tunnel' at the end of the movie switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting br br story line is pretty well done and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little the new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well and does better when it is resorting to full comedy br br overall worth purchasing if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2 disc set then go for it for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away br br damion crowley
<START> the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement br br if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs br br i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek l'engle said of the film 'i expected it to be bad and it is ' br br i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind
<START> seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran trampa infernal is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot the zero boys the film is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck unfortunately there is not much gore so fans of grand guignol will be disappointed however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look mexican horror flicks are quite obscure i have seen only alucarda and don't panic so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher my rating 7 out of 10 highly recommended
<START> man's castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration the proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a hooverville br br spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco the start of a slew of classic roles he's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in loretta young br br one of the things about man's castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men women had some additional strains put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal spence takes loretta young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle pretty soon though they're in love though tracy is not the kind to settle down br br the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of man's castle and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously br br also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp marjorie rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl a really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well hohl brings the plot of man's castle to its climax through his scheming br br man's castle is grim look at the great depression not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment
<START> helena bonham carter is the center of this movie she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity kenneth branagh was tolerable the movie itself was good not exceptional if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing
<START> and yet we were told there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go br br why oh why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer director to snip snip snip apparently that writer director has previously done shorts as a short this would have been okay but the lack of dialogue starts to grate after twenty minutes the lack of much music glares the background noises talking traffic and especially a ubiquitous helicopter get old really fast but the worst failure is in story there is precious little beyond a short br br after an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again i nearly screamed at the screen we get it we get it it's amazing that after that left the theatre we could drive home watch the daily show and parts of the colbert report get ready for bed and know that the audience was still trapped in the theatre br br it's not enough to indulge your vision you have to give the audience enough to share your vision
<START> first of all f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft br br secondly the f14's and f18's cannot change their appearances they are not transformers br br thirdly the f16 has only one m61 cannon not two br br last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 br br when students hand in really bad work teachers assign 0's now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a '0 10' option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10
<START> humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped
<START> wasn't sure what to expect from this film i love watching brosnan in any movie he's always good but this was totally different he's a mess and plays being a mess very well in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni so yes there's not a lot of violence there's not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and it's pretty funny too i don't think you'll come out of the cinema going wow i was blown away but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film can't ask for more than that br br oh and if you're lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you'll get inverted upside down reversed with reversed audio adverts brilliant nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary
<START> i wont take too much time here just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome i have all 3 on dvd added these to my collection of dvd movie sets darkman ranks up there with the best like indiana jones aliens star wars die hard you get the point there isn't too many good horror thriller sets out there many thanks to the whole crew and set for giving us the darkman trilogy by the way if your wondering how i came across this one on dvd i purchased it through the internet it is however region 4 as you know most us dvd players are region 1 if you own a sony playstation 2 you have the best dvd player since it is an all region player just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want 1 9
<START> i would never have thought i would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound thanks to martin scorsese i did the movie was from f borzage you will start to understand if it's not already the case what makes a good movie
<START> another british cinema flag waver real garbage on offer here once again i cannot understand and i am british why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended other commenter's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage this is extremely poorly observed the archive footage is in abundance model aircraft swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind the usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole malta event guinness must have his worst acting performance ever the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area ealing made many great movies this clearly is not one of them they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot
<START> the 40 year old virgin is about andy stitzer a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women some of his co workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that andy is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity one day in the store andy meets a woman named trish who gives him her phone number and eventually andy works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but andy is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to trish much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward the 40 year old virgin has good direction a good script good comedic performances by the whole cast good cinematography and good film editing the film stars and is co written by steve carell who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too i was very pleasantly surprised with this film it is sweet funny entertaining fun enjoyable clever good natured and a good time this film is just as good as this year's wedding crashers and both films are two of the best comedies i have seen in awhile the 40 year old virgin really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun one of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year
<START> the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel or at least a remake if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating stupid buster wand combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy
