<START> the marriage of maria braun mmb is about a german girl maria getting married to a german soldier herman braun just at the ending of the war after being married for half a day and a night herman is send to the front again to make ends meet maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier she got word that herman died at the front and things develop between her and the american soldier herman walks in on them in bed and after a confrontation between him and the american maria killed the american herman admits to the murder ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him the country is in shambles one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette there are food shortages it is in short a time of survival of the fittest br br basically this film projects maria's attitudes those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances as a metaphor for germany's loss of soul after they lost the war and how it proceeds to rebuild itself for example maria has the following conversation with a peddler played by fassbinder himself the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that kleist burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold the peddler answers that's another way to look at it right now it's probably the correct way br br maria meets a french german business man karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment she decides to get involve with karl you're not having an affair with me i'm having an affair with you she also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm when karl says i suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle she replies i prefer making miracles Â then wait for them in her own words she has become the mata hari of the economic miracle br br in a lot of fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms see freud in other words he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh t the false social mechanisms the pretending the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology for example she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point i need someone to sleep with as fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society he also remarked that his films are anti emotional br br i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant apparently frequently visited by hitler himself maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side as if maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore karl says i have to tell myself over and over that i love life maria replies that's life isn't it as if we signed a contract to enjoy life and then we go out to eat and talk about food i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone and why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about what love becomes in this society Â a commodity an instrument of power a weapon br br it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war with these clothing essentially the wrong period what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great but fassbinder was not interested in perfection any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled cigarettes it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes peter marthesheimer who wrote most of the script mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park overnight br br hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria mostly she just stares bluntly into the camera in maria's own words it is a bad time for emotions but i like it like that br br there are different opinions about the end after karl died of a hart attack herman finally shows up herman left for australia after he got out of prison to become human again after the testament is delivered made out to her and herman in half maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette and blow her and herman up for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident at the same time she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore she felt as if she had outlived herself
<START> this was the best documentary i've ever seen i just saw lords of dogtown and wanted to know more about stacy peralta and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well great job stacy i was kicking back at work last week bored o less and this movie came on growing up in orange county in the 80's i surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager i grew up at the beach my parents took me every weekend i body surfed boogeyboarded then moved up from there this movie just captivated me it was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through true pioneers this movie is a collectors item
<START> worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone de niro's psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical 90's movie psycho killer the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies one of my most horrible movie experiences rent the original it's 100 times better br br
<START> this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films hero learns that family friends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge foils the ineffective lawman rescues the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been successful otherwise it wouldn't be a formula but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth maturity and realism the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just facades the acting is pitiful sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris lybbert who plays hopalong check out his duds if you dare to watch this film he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working down and dirty cowboy if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy then get this but if you have more than two neurons watch something else
<START> this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen i love the backwoods feel of this movie the movie is very realistic and believable this seems to take place in another era maybe the late 60's or early 70's henry thomas works well with the young baby very moving story and worth a look
<START> spoiler br br i saw this gr8 film a few years back its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get aroused and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love friendship and lovely pairs of jugs hehe br br its brilliant br br dont be put off by sub tit les hehe
<START> to put it simply the fan was a disappointment it felt like as if i was watching taxi driver except taxi driver was much better than this it seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for robert deniro's character 100 percent this approach didn't work
<START> scotty grant cramer who would go on to star in the great b movie killer klowns from outer space agrees to help three middle aged guys learn how to 'dialog' the ladies in this bad '80's comedy not bad as in '80's lingo which meant good bad as in bad with no likable characters including but not limited to a kid who's the freakiest looking guy since friday the 13th part 2 ' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her and the token fat slob because after all what would an '80's sex comedy be without a fat slob well this one has two this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of '80's sex comedies and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel br br my grade d br br eye candy too numerous to count you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point think bachlor party but not as funny and very disturbing br br where i saw it comcast moviepass
<START> this show has a great storyline it's very believable a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show such as rebeecca donaldson the lovable yet strong dog comet nikki and alex who you can find out for yourself i don't want to spoil it for you and of coerce kimmy gibler the sidekick of dj but the kids are wonderful too this is mary kate and ashley first took off and also you may know candace cameron bure from shows like st elsewere punky brewster and that's so raven jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out really this is a very good show
<START> a terrible movie as everyone has said what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott mcnealy giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of sun logos mcnealy is the ceo of sun microsystem a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of microsoft they have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against microsoft so were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire br br there's no public record i see of sun's involvement but clearly the makers of this movie know scott mcnealy an interesting mystery
<START> the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year 2007 two years after it's official release and after many illegal dvd's had found its way to the public apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd's lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watch br br the movie is a great epic bringing japanese culture into your house in an exiting way in a sometimes humorist way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring br br at first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piece br br the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology but that doesn't matter br br the way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the roller coaster of japanese cinema as well as theater br br let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home br br one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well
<START> but i expected better from caroline munro she's done some good films and i was hoping this would be just as good as a matter of fact she and this other blonde girl character the girl who got electrocuted i think were the only two out of the 8 11 actors who could act this film has the worst acting i've ever seen almost as bad as 'psycho' 1998 the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty rigged it to pour battery acid in there she starts screaming and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world she attempts to get out but accidentally falls back in i will admit the violence and story is good along with harry manfredini's music but the acting could've been a lot better there were two other characters frank and joe i don't know about you but they bare a strange resemblance to dan akyroyd also when they find that woman's fried corpse in the bathtub you would think they'd be screaming and barfing no caroline munro and the blonde woman are the only ones who react frank and joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust i don't know about you but i know that if i saw a fried skeleton of one of my best friends i'd puke also when joe starts saying stuff like what happened to marty was an accident it wasn't our fault he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions then the blonde girl starts crying and says i'm scared frank and she grabs joe i guess the actress really didn't know which guy was which the film's ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw more confusing than the climax of jaws the revenge all the eight friends end up dead marty kills them all but then you see something that looks like him being chased by their rotted corpses and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident and then when the film ends marty dresses up as a nurse trying to sedate him but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or somethin like that kills a doctor and the film ends with marty peeling skin off his face which leads me to this next question what was the writer on when he came up with that did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened the ending left me so confused were the characters still alive is marty still holding a grudge did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all i don't know overall this movie was pretty dumb the acting sucked the music was okay the story was pretty decent except for the ending basically this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks see it only for harry manfredini and caroline munro 2 10 br br p s simon scuddamore marty committed suicide shortly after the film's release from intentional drug abuse i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was a pile of sh
<START> look it's eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend it's gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore sex panther cologne in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell he's as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i
<START> a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very good looking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it's tragic and you know she's going to end up very hurt but there's nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants br br the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come br br it's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
<START> american pie has gone a long distance from the first at first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts story sets out as two freshman college guys featuring the young stifler setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties sex and of course the booze the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie in fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film br br luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking i'm a teen myself and i believe even evan almighty would've been a better choice instead
<START> actually this is a lie shrek 3 d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didn't bug's life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so i'm saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure i recommend it to families and kids
<START> where the sidewalk ends 1950 br br where one ends another begins br br this is a prototypical film noir and as such pretty flawless from both style and content points of view the photography and night settings are first rate cinematographer joseph lashelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene and the close ups on faces pure expressionism i can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks br br but the acting is first rate here and the plot features what i consider the core of most noir films the alienated male lead representing the many men returning home to a changed united states after the war and feeling lost themselves in fact not only is dana andrews really convincing as the troubled loner detective he has a small but important counterpart in the film the lead female's first husband an decorated ex gi fallen onto hard times and booze the fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance overall the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head the woman transitions from one to the other we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with it br br this movie belongs to andrews he plays a far more restrained and moving type than kirk douglas plays in a similar role in william wyler's detective story made just one year later and andrews certainly is less theatrical you could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session the fact that andrews as detective dixon is morally struggling through it all and douglas as detective mcleod is not might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesn't gene tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic demurring and ultimately conventional and pretty type of woman not just a cardboard desirable but someone you want dixon to actually marry br br the criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama but is effective enough in its play with types and clichÃ©s the bit parts are kept snappy the small details like the portable craps table nice touches far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in casablanca but then curtiz's great movie is iconic even in the details it makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring they come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men bogart is beginning his active duty dixon and the man dixon has killed are all through through thoroughly but not washed up br br it's no accident that many possibly most film noirs have what you would call happy endings the man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self and the moviegoer then and now understands just how beautiful that must feel
<START> first off i had my doubts just looking at the dvd box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably even as a slasher movie except for the first friday the 13th br br i wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times but i just kept thinking that it had to get a little better it didn't usually i think every movie has something that you can take from it this has nothing br br do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes like give yourself papercuts or eat dirt
<START> this started bad got worse and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the dvd to the person we borrowed it off and choke the c t to death with it avoid this film a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen jenna jameson naked a million times if anyone feels the need to watch this film i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately as an example i would say trying to cram a lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start i hear that this film was not the original version i would very much like to view the original as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot and apparently most of the nudity can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with christian viel he owes me an hour of my life back
<START> overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch with plenty of laugh out loud moments br br but this movie is not for everyone that is why i created this quick question ere if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick br br 1 do you enjoy crude sexual humor 2 do you enjoy alcohol related humor 2 do you enjoy amazingly hot girls 3 do you enjoy viewing boobs 4 do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs 5 did i mention all the nice boobies in this film br br if you noticed the spoiler alert that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie i myself have no idea what the plot was about not that it matters
