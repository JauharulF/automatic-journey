<START> horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie what a waste starting from the name of the movie br br the enemy naming it action movie would've made it better contributing to the parody effect the cop looking like a 60 year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie horrible don't waste your time
<START> this movie is pretty good half a year ago i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film but here they have put the living legend part1 and 2 and fire in space together the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film only the ending is strange you don't see what happens with the pegasus but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you haven't seen it go see it starring richard hatch dirk benedict lorne greene herb jefferson jr tony swartz terry carter lloyd bridges jack stauffer
<START> the melting man a tragic victim of the space race he perished melting never comprehending the race had long gone by br br a man burr debenning burns his hand on the kitchen stove but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream he shouts something that sounds like aaaaatch kah this movie you've popped in isn't a normal movie you've just taken your first step into the incredible melting man the famous late 70's gore film featuring rick baker's wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous cantina aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not br br it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind numbingly awful from the opening credits starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man that's really what it says to the chubby nurse running through a glass door to the fisherman's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer incomprehensibility why did they but how come he why are they after a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is a very entertaining piece of garbage br br an astronaut returns to earth in a melting radioactive condition he escapes and his mind disintegrating as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him wow br br storywise surprisingly little happens during the movie the melting guy wanders around killing people a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter various characters are introduced ask questions and leave eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that he's dr ted nelson the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo the end br br it's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending supposedly a widescreen dvd release is planned a very special movie
<START> i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria so didn't have an idea what i am going to see the story is very normal the movie is very long i believe it could have cut to 1 2 without causing any problems to the story its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ashton kutcher was very good kevin costner is ok the movie is speaking about the us coast guards how they are trained their life style and the problems they face as there aren't much effects in the movie so if you want to watch it then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds
<START> pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series strung together without the usual commercials the story is typical of pokemon conflict fighting and a resolution where all are happy in the end and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation some of the holes in the plot are filled in over the closing credits without explanation and everything is just a bit too sweet br br why see it on the big screen the only reason is to be a part of your child's world both of my sons enjoy pokemon and by my showing an interest in what they like we are closer seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube and my sons enjoy the full movie going experience i gave the movie a 4 mostly from my children's point of view br br
<START> in what will probably find itself on my list of fuller's best movies that is once i see more of them that just this and shock corridor pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale as well as the male protagonist are not the stereotypical ones in the genre like most of his other works fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood noirs on a small budget at least for the likes of darryl f zanuck fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck br br richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who could've really pulled off this character he's a little like bugs bunny as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky on the other hand the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesn't go into other people's affairs and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river after being sent away for three years he slips up unbeknownst to him when he pickpockets a woman peters on the train and lifts an item that's under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film as it involves stoolie moe ritter is one of the finest and most believable character actors from the period the woman's ex a volatile kiley and the police department br br aside from the thematic elements which are told with a keen dramatic journalistic style as was fuller's previous position along with boxer the dialog is fresh and involving there's a spontaneity in many of fuller's camera moves and what a third act this is a lean tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with fuller it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works
<START> so every year there is at least one movie that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success because from the moment of production even before one simple shot is filmed everybody's picking on this movie there is a long list of these kind of movies and in the end some are really bad battlefield earth 2000 some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable catwoman 2004 elektra 2005 and then there are a few which actually are really great for what they are but no one admits i mean my gosh just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on not everybody has to join them so yeaaah maybe those movies aren't perfect but c'mon how many movies are not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings not everybody will enjoy these movies but i bet there are more than who admit they do hudson hawk 1991 who is just hysterical funny color of night 1994 which may not be oscar worthy but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists swept away 2002 which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance gigli 2003 which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former bennifer couple and this year it's basic instinct 2 well when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie and really i was very positively surprised i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here it never simply copies the original it has a quite clever story has tension action humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s but it's more than her being beautiful it's brilliantly acted with all her looks her famous smile the way she speaks and moves from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell and all of the other actors deliver solid performances too so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie it has a dark thrilling sexy and gritty look strong performances and you never felt bored maybe the story isn't oscar caliber but it never even tries to be it's an entertainment movie and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion so give it a try
<START> marlon brando and frank sinatra hated each other while doing this film and in the years following it brando asked sinatra for some singing lessons but sinatra who was already upset over the fact that he was cast as nathan detroit when he wanted the part of skye masterson wanted to be the star singer in the production and didn't want any one to be better than he was he told brando to get lost so to get back at him marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep eating eating and eating in the later years sinatra gave brando the nickname mumbles or mr mumbles because of the way he talks
<START> i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now brokedown palace has that hard to believe' aspect however with the ingenious directing and screenplay Âpalace scores big br br i've really never enjoyed watching claire danes in any of her movies but i'll tell you what she really changed my mind with this one kate beckinsale joins danes on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to hong kong with him however he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him well ultimately they get caught and end up in a thailand prison i know i know how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs well if you can get by that one tiny miscue you will find a very well written and acted out story lately i have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies i watch and developing a personal feeling for the characters that i watch this movie is no different by the end of the movie i found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film br br bill pullman plays hank green an attorney who lives in thailand and specializes in international relations as always pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully br br there are a few twists and turns that will by the end of the movie have you in tears this is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home it is my opinion that the next time out at the video store do not pass by this one again
<START> i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really can't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect i've never been a fan of pj soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that's the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles isn't on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you're a ramones fan
<START> ok i kinda like the idea of this movie i'm in the age demographic and i kinda identify with some of the stories even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi realistic and in a different movie would have been forgivable br br i'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all br br the editing in this movie is terrible possibly the worst editing i've ever seen in a movie there are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn leaning good editing is not one of them but identifying a bad one is br br also the shot oh my god the shots just awful i can't even go into the details but we sometimes just see random things popping up and that in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience br br this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also i've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity joe greta i don't know what the heck you were thinking but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos you should be ashamed of yourselves in conclusion this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene if that's not your kind of thing avoid this at all cost
<START> the more i watch nicholas cage the more i appreciate him as an actor watching this movie now in 2005 i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s i don't really think it can be considered a film noir but it is pretty dark at times due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters br br typical performances from each of the three main actors who all did a good job with their roles i thought however that hopper and boyle's characters were left undeveloped as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy the plot is really good and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic there were parts where i had to hand it to the director i e when he first sees the sheriff all in all this movie is definitely worth watching 1 2
<START> only the glandular secretions and please don't ask for any more details of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist's wife fresh and youthful since like most people except those taking part in medical trials virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly dr lorenz bela lugosi arranges for them to be abducted and preserved he'll do the extracting himself br br what a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie if the corpse vanishes turns out not to be the havarti of horror as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste br br sure the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf angelo rossitto who later played the master in mad max beyond thunderdome his crazed brute of a brother angel frank moran who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair the crazed mother of the two minerva urecal the crazed wife elizabeth russell who sleeps in a plush coffin and of course the crazed doctor lugosi br br an enterprising young reporter patricia hunter luana walters tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims when the doctor and his wife invite pat to stay the night a raging storm immediately breaks out that clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside since it's well known that in hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with they include dark passages a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored a basement mausoleum and later a direct threat to patricia's own glandular secretions if she survives what a story she'll have to give her editor br br if you sample this moist slice of moldy velveeta and why not don't be superior don't judge bela lugosi by the company he keeps here he had a huge impact in dracula 1931 but my favorite movie of his is the black cat 1934 as dr vitas werdegast he's a sad ironic man protective of his two young friends when he finally takes a scalpel to hjalmar poelzig boris karloff and begins to flay the man alive ah well it's a great scene
<START> i'm sick of people whining about ewoks true they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it besides they are cute and i don't care if they're marketable yubb nubb br br this movie always leaves me in tears it's perfect the end could not be better i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin i love how he is revealed at the end it would be too unresolved any other way so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed take a moment to think about it it's very effective vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sick looking man he is not entirely machine he's vulnerable br br i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope they all do so well they are believable characters hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development fisher does a fine job being a female role model i mean come on she killed jabba even when so many others had failed harrison ford need i say more br br the music is once again brilliant it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie the best climax is when luke shouts nooo and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle john williams is nothing short of a genius what an amazing man br br already the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres can i wait and then watch the original trilogy yet again br br bravo
<START> d w griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of 'the birth of a nation' he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date 'intolerance ' he took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form and the well known financial train wreck resulted buster keaton doesn't take that kind of a risk with 'three ages ' a parody of 'intolerance ' this is keaton's first feature length film of his own he only acted in 'the saphead' he had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts which griffith did do with 'intolerance ' keaton didn't have to chaplin had already succeeded with feature length comedies so if keaton was taking a risk here it was completely calculated br br chaplin had already done a parody of another film too with 'burlesque on carmen' 1915 keaton appears to allude to that film as well the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplin's film the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same too furthermore chaplin's film imitated the glossy style of demille's 'carmen ' and chaplin's film seemed a tribute to that film keaton doesn't attempt the radical editing narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody but it seems respectful of 'intolerance' nonetheless at least the stories aren't told completely straightforward as in other post 'intolerance' films such as dreyer's 'leaves from satan's book' blade af satans bog 1921 and fritz lang's 'destiny' der mÃ¼de tod 1921 there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes br br where keaton did take risks however is in his physical daredevil comedy that's keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode reportedly he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again and it wasn't just keaton who took risks the anachronistic baseball gag for example was rather dangerous thus although in a different way keaton like griffith took risks with his big film and i think they both succeeded
<START> for one of the worst swedish movies ever forgive me for being dull br br first of all i haven't seen the first one i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one well i hope the first one is better than this it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes for the people that have seen this and think 4 10 is high belive me so do i but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea what's next det sjunde inseglet ii sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often and this is a perfect example of one br br ok i'm gonna be honest with you i did laugh a bit it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor but don't buy it rent it just let some other idiot do it or download it br br 4 10 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already
<START> out of these pokemon films which are in order of best to least for me pokemon the first movie pokemon 4ever pokemon heroes pokemon 200 and pokemon entei and the unknown this is probably the one most concerning the environment arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one whether these are good points for you or not pokemon 4ever still has entertained many br br as well as the three points covered above this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi as well as anime the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket the comic reliefs rubbish baddies end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks br br the flaws are as always the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting even more so than a few pokemon film baddies br br a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere br br meanwhile ash brock and misty are entering a large forest br br curious watch the rest br br good for all pokemon fans and american anime movie fans enjoy pokemon 4ever
<START> though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what you'd expect from a movie made today though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected dean jagger portrays armand louque an officer in the french army of world war i who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons or zombies who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually french general duval george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it br br the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque duval's daughter claire dorothy stone and clifford grayson robert noland all a part of the expedition when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power that advice begins to transform louque particularly after he's successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city having followed a temple priest into a swamp louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though it's not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control this comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking grayson's early advice as he comments to his servant buna we're learning to be ruthless br br fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosi's signature eye stare plucked from the 1932 film white zombie also from director victor halperin of the two movies white zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in it's depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening in revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor's commands in fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire they overrun his compound and kill him in the process br br not to be too harsh on the film it plays out decently within the parameters of it's story outline but if you're thinking zombies within the traditional context you'll probably be disappointed if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go
<START> take young pretty people put them in an exotic locale stick in a few bad guys have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes create the flimsiest of plots then work out a happy ending for everybody other than the three or four who get murdered of course that's the classic and successful format of the harlequin romance it's not very good but then it's not very bad either like most of the little yellow pocket books and the location stuff in budapest is especially interesting even if they didn't use the wonderful old train station designed by gustave eifel or show the city's famous thermal baths
<START> a repressed housewife an annoying lisping angie dickinson whose body double treats horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch out this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high class prostitute nancy allen clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home 600 a night and her psychologist michael caine if you are going to watch de palma rip off excuse me pay homage to hitchcock watch sisters instead of this dressed to kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the tackiest thrillers i have had the displeasure of sitting through the plot is absurd and tired it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in 1980
