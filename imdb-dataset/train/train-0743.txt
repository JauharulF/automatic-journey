<START> i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie bachelor party starring tom hanks is this movie even an official sequel this movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it br br for a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough it relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments rather then the movie actually features some good original and funny moments br br of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages you just keep waiting for things to finally start off there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non existent i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out br br it's basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity only without the teenage main characters which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless the movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie br br i regret ever watching this br br 3 10
<START> the first noticeable problem about this awkwardly titled film is its casting ann nelson plays the grandma here three years after this she would star in airplane as the woman who hangs herself while listening to robert hays pine for julie hagerty i could not get that image out of my head br br matt boston is a fifteen year old with problems he has headaches his mother had a nervous breakdown his grandfather had a massive heart attack a chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going on with this family first she hypnotizes grandma nelson nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film br br she and grandpa bought an rv cheap and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert california the rv soon has a mind of its own going off the road and such then large boulders begin hurling themselves at it the elderly couple are appropriately afraid but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along br br eventually grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the rv roof when it goes for another unplanned ride br br boston's mom begins talking to some native american mummies she has lying around the house she fancies herself an author and makes copious notes about the musty corpses the psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks we see the mother semi flip out but her mental breakdown occurs offscreen much like gramps' heart attack br br finally the patient de resistance little matt matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale he thinks mom is wigging out this was made in 1977 apparently mom is making the astral bodies of the native american mummies sort of fly through the air one hits matt like a bee hits a windshield and matt begins acting all crazy br br the psychiatrist takes grandma and matt into the desert matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now and the trio confront the unseen and unexplained forces br br flocker has no sense of scene construction the one pro here involves the rv stranded in a salt flat in the desert in the distance the couple notice some boulders rolling toward the rv this is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually overplayed as the boulders begin hurling themselves toward the vehicle the special effects become obvious br br the scenes where the rv runs off the highway then back on again take forever the scenes where grandpa is trapped on the rv roof as it careens down a dirt road takes forever mom's conversations with the mummy take forever matt's out of body experiences take forever this film takes forever br br i was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times as scenes dragged on it was obvious flocker was padding cut the fat here and this would have clocked in at an hour the final explanation that the mummies' spirits were trying to kill those close to matt never holds water did they inhabit the rv the film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways they never kill anybody br br as i kept thinking of nelson in airplane i also thought of other movies anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one boston is terrible as the kid playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart alecky line for all these adults who fall over themselves loving him br br in the end flocker has written and directed a mess the title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease this is not scary and like the ghosts you too can still walk away from this tape at the video store br br this is unrated and contains some physical violence and mild profanity
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper's front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys' boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie's rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie's rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn't a great black and white film well here's another nice mess you've gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian okay
<START> how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time' by the worst director of all time ' a film that could develop a cult following because it's so bad it's good ' br br an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band wagon syndrome let's bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we'd cite br br the film's universal poor quality goes without saying 'sixteen years of alcohol' is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesn't allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements 'sixteen years of alcohol' does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film's poorness that that's a task not worth pursuing br br my impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations 'sixteen years of alcohol' failed to entertain me even on a make fun of the bad movie' level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the 'sixteen years of alcohol' promotional literature i have trouble believing jobson's sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin chuckle moments all i'm sure none intentional spiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad it's good no it had just enough 'i can't believe this is a serious movie moments' to keep me from turning it off and nothing more br br definitely a film to watch with a group of bad movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that would've significantly improved the experience for me so bad it's mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey
<START> before seeing this i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated emmanuelle series starring sylvia kristel it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed what makes 'yellow emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine the beautiful and exotic chai lee she plays her character emy wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her emy wong is a much respected doctor statuesque with a regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her western man but only after a very long courtship as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is a good guy and promises to marry emy so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society neither one counts on a third party one ilona staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been debased the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute classic drama i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally non exploitative and very artsy and soft core if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle with sylvia kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer more sex no more melodrama for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease i actually preferred the cable version better i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don't need sex and violence to maintain their interest
<START> usually i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it but now i was wrong br br the start was great the this is based on a true story and blah blah blah thing was funny after the cartoons and the description of the guys' life with pictures made me think i had made the right choice br br then seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool also the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea br br that was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie which afterwards looked like an eternity br br maybe that's just me not understanding english canadian humour that's possible english canadians also do not always understand quebecois humour but hey there was enough stuff in that for a short movie nothing more maybe that could be a meaning for the title anyway almost everything was filling and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion br br as a matter of fact the making of was better than the movie at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad the potential of the idea was great that's why i rented the movie being interested in the annoying people disappearance thing but yet i did not know the whole universe would vanish and with it even a point to the movie br br if you are english canadian it seems you could appreciate the local humour considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8 otherwise just think twice before losing your precious time
<START> i wasn't really hoping for much when i went to see this after mst3king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience here br br unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about jason's problems i'm sorry no there are a legion ft13th movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day he's an undead serial killer i'm just not going to get that sympathetic br br freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch only not funny br br
<START> you could stage a version of charles dickens' a christmas carol with sock puppets and i'll probably watch it ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories maybe it's the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they're on tv as they inevitably are this time of year br br what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles lines we've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble br br george c scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft portrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man as he is so often portrayed but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately strangled his soul as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human br br impressive as scott's performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty fred holywell scrooge's nephew is an excellent example of this often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you i want nothing from you why can't we be friends we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooge's self imposed separation from his only living relative it is a moving performance and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes br br even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge's late partner jacob marley in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly ooooh look it's a scary ghost not in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie marley's entrance as the locks on scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy but finlay's marley is no ethereal spirit he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity marley may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress are still very human as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when you're opposite george c scott br br and it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like you're experiencing this story for the first time edward woodward remember him from the equalizer is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spanking br br susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs cratchit and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an insufferable boss his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim warner's performance while hardly uttering a word will move you to tears

<START> uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic edward woodward as the ghost of christmas present wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins as scrooge george c scott is too wry and he never seems to truly believe in it which robs his performance of its effect the scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half heartedly flicking through his family album no one else seems to be putting any effort in except frank finlay who chronically overacts
<START> in the questionable comedy vein of mel brooks wholly moses tries to take the bible story of moses and make fun of it resulting in the unfunniest biblical spoof ever filmed br br there is no real plot here just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles dudley moore and laraine newman are on a bus tour of the holy land when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave there they read the story of herschel and zerelda also played by moore and newman herschel's life parallels moses' he was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time moses was herschel's birth father the late james coco becomes herschel's slave after herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor eventually herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer is banished and ends up tending moses' flock of sheep herschel and moses are brothers in law marrying sisters and herschel thinks god has chosen him to free his people in egypt of course moses was receiving the divine word but herschel misunderstood i'll pause here to laugh hysterically pause anyway the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving moore and actors who are making special appearances these scenes do not propel the plot forward they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt br br jack gilford plays a tailor dom deluise has maybe three lines when he meets herschel in the desert john houseman is an archangel just giving the same line readings he gave in the paper chase david l lander is a fake blind man healed by herschel andrea martin is one of zerelda's sisters i was not sure who madeline kahn was supposed to be she gives a ride to herschel and has about a minute and a half of screen time john ritter plays a very unfunny devil richard pryor has one scene as the pharaoh but it was obviously shot at a different time than moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together in the end zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on new sodom's destruction ha ha herschel writes the ten commandments and gives them to moses who is basking in all the glory in the final scenes the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having herschel bait god into an argument god comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading herschel around for his own amusement speaking through him only to give him the ten commandments we even have zerelda quip god works in mysterious ways thereby excusing everyone's very unchristian behavior during the film br br this film is not funny there is nary a laugh to be found anywhere at least monty python made fun of many established religious mainstays in life of brian in addition to their questionable take on jesus' life but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads this makes mel brooks look like merchant ivory churchgoers will be offended not by the film's attitude toward religion but by the smugness the movie exhibits impressed with their own hoitytoityness i know not a word on a subject they obviously know nothing about wholly moses is wholly bad and an embarassment to all involved i suggest you read the book instead br br this is rated pg for some physical violence profanity sexual references and adult situations
<START> that's certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested and it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio given that 1 the feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie's release 2 the feud between the producer robert fryer and director michael sarne was also common knowledge 3 the cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhere br br and 4 the author gore vidal hated it practically from day one nevertheless that tagline just about sums it up raquel welch does br br give a decent performance as myra and she looks lovely besides john huston is very funny as buck loner the ex cowboy star who runs a phony acting academy mae west in her first screen appearance since 1943 naturally rewrote her part to suit herself and she is great as ''oversexed'' and that's putting it mildly ''talent agent'' leticia van allen still she must have wondered after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return how she ever ended up in this mess br br tom selleck in his film debut is one of her ''clients'' john carradine and jim backus as doctors also amble in briefly rex reed as myron farrah fawcett and roger herren as the victims of myra myron's sexual passion are neither here nor there the same goes for the script which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book but seems to head in at least three different directions at once although west's part was originally larger she was reduced to a cameo role by the time sarne was through with the editing and partly because of this she seems to be in a different movie apparently at some point the producers realized that mae was going to be the film's big draw and unable to replace most of her cut footage they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs both of which come out of nowhere the device sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making doesn't work at all by the time the movie concludes all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about not surprisingly just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way and it died at the box office a technically flawless dvd includes among other extras separate commentaries from both welch and sarne each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong no doubt it's home video re release was prompted by a 2001'' vanity fair'' piece which attempted in great detail to do the same thing true the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking but with sarne at the helm of what was obviously a ''troubled'' production it really never had a chance

<START> chang cheh's shaolin temple might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast a veritable who's who of the shaw stable though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in the long gray line cheh's shaolin temple is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style br br the cultural correlation i am tempted to make is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo at the end of the film you too might be tempted to call out remember the shaolin temple
<START> especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed 1973 this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong too many people and nothing works the only people who can live in comfort are the rich it's set in new york in 2022 i think and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta br br i got to appreciate charlton heston's acting after seeing him in orson welles' touch of evil he was maybe is capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi heroic people here he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt taking rare food treats from the rich and being totally corrupt actively condoning evil br br the movie all seems to take place at night and sweat is dripping off everyone except in one of the rare air conditioned apartments even though i hadn't seen it before i knew the famous ending which will not here be revealed but the ending is certainly foreshadowed br br great scenes with edward g robinson going to the council made up of elderly jews with heavy accents so it seems where the truth is revealed and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out br br gritty pre star wars dystopian science fiction
<START> had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in between scenes normal ambient sounds are missing but given it was 1931 and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french films by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely such as in l'atalante from 1934 br br okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like a nice charming film all in all
<START> the incubus is a mix of the good an interesting murder mystery the bad a disconnected script a sloppy resolution badly made attack scenes and the weird strong incestuous overtones a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes was that character really meant to be so wacko not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be but not particularly successful either 1 2
<START> though i've yet to review the movie in about two years i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel br br disney i've got a little message for you if you don't have the original director and actors handy you're just looking to get your butt whooped br br in the sequel our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter melody my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang yes i understand that disney is big on sing and dance numbers but really that's what made eric my favorite prince he was calm collected and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun and he did not sing br br and then there's the villain oh how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world unfortunately that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister morgana nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby oh how cute the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident decides to kidnap a month old baby gag me br br other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her morgana was just very unorthodox the same plan as her sister the same minions who by the way did not scare anyone i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie and she laughed hysterically she had no purpose being in there i'd like to have seen mom be the villain i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there br br king triton held none of the respect he'd earned from me in the first movie and don't even get me started on scuttle sebastian and flounder triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie and in the second it's almost like he's lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects scuttle once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle hopper' yes i'll admit it i did call my fork a dingle hopper from time to time after that in this film scuttle's all but forgotten a supporting character even in the first he at least added something to the movie he was rich with a flavor the others didn't have and in the sequel they all but stripped it from him entirely sebastian was still the same but twice as worrisome as before disney don't do that don't even try to mess with our favorite crab or our favorite little fat fish who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children he's fat and he's bland and he looks like he's going to flat line any second br br the walrus and penguin were unneeded and after a while you just start to resent everyone especially melody who has no depth to her whatsoever br br and one of these days disney i'm kicking out of my life br br if i didn't love your originals so much
