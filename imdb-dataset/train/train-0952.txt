<START> i used to watch this show as a child and i loved it i watched it when it came on toonami years ago sheesh i sound so old i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on but anyways it had a great plot line and i'm one of those girlie girls who watched and adored sailormoon and i enjoyed it very much the animation wasn't the best quite amusing in some parts actually and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning but it was all a good watch and i found myself sucked into it day after day br br samurai troopers ronin warriors is a classic and an all time one of my faves go ryo
<START> absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow annoying thrill less thriller directed by amenabar's usual collaborator mateo gil the film which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills actually delivers none and seems like an exercise in boredom the only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100 plus minutes and is resolved too simply the plot lacks sophistication or credibility and while the idea is original the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference deus ex machina the hero is always passive everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness if you're fans of the genre watch tesis instead
<START> really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i haven't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you don't use a spoiled city brat look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is german br br 2 10 because the photography could be worse
<START> this is the kind of movie i fear the most arrogant and irresponsible it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all colombian people the performances are godawul from grisales her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to bejarano to fanny mickey who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare to dÃ­az who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one dimensional so cliched and so badly written all heÂ´s left to work with is a mustache not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe it fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing jorge alÃ­ triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity i can't say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and responsability from this mean intended fiasco
<START> from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters incorporating character arcs and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the baddies and consequently are shown as shallow incompetent and cowards it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society br br the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence we see him walk through the door of a gaol but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue br br this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression i found the film a real chore to watch it is the direction for modern films and this one put me off watching any more
<START> this movie was so unrelentingly bad i could hardly believe i was watching it the directing editing production and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense big emotional moments and climaxes like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts and character relationships like one hinted at at the very beginning come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film the characters are sadly underdeveloped making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them the acting surprisingly is not entirely bad but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances the film plays like a particularly bad t v western epic and sadly diminishes the fascinating true story that it attempts to tell i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter that's all very well but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn't make the movie good no one is saying that the subject matter isn't good just the quality of the movie itself pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans but that doesn't mean i'm going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad a failure all around though heath and orlando are lovely to look at
<START> tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it br br mary gives her typical spunky innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong side of tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir only this time the stakes are higher a false murder charge an illegitimate child and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood and contemplated suicide br br one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one the story is a real morality tale the kind that she loved to star in the controversial topics aren't always spelled out plainly a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing Â although everything is more or less explained in the end br br about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean hersholt and the dog hersholt whose character ben letts looks to be about 6 2 200 pounds bigger next to mary of course is sent fleeing in panic when a 60 pound chocolate lab charges toward him then to top it off or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later as a bad storm hits this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with frederick lloyd hughes and cuddles with mary yet mary later throws boiling water in ben's face which barely slows him ok i've vented about ben and the chocolate lab other than that the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention pickford's supporting cast was strong and believable this is certainly among her better films
<START> this movie is so bad it's funny it stars scott backula as some coach but that's not important what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base first off he has to be at least 75 years old yet still plays minor league baseball second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk let alone run coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film spoiler he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run clearly downtown viewed this as a good move he hit the home run and won the game for his team a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie now if only tony muser manager of the royals would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game
<START> la sanguisuga conduce la danza or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is it's common english title is set on 'ireland' in '1902' where the mysterious count richard marnack giacomo rossi stuart invites soon to be out of work theatre actress evelyn patrizia webley as patrizia de rossi three more of her fellow soon to be out of work actress friends cora krista nell penny lidia olizzi rosalind marzia damon as caterina chiani to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel leo valeriano goes along as well once there count marnack tells his guests that his father grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife there's a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current count's wife who ran away not too long ago along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off br br this italian production was written directed by alfredo rizzo is total complete utter crap from start to finish first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever no one 'leads' anything at anytime there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things what you should expect though is a tedious dull boring pointless little 'giallo' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less uninteresting as anything out there the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft core porn film you've ever seen then cut most of the soft core porn out that just leaves bad actors bad dubbing bad dialogue a tiny bit of soft core sex lesbianism absolutely nothing else yep it really is that bad the mystery elements are crap people do illogical things for no apparent reason the overly complicated 'twist' ending is as bad as the rest of it the sixth sense 1999 this ain't br br director rozzi does an ok job la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look feel to it despite it's obvious low budget i mean there are scenes where he shows a 'storm' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black white so the film jumps from bright colour to black white whenever it cuts to the storm back to colour again there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid her friend discuss her breasts she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments this scene is so funny just so unnatural that it's priceless easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue there is minimal nudity the sex lesbian scenes are very tame forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head br br technically the films pretty good the period setting production design are actually quite impressive although it's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough the film has a nice sense of colour the cinematography is fine the film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible the dialogue is even worse than usual br br la sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film it makes no sense it has virtually no story for over an hour it has possibly the most misleading title ever is really dull boring with a confused stupid 'twist' ending as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid trivia note the notorious banned in the uk nazi exploitation horror film horrifying experiments of the s s last days 1977 aka ss hell camp the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza
<START> beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum that there might be a connection between the present day asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned br br at the same time there's an effort to present edward burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the film's spoken message remains unclear br br i don't mean to imply that there aren't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize manufactured landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness it's like a two hour lecture by noam chomsky maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the american and canadian left
<START> pet sematary though a nice 80's horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati it's clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie zeder was made before king wrote the book br br the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being stephen kind a famous american writer it's totally normal that he can get away with this it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no budget and in part it's crap itself but the original idea i repeat it it's italian director avati br br let the world know
<START> kalifornia is a good hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross country to california to share the cost of gas a pair of losers lewis pitt and two wannabee artists a photographer and a writer duchovny forbes pitt nails his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller a good watch for those into psycho killer flix
<START> this film should have never been made honestly i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts the director is not a great actress though she did a lot of movies in holland and the young woman who took the main part is a tv personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self criticism the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better he did not convince me than to start with the the story i have not read the novel it is based upon but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues it was most of the time spoken out loud my regards go to the cameraman at least he tried to make something out of it it is a pity that the film is edited lousy if not some scenes were certainly more credible
<START> i was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover alas it is easily one of the worst movies ever made judging by the acting of the film characters it's more a comedy than a horror film no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb avoid it
<START> any film in the early days of orson welles is a triumph all the way to the third man with joseph cotton he is also wonderful in a touch of evil please see them all he tends to get pompous and self serving in films like f is for fake really stupid waste of film don't waste your time watching it it is really ignorant orson welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed all his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end welles became a fat drunk like his character in a touch of evil for some reason orson welles had a way with women i see how he could be considered attractive in his youth not like gary cooper or joseph cotton or cary grant john wayne i could go on and on but i digress and because i am a woman i can see the attraction to him he orson welles is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film makers of today tarantino scorscese spike lee most of the film makers just don't measure up to the film makers of the forties i know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time i can't name them all no offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium august 21 2006 please remind me of some current up and coming film makers i don't want to be stuck in the past i love some of the films out now but rarely are there any that i would put on a 100 best list hustle and flow was great so was fargo and oh brother where art thou from a line in sullivan's travels another fine film from the forties can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006 i would like to know who to watch thank you also props to this website where else can you plug a film or boo it i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasn't seen it yet
<START> this hodge podge adapted from a gore vidal novel actually one of the great american writers makes the magic christian and valley of the dolls look like fellini art works raquel welch with an incredible body and she's actually not very tall in a lead role except for kansas city bomber when she was quite good playing rex reed's bad movie reviewer not critic alter ego only to be surrounded by drag queen great chick mae west horny john huston a young and naive farrah fawcett pre lee majors what a shame and other various creep azoids to pretend to spoof way too may things has nothing going for it except inter spliced old films clips i e widmark in kiss of death lena horne just so they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone br br a 2 out of 10 best performance it's so bad it's worth seeing
<START> hard to categorize the film perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good vonnegut novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that everyman persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peaks with little air time isn't the choicest of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given today's geopolitical realities the novel's premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography history and lord knows what other subjects
<START> i was about 11 years old i found out i live 0 48 miles from the uncle house the uncle house is on westway dr deer park tx they have added homes since the movie was made i don't know the house number but you can go look it up i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie the bar on spencer is no longer their pasadena isd wants to build a school their i drove by the house last week the house still looks great my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time
<START> animal farm 1954 was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism how good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head sadly this movie does not portray either of these what we're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing the animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of george orwell's novel is sorely missing br br if you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch i just found this one to be somewhat mediocre just one man's opinion however br br the remake is a notch below but not by much
<START> scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company br br shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows they've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original br br i'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows br br and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but it's not real scooby doo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might too br br it's worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes we'll see how it looks after two more episodes by then i'll have formed a much more solid opinion
