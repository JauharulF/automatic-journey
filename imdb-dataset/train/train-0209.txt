<START> as essential a part of british pop culture as the monty python and james bond doctor who was a massive hit for 26 years 1963 1989 making it one of the longest running tv shows in the world most serials are lucky to have ten seasons plans to reboot the series were always on the bbc's agenda and after a miscalculated not to mention americanized tv movie produced by fox failed to capture the magic of the original version another nine years comic relief spoof and animated mini series notwithstanding were required before the ultimate time lord could return properly courtesy of acclaimed writer russell t davies br br davies' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider rose tyler billie piper a london based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic she is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the doctor christopher eccleston and then disappears after quipping nice to meet you rose run for your life as she gets more and more curious about this man she soon finds herself in a whole new world aliens invasions travel through time and space and of course the omnipresent police box shaped tardis br br the first 45 minutes of the new doctor who are almost perfect the special effects could have used a bit more polishing because davies nails two things the show's unique humor and the two protagonists the original series' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci fi and pure british comedy a hybrid that's hard if not impossible to export here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between rose and the doctor who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode okay so technically eccleston's doctor is the ninth to use that name but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a northern accent the one he uses on a daily basis and justifying it with a terrific line lots of planets have a north br br the real triumph of this episode though is piper's performance in theory rose is in her late teens therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the doctor before her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new exciting universe represents the new generation's reaction to the return of a tv icon and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and eccleston is a sign indicating the new doctor who is just as good as the old one br br first fifth ninth it makes no difference there may have been others before eccleston and piper for that matter but together he william hartnell peter davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character one so cool he doesn't even need a name he's the doctor

<START> ok so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually don't like british films remade by americans so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps the film was appalling the bit at the beginning with the crash fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated the history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored and i guess being set in america didn't really help the whole pagan theme this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense i must say that the best bit was right at the end when nicolas cage goes up in flames i am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to cleanse my disappointed soul i really can't stress how disappointing this film is please don't see it if you br br a don't like american re makes of british films b are a fan of the original c hate nicolas cage
<START> i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire ice on an old oop rental videotape br br well for one thing this is better than any other conan esque film you'll ever see sure it's cheesy but who cares it stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr fotr though i love that film br br the plot goes like this after a battle between fire ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols ice subhuman creatures while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her br br yeah it doesn't sound as a original as nurse betty but that's not the point it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies fire ice and it succeeds br br as for the action scenes superb they are well handled have terrific suspence and have plenty of loud noises just check out the climatic battle now that's an ending br br the acting and dialogue competent really they aren't gonna be nominated for an oscar but they are ok and don't get on your nerves br br the animation is quite good shot on 3d and rotoscoped i think it looks pretty good a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn and although the character designs feel a little 1 dimentional they are ok br br overall this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical entertainment 10 10
<START> story of a good for nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music director danny boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost in this film the edge for creating inspiring and funny films strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv

<START> judging by some of the comments in imdb i was expecting an action movie perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one but essentially an action movie br br whatever it is that i watched it certainly didn't feel like a movie the story is simple and straightforward even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated take three interest groups 1 the government 2 the rebels 3 a group of assassins br br now subtract the first they never appear in the movie then simply let one of the assassins the princess become a rogue on a revenge trip add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience and you've got the ingredients br br but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci fi on a low budget what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness the movie just does not feel like a movie but a weird incoherent boring dream br br avoid br br 2 10
<START> odd slasher movie from producer charles band in the days of full moon's greatest success band said that he would never make real killer films because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better people killing each other is thus real and less fun a nice philosophy and a true shame that band having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality the team behind this one also worked on 'delta delta die ' and 'birth rite' both equally bland by full moon standards debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a 'murder club' she as one would obviously does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not the choice is there's and with regard to this movie its yours not recommended but not entirely bad either
<START> to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue that is not what this film is br br what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church although this could be substituted for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film br br it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching 'if we do not study the past we are bound to repeat it'
<START> didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the no expectation factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated br br the setting was interesting strange but interesting the storyline had gaps jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit there's no great soundtrack playing in the background creating the romantic ambiance but they all didn't matter br br the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist i fell in love with it and here i am writing this review the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb and i believe that is the core of this movie br br this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy in fact not all of us will appreciate it i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first i cannot guarantee everyone will like it but i hope you do
<START> hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla it works perfectly caine his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to persuade his team to help him the procedure works well caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails he remain invisible the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again he's invisible right he can do anything he wants br br directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know it's just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late night early morning cable tv worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci fi action provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes i thought the character's were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself then of course there's the gore he shows a rat being torn apart that's just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty sadistic tone about it having said that i love horror gore exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea br br director verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular more or less flawless their brilliant it's as simple straight forward as that there's some good horror action set pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over the top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results br br with a staggering budget of about 95 000 000 hollow man is technically faultless i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy br br hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch
<START> i too have gone thru very painful personal loss twice and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well life out of balance nothing makes sense well meaning relatives etc br br it was nice to see ally again she is one of my all time favorite movie actors br br i laughed and cried as the story unfolded great story and cast well done
<START> here's a horror version of priscilla queen of the desert they wish starring melinda mindy return of the living dead 3 clarke as candy a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend johnny jason durr he ends up in a south of the border prison run by the sadistic chief screw an overacting robert englund in a toupee she and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor the dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen bitches and candy develops a very long talking killing forked tongue she can't control thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications br br first off clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie you watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes very convincing during the horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and disguises including an eye popping skin tight latex bodysuit and wonder how come this actress isn't a huge star it's too bad the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to her promise br br blame director scripter sciamma who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs but his vulgar gags annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor another nail in the coffin the film looks cheap lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales luckily for sciamma that clarke is in his film because she alone keeps you watching
<START> this is possibly the best short crime drama i've ever seen the acting is superb especially amanda burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some she does an amazing job balancing rachels carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv film the ending which i'm not going to give away is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one you'll get what i mean after you've seen it this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person
<START> this movie is one of the best ever produced by disney br br the plot is very original and entertaining the animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors for the time br br perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor
<START> according to this board i guess either you love it or hate it usually how it goes with all movies there is no need to get testy with others though all we are doing here is giving opinions i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix i was surprised by how many people are thrashing it though there's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan i'm a horror movie fan most plain olÃ©' movie fans don't like horror movies so many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days it's hard to keep up and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are i wanted to come and write a review about hood of the living dead because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there it's nothing special but it's those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film i really liked this one you telling me there is no effort in this one and one more thing i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collections that you are so proud of nothing but major motion pictures right nothing wrong with that but you have to know how to appreciate low budget independent i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie i'm not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix and if most of you are under 24 that explains everything good movie folks check it out
<START> the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot so the basic idea is the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously what is wrong with these guys they're talking like they were armed with rolled up newspapers okay i admit it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire even when the situation is so much to your advantage but don't go nuts and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway i'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot they're like ten ft away they hit absolutely nothing then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism and then yeah there you have it one of the cops actually hits someone bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something i had a good laugh i guess
<START> in my opinion this is the best stand up show i have ever seen i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill but i must say i think this is his best work i would say though if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live it is worth it br br most of the time after seeing a stand up routine a couple times the jokes start to get old but i have to say i've seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing memorized which yes i realize is kinda sad but every joke still makes me laugh this is truly a feel good show br br dress to kill will never get old for me i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh
<START> i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it however after a few days i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind my appreciation of this movie increases it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable br br as many have commented the movie is non linear and that's a hallmark of european film making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors i don't really know whether it's true or not many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations to those viewers i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions however for others who have yet to see the film do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise br br the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods it is also not as confusing as suggested just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end br br yes lots of things are left unsaid or not shown and lots of situations are left unexplored but isn't that what life is like a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends loved ones unless you confront them and even then you can never be 100 sure if they told you the whole truth this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions the movie does however leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions for example mathieu is manic depressive to the point of suicidal why i don't know maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric rearranging and indeed shattering his life to be with him he realizes that it is all coming undone i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off mentality fragile by that scene w the dead bird maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w the stray cat also there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt the doctor asks him if everything is okay and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once but that's nothing according to cedric is that the only reason we don't know there are probably others all mixed up together is it paramount that we know exactly what they are i don't think so for this movie another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene mathieu is interested in studying the ruins cedric is not he is the one w the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs br br finally the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end br br i have two complaints for the dvd one is the sound it's very soft i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene it became too loud the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off they stay on the screen most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately
<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is i think a story of a rebellious college basketball player his tough but fair coach his girlfriend and a fellow student played by michael margotta who has continual nervous breakdowns the story goes nowhere there is zero character development there is nobody to care about and the performances with the exception of bruce dern as the coach are terrible it is hard to believe how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie make sure to avoid this turkey
