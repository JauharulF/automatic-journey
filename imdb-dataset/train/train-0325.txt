<START> spoiler warning there are some minor spoilers in this review don't read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film br br the disney channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel most of these are mediocre and drab having a few good elements but still being a disappointment phantom of the megaplex ' stepsister from planet weird ' zenon girl of the 21st century' every once in a great while they make something really really great genius ' the other me' but once in a while the disney channel makes a huge mistake and gives us a real stinker this month december 2000 the disney channel featured the ultimate christmas present ' which i thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting apparently the brainiacs com' was rushed out a few days before christmas to get a jump on the holiday because the plot has to do with toys they even paid for a feature in the tv guide so i thought it must be better than the norm i was in for a complete shock only disney's model behaviour' has been worse than this br br the plot was more far fetched than normal i usually let that slide but here it just goes too far matthew tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work his father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat time and time again his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home he gets a hair brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing that whole concept is full of fallacies when kids send in millions of dollars matthew opens his own company's bank account and buys up most of his dad's business's stock he is the secret boss but he doesn't reveal this to his dad but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer that image itself is so complex and ridiculous that it isn't possible for someone to create it at home much less someone who comes across as stupid as matthew to make a long plot short matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids but a federal agent shows up inquiring about matthew's company as it is fraudulent br br there's so much wrong here as mentioned the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses which these kids are not the website the cartoon image the computer chip even the stuff they are being taught in school are far too advanced for these kids the acting by most of the cast especially kevin kilner is terrible some familiar faces are wasted dom deluise plays the evil bank owner but his part is a throwaway he has one good scene with alexandra paul who shows she has the ability to act in which he explains his motives but nothing more and rich little is wasted in a small role as a judge there's even some offensive and uncalled for anti russian jokes but the greatest atrocities are the hard hammered themes these themes show up in many of the disney channel's films but never before have these ultra conservative messages been pounded so strongly the typical overworking parent' idea is really pushed hard and after delivering it inappropriately in the ultimate christmas present ' seeing it again sours my mood family relations are important but disney must stop this endless preaching because working is important to maintaining a workable family too except for cancelling activities thanks to work the father didn't come across as that bad but i found it offensive when the grandmother told him i don't like what i see ' just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents must marry if they want to raise their kids right enter alexandra paul whose character while important to the plot is there solely to be the love interest for the father this offensiveness only proves that the disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the disney script barrel instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud wait for the next disney channel movie it has to be better than this zantara's score 1 out of 10
<START> perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film ie tackiness farce wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes genres pakeezah is indigenous to the sub continent and authentic almost madam butterfly like in plot characters are well developed direction although sometimes unrefined by today's standards perceptive and convincing the urdu speaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age the acting particularly the 'looks' and the dynamic between characters are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim india br br coupled with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance kathak as is the case with most romantic tragedies the heroine must die but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled
<START> i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at guess i was lied to this movie is very boring br br the movie starts out kip raines giovanni ribisi sitting outside a porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car when they confirm it's the right one kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window shattering it he gets the porsche while his friend gets the keys they start up the car and take off into the night they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police so the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways then we get a glimpse of memphis raines he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go kart track then he is confronted by atlee jackson will patton atlee tells memphis that his brother kip is in deep bleep memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles memphis heads to a junkyard and meets raymond calitri christopher ecclesten this guy threatens to kill kip if memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours br br there are a few problems with this film br br 1 story the first 48 in movie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out the last 12 in movie hours are a waste br br 2 the cars you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises so where are the other 40 cars why don't we get to see them br br 3 the chase the chase at the end of the movie was a joke it was not suspenseful at all br br 4 the dog somewhere in the movie the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well this is impossible the keys were flipped open the keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus stomach and large intestines the guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out this won't work the dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum take laxatives lots of diarrhea but no car same case with the dog br br 5 the cop during the chase when eleanor breaks down for a few minutes nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car you see a police cruiser behind him who isn't looking at his car at all but right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again the police officer jerks his head to the right sees the car and immediately begins to chase after him it is stupid so right when he heard the engine start and saw the car he knew that was the car he was looking for how does he know it's the right car he only sees the back of it br br overall the movie is boring there is no action there are very few cars the movie is stupid i have never seen the original but i plan to br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 get the fast and furious instead
<START> i almost burst into tears watching this movie not from laughing but from the memories of a great rodney dangerfield movie candyshack was his first and stole the movie easy money had him at his best and back to school is by far an 80's classic masterpiece then there was ladybugs and that's when it started to show poor rodney was getting old meet wally sparks was a slight step up from ladybugs but not saying much br br in my 5 wives rodney plays monte a name he must love since that was his name in easy money a rich isnt he always guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the amish he inherits 5 wives this sounds like a great idea for a dangerfield movie the problem is everything the script is so poor that rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not rodney andrew dice clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the f word which he should since the film is rated r but plays as if it was pg and jerry stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo don't get me wrong at times i did laugh at a few of rodney's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow we can see his jokes coming from miles and the film turns way too pc which thanks to the horrible 1990's the 70's and 80's rodney just doesn't work anymore
<START> when i saw this trailer on tv i was surprised in may of 2008 i was at six flags in new jersey and this was showing at a 4 d attraction you know the attraction that the seats move i take it that the version i saw was a shortened version 15 min and also re created to add the motion effects it was a cute movie but that was it it was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a cgi spacewalk seemed a bit well trite i was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk i will say the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute so all in all i would say if you want to bring the younger kids go for it but if you are wanting to take your older kids take them to another movie they will thank you
<START> the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense what a waste of 2 perfectly good hours if you can explain it to me please do i don't usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either i'm slower than i think or this was a really bad movie
<START> br br attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs the very meager story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly basically they spin and growl yes they growl and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup the actors are no names who never made movies after this so there would be no point to name them there's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives anyway there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government if this isn't making much sense to you you understand this movie never would have been very good in the first place but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes the movie is horribly cheezy which although being the whole point really really hurts what could've been a reasonably entertaining movie at one point a giant wax tomato slides on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value but even this is lacking from this terrible movie 2 10
<START> paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up br br tony shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist phd who cannot find decent work in america he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab br br the chief doctor is a bitter man as paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn embarasses the doctor who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building where mikail tony s finds him br br paulie recants his life with marie and how they lost each other the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie only more than 20 years has passed br br the movie ends some will say predictably with mikail reuniting paulie with marie the story closes with the three entering marie's home where you can make the final your own choice br br great family film
<START> this is a well made documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing the photography is simply outstanding the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car is incredible the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film
<START> this is the weakest of the series not much of a plot and a rather odd looking wallace but it's still pretty good considering a sign of greater things to come br br 6 10
<START> this is what happens when you're living in china and the local video store is running thin on english language titlesÂyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be yes romanian cinema nevertheless i think that it has real comedic potential br br spoilers technically follow br br though i don't think that it would in fact spoil anyone's viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery even in flashback that mystery and many other conundrums remain to be exploited by desperate comedians perhaps when they're stuck in bucharest br br let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this it's sad
<START> the filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories so filming of the israeli side dominated i was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers the israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness the palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair with such completely different viewpoints any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds the word peace did not have the same meaning to each of them peace to the palestinian was freedom peace to the israeli was security with such an abyss is this sort of film really worth much i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda both sides were unconvincing
<START> this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work well together this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a marvelous little comedy drama
<START> he only gets third billing behind arthur treacher virginia field but this was effectively david niven's first starring role and he's charmingly silly as p g wodehouse's dunderheaded bertie wooster master in name only to jeeves that most unflappable of valets as an adaptation it's more like a watered down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing and that's too bad since the interplay between treacher niven isn't too far off the mark alas the 'b' movie mystery tropes forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes next year's follow up step lively jeeves was even more off the mark with no bertie in sight and jeeves of all people forced to play the goof
<START> a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword i've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don't think i can ever watch a another movie again may god pity the souls who made this br br premise ex army quiet stud underwear model type character well acted actually goes looking for the girl who sent him a xmas card while serving in the military lands in with her cabin living granola type family who are right wing loggers family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see he's a better catch than her liberal looking french wine drinking porsche driving loud cell phone talking lazy city slicking jewish looking fiancÃ© br br the bad 1d characters 1d themes being beat over the head with the pro military theme ed asner br br the good commercial breaks were long peter jason it ended

<START> i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack so here goes br br atrocious i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time it's really really painful but it was next on the list you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is hobgoblins but it just couldn't get out everything about this movie is 4th rate the story the acting the effects the women the action scenes the ahhhh forget it i can watch a piece of crap like the bloodwaters of dr z aka zaat over and over and over with hardly any ill effects i like it in fact btw it will be on tcm later this month october 2009 but hobgoblins is a whole 'nother ballgame br br the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended i had a good night's sleep some coffee and some dry toast my medications and yet the ersatz new wave dance music that amy red shorts and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head this torment will last for days br br good luck won't you
<START> i have nothing against a fast paced fright flick but this stephen king derived nonsense is too freshly scrubbed too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a sleepwalker sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf and who feeds on the blood of female virgins begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy's mother kridge from ghost story never broke out of the filler female mold and it's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that sleepwalkers might've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction it's too over the top and commercially driven with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do real life directors john landis and tobe hooper 1 2 from
<START> illudere to delude comes from latin verb 'ludere' to play so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history whatever it may be and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty the raw material of any relationship from the personal to the social after many years ago i was able to finish the book it was a revelation at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing i really started to love le carre after that novel the main character is not wavering at all he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love or is he not after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama' there is no game left there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way or both there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service' or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels the actors are excellent as are the locations and sets of course the script here is brilliantly adapted be warned though even if someone may find it laughable the after taste is bitter
<START> thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever seen br br i can't even think of a close second and i've seen some really bad movies br br absolutely nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i've seen better on youtube here's some typical dialogue br br steve steve steve is that you steve i'm not kidding steve this isn't funny steve are you there steve steve steve br br arggh ahhhhhh nooooooo
