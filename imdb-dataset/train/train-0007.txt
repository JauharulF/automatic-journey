<START> this is a wonderful movie with a fun clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under appreciated movie don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy great movie all around
<START> the only thing that an inconvenient truth proves is that al gore is still an idiot these unchallenged experts are unchallenged because a response to their inane hypotheses is generally beneath real science this is mostly false science folks the greatest source of greenhouse gases co2 is people we exhale it and unless you're willing to start sacrificing your brethren to save the world there's not a darn thing to be done we've heard how the world was going to end as the result of man for more than 50 years fools publish a time line for their doomsday and when the time passes nothing has happened an inconvenient truth is just another vehicle with which a disingenuous faction of american society can peddle their poop br br and as to al leaving the tobacco business because of his sister's death from cancer that is a load too al couldn't run his farm any better than he could run the country he was losing money on the operation because he didn't care to farm when he could make more on speaking tours the only global warming that is unchallenged is the hot air produced by this gasbag
<START> while i would say i enjoy the show i expected something completely different from when i first saw 'what i like about you' i expected to find something along the lines of 'all that' i am not sure if it is going on anymore but i have to say i do like the show and while i don't classify it as a breakthrough show it is very charming and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well including the supporting cast br br i would definitely say that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen because i really loved him in city guy i had also seen the woman who plays valerie's friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show i do not really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
<START> i myself am a kid at heart meaning i love watching cartoons still do i remember watching bugs bunny when i was a kid he was my favourite still is i thought man this was a great new show on tv and than my dad said bugs bunny i remember watching him when i was younger and i'm like dad bugs didn't exist when you were younger so i guess he's definitely pleased more than one generation possibly 3 i love the show it's great for kids and adults ok everybody it's very funny me and my husband both in our 20s love watching the shows and we don't mind the re runs either this show brings back a lot of memories happy ones i love the christmas special too with tweety as tiny tim it's cute i can't pick my favourite looney toons character because they've changed over the years when i was little it was bugs of course and porky pig pepe is cool i always loved him actually i have to say there all my favourite i'm giving this show a 10 out of 10 because it's a great show for all ages very funny voice acting is incredible the only flaw is that unfortunately it came to an end 2 decades ago but the re runs are great
<START> writer director co star adam jones is headed for great things that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film cross eyed rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did cleverly written and masterfully directed cross eyed keeps you involved from beginning to end adam jones may not be a well known name yet but he will be if this movie had one or two named actors it would be a box office sensation i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie regardless of where it ends up if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed
<START> this movie is simply wonderful it's got it all laughter sorrow beauty poetry truth all in a simple yet intense story like life you won't get distracted for a second br br 10 10 br br p s somebody tell hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie and there are so many good stories out there
<START> when i heard that the dukes of hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script i was like alright i'll give it a chance it's not going to be better than the first but we'll see what happens well i saw what happened i saw a great late 70's 80's show that was a classic basically humiliated by hollywood it's so sad to see that hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days they are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience and try to remake the classic show heads up hollywood it ain't workin anyway more about the show i think they could have casted a better actor than sean william scott stiffler from american pie to play bo i'm sure that john schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of also get for real johnny knoxville as luke duke how low can you go a crappy jackass actor to play lovable luke this sickens me also i'll give jessica simpson is a beautiful woman but her acting sucks catherine bach who played the original daisy was smart sexy strong opinionated and a good il' southern girl she was every little girls role model growing up i owned the doll and the jeep thank you very much anyway jessica simpson played a smart ass 2 bit slut as daisy duke daisy never was blonde why did they have to cast her jessica alba would have played a great daisy duke she can speak with a great southern accent and she is gorgeous and would have done a wonderful job anyway i'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce i feel like i got ripped off by paying 8 50 for tickets and they should refund my money if you like the dukes of hazzard the original series don't see this movie it'll just upset you cmt country music television plays the reruns of the dukes all the time later at night so set your tivo's and go with the real thing not the imitation on the big screen in hollywood
<START> apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties eugene pallette as the gruff police detective jack la rue as the swarthy italian and of course james lee as the chinese cook this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room for an early 1930's film this step by step peeling of the veneer of the mystery is similar to the columbo series except in this film you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance
<START> the film gets my stamp of approval the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film dickinson's character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film the best work angie dickinson did since point blank
<START> contrary to most reviews i've read i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies spinal tap etc the story was more unique although i feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding to br br as an american i knew a few of the actors spall connelly rea surprised to find out brian bruce robinson was in zifferedi's sp classic romeo juliet guess i'll have to rent that next br br the flame still burns my wife who hails from mexico didn't follow the english british language too well missed some of the jokes which i dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene she loves the song so much now br br funny that amazon com has the soundtrack for 30 usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal mart for 5 50usd price non withstanding i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since
<START> and this is a very disturbing film i may be wrong but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor who transformed the role and delivered a message br br jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent they are unassuming and unaware businessmen wanting to enjoy the country little did they know what would happen next br br the photography and sets are realistic and natural this was before the days of wes craven br br what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist in america country folk still detest city people it is almost a century and a half since the civil war br br you will enjoy this film it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia which still exist just don't drive past that to mobile alabama that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina 10 10
<START> its not braveheart thankfully but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week find it has held up well over time not a classic film but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment
<START> watching it now it's still as skanky and sexist as i remember comes from a time when girls were dolly birds and basically men's playthings it's hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact it's available on dvd when good films are not our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy blue saucy nightie or something similar like shirley bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972 warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus which i've been informed is not a routemaster but a bristol br br look just don't bother watch something decent instead like porridge or dad's army or a fly crawling up a wall
<START> i really looked forward to this program for two reasons i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters i don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960's it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust br br in short no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight and the bell 222 the actor that portrayed airwolf wasn't very fast even by helicopter standards and it didn't stay in production very long br br there was a movie that came out during this time period called blue thunder that was much more realistic
<START> in order to stop her homosexual friend albert perry king from being deported back to belgium stella meg foster decides to marry him the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party they fall into bed and then into love later in the film after falling in love stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing what she finds will leave the viewer stunned this is a great film very original perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here very controversial upon its release in 1978 the r rated film is now pg in this much more liberal time br br recently released on dvd the disc contains a making of segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved
<START> this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo br br i was impressed right from the start don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut like me this could be happening on earth the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting there are no space ships or laser guns none yet anyway so far i've seen up to s01 e04 and i'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities br br the cast play there roles with pasion eric stoltz is especially strong br br this show really stands alone well it doesn't matter if you watched bsg or not in fact they are quite different i've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them br br this is a really positive start to a show lets hope they don't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days
<START> what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no self respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda bynes' talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid airhead desperate men chasing old maid wannabes is beyond me br br their plots and dialog remind me of the simpons homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen everyone should ask where's poochie all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the 2 women are either shallow stupid or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks
<START> watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again even when you thought that mackerel surely can't be coming around again slap there it was i'm not sure what they were thinking this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well and while blazing saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive there was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do
<START> as gently as i can i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time i did not find it the 'warm emotionally satisfying' film others did i found it boring with music that distracted from the film the story was thin the characters overdrawn and the direction pedestrian br br fooey br br now i'm going to write some more about this movie so i make the 10 line minimum there really isn't more to be said and brevity is important but imdb has its minimums so here goes br br young eager kid finds nascent talent seeks time with aging embittered mentor in spite of father's cartoonish homophobia aging embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little conflict arises while i don't think this is a spoiler i've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much br br mostly i just found the film boring and pretentious a waste of my time i honestly don't understand what little fuss there seems to be mostly on this web site about the transcendent quality of this movie i think it's really worth avoiding but as dennis miller used to say maybe i'm wrong
<START> a rating of 1 does not begin to express how dull depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is
