<START> to be as honest as i possibly can the devil's plaything or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters orÂÂ is a complete bore the movie has a good premise behind it Â the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black Â but the execution is horrible there are great long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens characters just stand around with nothing to do there's no mystery no suspense and no plot points to care about the acting is simply abysmal most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera they do this repeatedly and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing while it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead it comes close
<START> creep is the story of kate potente an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station after somehow meeting workmate and would be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city's streets her story is linked to that of george blackwood an ex con working in the sewer system they meet in the final third of the film brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them br br the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery most tube stations don't have toilets so how one has a surgery is beyond me naturally the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn't have running water yet it has electricity just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create br br the monster itself is a problem there's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions it just kills people for no obvious reason and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son and a few shots of some jars containing babies and yes it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak communicating only in raptor screams but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay hmm br br this doctor business leads to scene that is the film's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch it just isn't enough the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason george breaks down unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard yeah br br after starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid
<START> the story of a woman from nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful woman saki ryoko yonekura on a harley and the location is in a town somewhere in japan br br in this actioner there's a considerable amount of gunplay some of it good some predictable and other spots somewhat hokey but it's a whole lot of fun ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due it wasn't much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge but she handled things very well she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama musashi br br i'd highly recommend film if you're a ryoko yonekura fan which i adoringly am and or a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings to me there's something eminently and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like la femme nikita and the long kiss goodnight and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake
<START> witty and disgusting brash and intelligent baseketball redefines comedy sports with a pot spoof of an easy target makes other so called comedies like dead boring one of the best of all time trey parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection
<START> i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character's don't seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire br br i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question br br 0 out of stars
<START> cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films his only rival is andrew blake celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the dr's office sequence with her two other ladies is just incredible nearly as good is asia carrera's performance with the construction worker i highly recommend this movie gave it a 9 it's almost as good as cameron grant's elements of desire which i gave a 10
<START> 'the hills eyes ii' one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest or worst however you choose to look at it while 2006's 'hills' remake was one of the year's best and truly frightening horror films this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment part 2 never gets off the ground and neither does its mind numbing dialogue worst of all it's not that scary br br 2006's remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the new mexico desert deserted and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people people who as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago have become who they are surviving off travelers who wander into the region the sequel puts audiences in the same desert now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family when a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite they find it deserted with no signs of life a grim reality soon befalls them as they come to the realization that they're not alone and the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny br br it doesn't take a genius to realize that 'hills' has no legitimate reason to exist but because last year's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there's still money to be earned there's no rhyme or reason to it this time around just an unbelievable and ridiculous set up to pave the way for thoughtless characters unoriginal killings a non existent story and slipping interest originally director alexander aja made craven's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience one that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions its frank display of violence sadistic torture well rounded characterization and white knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences the second time around it's rehashed hand me downs there's no style no grit it tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies when all it really does is make for a been there done that kind film where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths br br it's a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention it's a bore nothing more 'hills' has no bite despite a jump or two here and there there's nothing very scary about this by the numbers horror flick it feels like something you'd see on the sci fi channel only with some f bombs a blood splatter here and there a rape and a graphic birth scene that's more gross than shocking it's cheap and with 'hills' you reap what you sew with no effort given you can't expect anything in return br br replacing aja with martin weisz as director was the film's first big mistake all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by wes craven and his son jonathan craven you ask how bad could it possibly be this is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like shakespeare craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past but i'd never expect something like this from him it's so unintentionally funny you have to wonder is craven playing a joke on this or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off the film's characters are one dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense the acting is just as bad the only character who may win you over is 'napoleon' napoli the scrawny kid who doesn't fit in with the others even the deranged and instinct driven villains who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago are met with indifferent you don't hate them you don't like them you honestly couldn't care less just like this movie br br even if you were giddy with fear during 'the hills have eyes' as i was you'll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage it's as generic as generic gets and there's absolutely nothing here we haven't seen done many times already i can't express this enough avoid 'the hills have eyes ii' like the plague it's frightless unoriginal frantic and a bore stick to the remake or craven's original vision because if you don't walk out after the first thirty minutes don't say i didn't warn you
<START> in this 'sequel' bruce is still called billy lo get it bruce billy lo lee no but apart from that that's all it has in common with the other movie billy doesn't seem to be an actor anymore he seems to be in another country he's more like a spy he's the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby sadly when bruce dies the movie pretty much dies with him this was extremely poorly made it seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming the footage works for a while it's not too obvious at first but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it's not bruce playing the part sadly when he dies the movie changes i can't help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep bruce alive but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead it's hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act to follow so it's hard to now accept bobby as the star bruce is never seen again in this movie i think they should have made this sequel without bruce he has a lame role in this movie people hoping to see a new bruce lee movie will be disappointed to see that although he's given the top billing he only has a featuring role even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit if there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about it's the scene where billy fights in a plant nursery ironically it doesn't even use bruce lee footage mind you they did it more convincingly in no retreat no surrender not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable bruce's girlfriend colleen camp is never mentioned my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother nothing else in the movie is worth watching i found it really sad to see bruce die i don't see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from enter the dragon this was a cheap way of trying to cash in on bruce's name oddly this and the original are credited in bruce's filmography thankfully so far no one has tried anything like this again 1981 was the year of bruce's last movie appearance it was a sad way to end it but thankfully this is proof that bruce's movie career should be left alone
<START> darius goes west is an amazing documentary about a teenager weems with duchenne muscular dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him on a cross country trip to see if pimp my ride will pimp out his wheelchair br br i recently watched this movie at the sunscreen film festival it played twice over the course of the festival this movie is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of weem's friends i do not say this often about movies but after watching this movie i feel moved to do something towards the cause every festival this movie has taken part in this movie has won an award of some kind it is in the tribeca film festival and it is going to london and athens greece i would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the academy awards it is snowballing out of control if anyone has a chance to see this movie wherever it is playing go take as many people as possible and go it is heading to new orleans for a film festival then on to atlanta and palm beach fl darius is from georgia so i expect the tickets for the atlanta showing will be sold out quickly if they are not already please go see this movie dgw talk about it br br kish
<START> last november i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival i have to say that it was a lot of fun a few tech errors aside it was a great experience i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role there is a lot of heart in this movie a lot of wit to i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done and they seemed real nice all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and one i'd definitely recommend the story was entertaining and cool as a woman i've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy and i could really understand his problems because of it the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with the friends in the movie are really well written to they are realistic i know people like these i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk the whole movie is just real cool i wish there were more films out there like it br br jayden
<START> if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years then it would have to be chalo di daar chalo chand ke paar chalo for its meaning the way it is sung by lata mangeshkar and mohd rafi the lyrics by kaif bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars the other would have to be chalte chalte pakeezah was meena kumari's last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen in each of the the songs that are picturised she looks young but after that she does not but one actor who didn't change in his looks was the late raj kumar who falls in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are br br conclusion pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs the movie stars the meena kumari raj kumar and ashok kumar and is directed by kamal amrohi br br kamal amrohi's grandson has now started to revive his grand father's studio by making a comedy movie
<START> this is a good film for 99 of the duration i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim br br it is shot in a rather naive fashion this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique br br the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe however the wholesome normal characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott br br the film starts slowly and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold hearted violence br br after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail biting scenes earlier on in the film br br give it a watch and excuse the ending
<START> saving grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana she's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors there's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user it's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny it's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
<START> this movie didn't really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought paul rieser wrote this huh well we'll see how he does then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate colombo even though i was never a big fan of the show i've always liked watching peter falk br br the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment and i hadn't even been drinking br br this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it but i couldn't find his number must be unlisted or something br br this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thought eh why not let's see if i don't like it i don't have to watch it and i ended up just loving it
<START> i just saw this recently after an interval of nearly forty years it holds up well especially lionel bart's outstanding songs who will buy with it's magical counterpoint just one of many standouts br br i disagree with the other post that decried its g rating the ratings system brand new at the time never intended the g general rating to mean completely devoid of conflict br br characterizing it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again
<START> when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean i'm sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's not their 40's the story was just plain bad and obnoxious br br dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it's just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they're just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls br br denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens it's more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell br br 1 10
<START> err this movie sucked a lot br br i have been reading some of the other reviews apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good br br i have watched several of his films in the vain hope that i'm missing something but no they just suck poorly written trash the characters are all very stereotypical not to mention rather stupid the plot is i think it is supposed to be mysterious not sure on that mr allen's character is woody allen on any other film you have seen of his br br if you are a fan of woody allen go see this film if you are under 50 don't bother if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under 50 well you are atypical i don't know what to say
<START> i saw this film at the ny gay lesbian film festival and thought it was pretty bad first and most distracting was the way much of it was shot that is a lot of slow motion and overly arty close ups that seemed to have no point story wise or aesthetically other than to show the skills of the cinematographer who i believe was also the director this film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with the lead actor sam levine was certainly very cute but was a mediocre actor at best and the rest of the cast ranged from so so to bad the story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable i do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film laughing and sighing constantly but i disliked it a great deal
<START> this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with real life dramas br br one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings it's an issue that has to be constantly addressed br br the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based on fact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it re enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals br br spoiler warning br br i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers it captured the themes of the story brilliantly br br i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well
<START> when stanwyck's husband to be is murdered on the eve of their wedding she retreats to a mountain lodge where she slips sort of off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan morgan falls in love with her leading to a definitely one sided marriage spent on a huge estate in chicago which appears to be surrounded by mountains stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez but eventually returns to morgan in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution br br this film has a great cast morgan in particular is one of my favorites and a great director but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed still worth watching for the cast and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films
