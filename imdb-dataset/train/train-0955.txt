<START> i must say that looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student brannagh's version of hamlet is by far the best his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded it helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the text br br one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare br br also his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end all in all not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature ph d to understand and enjoy it
<START> just saw this movie version of frank loesser's guys and dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando and she thought the havana sequences where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film directed by joseph l mankiewicz this movie which originated as a story by damon runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while the other story with frank sinatra and vivian blaine wasn't as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the sue me number also loved stubby kaye's sit down you're rocking the boat number and the performances of sheldon leonard and b s pully with a theatrical look throughout guys and dolls isn't a great film musical but certainly a very good one
<START> a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get semra turan plays aicha a second generation turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family nor with her liberal danish friends aicha's martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends br br director natasha arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse and drawing on xian gao's choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences in the end however it is semra turan's stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are complimented by heart to make her personal drama believable br br well worth your while

<START> i first saw the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out it blew my little head away i was only 16 and it was the first new wave music i'd heard having been a strictly folky classical kid growing up the music mesmerized me as did hazel o'connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances and phil daniels' tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart but i think my favorite character was jonathan pryce's drugged out sax player he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic he just begged for sympathy favorite scenes the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train br br okay so the movie isn't the rose but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80's exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the dole queue i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere i found when i was there br br if you get a chance to see it it is a great movie with some wonderful performances and the music will blow you away br br
<START> this is one of the greatest 80s movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i can't believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart i speak a no enlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed what's up with that and i love ron leibman he's foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course he's not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national lampoon's vacation if you liked movies such as porky's fast times last american virgin or any of the other 80s teen focused movies you'll love this one rent it and you'll see what i mean
<START> the story idea is excellent unfortunately the execution lets it down br br the movie lacks pace for one thing it should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little boring br br i think the problem's mainly in the screenplay and editing there aren't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense and there are scenes which don't really move the story along very effectively br br the producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite unfortunately when the producer is also the writer and the director this evidently ain't gonna happen br br much of the acting seems kind of flat and that is down to the director all the actors have been quite competent in other projects br br it's a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller
<START> coinciding with the start of the baby boom the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes directed by h c potter and co written by norman panama and melvin frank white christmas this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well of course it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs Â cary grant myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas Â head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership even though the film is sixty years old now there is a timeless quality to the blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it obviously hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice first as a very physical tom hanks comedy 1986's the money pit and again last year with ice cube's are we done yet one look at hgtv's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today br br the plot begins with ad man jim blandings his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom one bath manhattan apartment rather than pursue muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for 7 000 jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair however the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first costs rise with each new complication tempers flare and even a romantic triangle is imagined among jim muriel and bill priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not so blissful ignorance of the new homeowners br br with his double takes and flawless line delivery grant is infallible in this type of farce and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid career characters in a role originally meant for irene dunne myrna loy shows why she was hollywood's perfect wife she doesn't get many of the funnier lines but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette as avuncular pipe smoking bill coleÂbill cole melvyn douglas shows his natural easy going Ã©lan as grant's foil smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well digger mr tesander lurene tuttle as jim's officious assistant mary and louise beavers as the blandings' lovable maid gussie the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then wife actress betsy drake a most appropriate 1949 cartoon the house of tomorrow is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant's film classics complete the extras
<START> a sentimental school drama set in denmark 1969 we shall overcome offers a pathetic danish take on us culture frits janus dissing rathke a flower power obsessed naive 13 year old exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master lindum svendsen's bent mejding office lindum svendsen a school director portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant has the local community in control lindum svendsen's gone too far this time and with his father recovering from a mental breakdown sure there wasn't enough drama already and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher mr svale 'hi call me freddie' frits stands up for justice br br tell you what it's so unconvincing over method acted and so full of misery that as a 'family' picture this grotesque filled with clichÃ©'s excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non scandinavian audiences sorry kind danish readers to crash like this into your sentimental journeys but it's definitely not a tale about a 'boy becoming a man by fighting the system' the boy never becomes a man but rather remains a naive big eyed cry face if you call a church of small minded small town folk led by a dictator like cartoonish character the system i'm sorry if i'm missing something br br if you're into family pictures go see happy feet instead
<START> not that i was really surprised movies are never as good as the books that they originated from i was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books even though i knew it would probably suck i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised however they strayed from the book's storyline too much and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was ending was different too lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery the acting was unremarkable at best perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in lifetime's made for tv movie box it would be a better flick if you saw this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book and read it i doubt you'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it
<START> i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead you gotta love those bargain packs for even if they don't feature true remastering restoration and all that hoo ha and the films are generally in full frame pan and scan format there's no denying that there are always a few gems included and by gems i mean there's always some good crap to be seen especially if the films are from the '70s as the mansion of madness is br br my copy is called mansion of madness but when the title screens roll it's poe's dr tarr's torture dungeon doesn't matter really as crap is crap is crap no yes but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all there are some funky elements here and there and obviously the flick did have a decent budget br br the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look the dialogue is always hilarious near the beginning of the film the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road what strength says our hero funny then that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun you'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end that's how memorable these characters are br br the best part about mansion of madness however has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure it's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable and why all the weirdo slapstick anyway i'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop what the hell oh yeah there's plenty of boobies to be seen too for those of you that dig such things boobies bad dialogue and wacky music that best sums of mansion of madness for me it's well worth at least one viewing and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot i can't say i was ever bored watching it but i can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot but not hmm br br and mr chicken pwnz
<START> mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde plaguing the terrified community br br this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic pictures one of hollywood's poverty row studios the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality overall it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort br br even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development the film can boast of a good cast grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely alarmed dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be conveniently miss wray's boyfriend br br maude eburne who could be extremely funny given the right situation steals most of her scenes as miss wray's hypochondriac aunt elderly lionel belmore plays the village's terrified burgermeister and little dwight frye who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films here is most effective as a bat loving lunatic
<START> antwone fisher is the story of a young emotionally troubled u s navy seaman his problems lead him to jerome davenport a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing br br get ready to shed a tear or two the movie could thaw the coldest heart i loved the story which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending antwone fisher is a powerful movie most importantly about forgiveness other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse adoption and foster care br br oscar winner denzel washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut there were many scenes which i enjoyed watching they included the beginning dreams of a little boy Â check out the gigantic sized pancakes and the ending dreams turned into reality which beautifully tied the story together br br another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him br br my favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him priceless br br all the actors represented their parts well br br in addition to directorial responsibilities mr washington continues to show why he won an oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles he had a strong presence in this movie br br actor derek luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of antwone fisher he portrayed very real and heart tugging work br br joy bryant who played the part of cheryl antwone's love interest resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen the chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters br br novella nelson who played the part of mrs tate a despicable character deserves special mention br br although we only see her for a few minutes the actress who played fisher's mother gave an outstanding performance br br everyone should see antwone fisher
<START> the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect lv2 must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in lv2 everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved lv1 just don't see this film just see lv1 again
<START> i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond i don't think it's garbage it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat this is a good movie for kids no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids
<START> there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building each character unfolds more and more each series also each series has an array of different 'small time characters' as well as the main a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick every little detail builds the perfect tv series the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable whilst tony runs things with capos paulie tony sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christopher michael imperioli looks for a promotion every episode also features tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano edie falco on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic chianese is trying to get what he can out of tony's businesses despite being under house arrest all the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who 'is' tony soprano also michael imperioli who plays christopher representing the younger 20 30 generation in crime if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as the wire and dexter so the sopranos is definitely the godfather goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
<START> i was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film which was shot on location in alaska although technically a melodrama we see lots of activities eskimos are involved in such as hunting dancing building igloos etc and their customs such as offering their wives to visitors are routinely in the story the hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals but even these were fascinating spear fishing for salmon hunting for walrus caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times there was no cast listing which reinforced the documentary flavor the film makers tried to make it seem very authentic with the natives speaking only in an eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles the introduction stated that except for the white traders and the royal mounted canadian police there were no actors in the film but this was not strictly true the two leading characters played by mala and lotus long were eskimos by birth but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on but they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have hollywood careers all in all the film is definitely worth a look
<START> i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning i'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of joseph's story br br however that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score if you get to salt lake city it is a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire life i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that i'm lds and regard joseph as a prophet i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started anyway i'm told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells a fascinating story
<START> jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this modern musical that showcases macdonald's comic abilities surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue eye popping costumes and sets yes b w add to the surreal dreamlike quality of the entire film several good songs enliven the film with the twinkle in your eye number a total highlight including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes also in the huge cast are edward everett horton reginal owen mona maris douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale almira sessions grace hayle gertrude hoffman rafaela ottiano odette myrtile cecil cunningham and many others br br great fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her jitterbug vamp routines she could do it all
<START> occasionally one is served a new entrÃ©e from foreign films that is their great attraction they take from life and serve it up raw american films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society too many hang ups and a morbid fear of financial failure the almighty dollar determines their selections something which invites european directors in addition audiences world wide remain hungry for different films especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched suffering body of humanity despite the fear of directors or producers many audiences yearn for beauty poetry and the pristine flavor of life that is what the film to the left of the father offers to curious audiences a family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans filled with raging unbridled dreams and dark passions then the two are set in motions against itself selton mello plays andrÃ© a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father raul cortez plays his father simone spoladore is ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters leonardo medeiros is pedro the elder brother the film offers much but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it
