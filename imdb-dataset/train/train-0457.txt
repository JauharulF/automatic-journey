<START> i gave timecop a perfect 10 i gave this 1 br br it's story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in 2060 if i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous confused br br and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them aren't only the first one is great and there aren't many action scenes at all and they're all pretty short br br at one point in the story the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes no wait make that two times br br in short don't waste time watching this movie it's not worth it
<START> i've seen this movie after watching paltrow's version i've found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better austen's knightley anyway both versions are good but anyone that loved austen's books should watch this movie i agree with caalling andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original br br 10 out of 10 br br my 2 cents
<START> i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the t v and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyone's life i give it a 10 more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didn't even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
<START> i'm going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count but that would be about it let me explain i paid literally Â£1 for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks b movies especially but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons which i'll touch on in a sec then it failed magnificently not only did it shoot for b and miss it landed somewhere around f this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts i say above that it's likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror which can either be very good or very bad for example later freddy films dream warriors onwards are all about freddy's style and nose thumbing which works out great but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good in fact for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills for instance when 'satan' smashes the cat against the board and writes 'boo' with it's blood using its body as a brush or when 'satan' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman now i'm not usually too against senseless kills in films hey thats the point right but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film plot especially for me the film went downwards from then on one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it the kid dougie was just ridiculously annoying i'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick i mean come on i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help but this kid took the biscuit i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say 'duh ' one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall because thats what watching this film felt like why didn't i just turn the film off mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film but i was wrong in this case the ending did not redeem this film it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line i get it already the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume i get it this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film watch out for the intestines frankly if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that i'd be surprised he wasn't already dead let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair br br in fact i'll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer purely because when his 'comedy routine' worked it did work all in all the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down why was the killer killing i don't know i can live without knowing who he actually was thats fairly typical but without some kind of motive hell i don't know i'd settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid it just seems more than senseless just stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid in fact i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it save your money save your sanity stay away from it
<START> this movie is complete crap avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70's sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman's bare ass but don't waste your time or money as you won't get either back
<START> what is happening to itv drama first losing gemma quite simply the worst tv drama i have seen in years and now perfect parents a complete shambles from start to finish whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there p45 by special delivery br br in most drama thrillers a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop but perfect parents took this to a new level i suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense i felt i had been force fed on a lorry load of magic mushrooms it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a drama by numbers involving some serious issues religion education greed fear murder paedophillia the only trouble was as the great eric morecambe once said when playing a piano i'm playing all the right notes just not necessarily in the correct order for your next script guys i suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than script writing for dummies br br due to the ridiculous script and the utter lack of tension in the direction the acting was suitably low key not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch but i suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman attempts to deliver a script from itv drama department make sure the letterbox is firmly nailed shut
<START> i saw the mst3k version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much even unmystied that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh br br nothing about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it too much ugliness and nudity i guess either ds 3 was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar i e stupid and carefree and simple i was wrong even at 6 99 it seemed a waste of money i didn't even open ds 2 as i will return it tomorrow now i'll probably just throw away this dvd as i can't return it and no one wants it including myself so really don't bother with this one even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and icky
<START> do you still love woody allen's humor and sense of the absurd do you wait patiently for movies that get the plot going in the first five minutes instead of making you wait around if so you will adore this comedic murder mystery it has all the elements of a good mystery sharp plot a handsome suspect romance and intrigue mixed together with enough laughs and winks at fate to keep even the most jaded of movie goers happy br br with beautiful people and gorgeous homes and landscapes to ogle this frothy movie is just the thing to take your minds off your troubles as woody might say what's not to like
<START> for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detective made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is bayless of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv
<START> i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of jerry springer i don't consider myself a snob but i really think that i am above watching what's on his show you should try to elevate yourself above that too br br i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was conducting i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on springer handled better this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are i will admit i felt a twinge of empathy for connie molly hagan this is all she has in life how sad that she feels she must go on jerry's show in order to resolve this br br i really feel sorry for molly hagan appearing in this have you noticed that after this movie she has mainly been relegated to b roles on tv i will say this about hagan she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy the problem is that hagan can't carry a scene on her own she just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role her best work will always be angel on herman's head a show that was not great but its heart was in the right place and when she guested on seinfeld as sister roberta
<START> bela lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit which was also the source of a feature film where lugosi played the villain lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way here chandu returns from the east in order to help the princess nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult this is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun to be certain the pacing is a bit slack more akin to one of principals the producing studios features then a rip roaring adventure but it's still enjoyable this plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that hey i missed something one of the trilogy of three good serials lugosi made the others being sos coast guard and phantom creeps
<START> when watching little man you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy your supposed to be laughing at it but will you probably not br br the main problem with little man is its concept its far too ridiculous to accept even as a cartoonish comedy so when the loud laboured and over the top jokes kick in they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is br br but its a comedy some of you might be screaming thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot i mean come on think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man i mean seriously what br br its not about the plot its about the laughs you might be screaming well heres the thing see there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more br br if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs what ever you do steer clear of little man
<START> this movie stars emily watson of breaking the waves fame this movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love at first sight with a woman played by emily watson she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess this is all at the dismay of her mother who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman a proper gentleman her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such what ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present emily watson is amazing in this as well as the actor who plays the main character it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching the ending was even satisfying
<START> for all of you that don't speak swedish the swedish original title of this film rÃ¥narna translates into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause it's not really about the robbers at all it's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly we've seen this before the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as clichÃ© as the first two thirds of the film br br what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story br br one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car chases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but that's something you have to neglect br br all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you 7 10
<START> first of all i must admit batman the animated series is the best batman series by far we watched it when it used to be on tv i didn't realize that there was a season four actually there wasn't btas ends with season 3 and it should have stopped there br br why did they have to mess with a good thing catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces the joker looks beyond scary it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier he doesn't seem to have pupils anymore and now he doesn't even look remotely human although he is br br bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman although he now looks like superman there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same bruce wayne now has blue eyes br br night wing really needs a haircut please alfred just has pupils from eyes looks more like a character from the 80's br br i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic there is blood in every episode br br if you are a fan of batman the animated series there is no batman season 4 they just included this series as season 4 for marketability if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don't think as many people would have bought it br br save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1 3
<START> you wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't it's a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand held camera and it's hilarious the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings there is no plot to be seen the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs it's a funny and sickening film and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie br br my rating bomb 90 mins
<START> a youth gets a bad hair day goes out on a hill and falls into where he can't escape then he meets mr atlas a mythological dude from 2 000 years ago as his very best friend and an arnold schwarzenegger look and sound alike his herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and later adjusts to modern life so what's the big deal this is the lousiest idea for a family outing either way this one shouldn't have been attempted at all really our fictional character of might and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe to add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing and before you know it there is some attempted violence that doesn't qualify this as family entertainment the scene where atlas complains of his undershorts is gaggling though just spend a nice quiet afternoon in the park for a change
<START> by now you've probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki's classic film laputa castle in the sky during late summer of 1998 disney released kiki's delivery service on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in 1999 it's obviously way past that year now but the dub has been finally completed and it's not laputa castle in the sky just castle in the sky for the dub since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub you've also probably heard that world renowned composer joe hisaishi who scored the movie originally went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements laputa came out before my neighbor totoro and after nausicaa of the valley of the wind which began studio ghibli and it's long string of hits and in my opinion i think it's one of miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem laputa castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it br br for those unfamiliar with castle in the sky's story it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted you see miyazaki's true vision and believe me it's one fantastic one the film begins with sheeta a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship sheeta holds the key to laputa the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization the key to laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many namely the government the military and the air pirate group the dola gang who sheeta and pazu later befriend soon the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid she falls a few thousand feet but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant as she floats down from the sky pazu an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines sees sheeta and catches her the two become fast friends but thanks to her pendant the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the dola gang and government try to capture sheeta one action sequence after another we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue plus somewhat twisty surprise i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time the story is wonderful as we peak into hayao miyazaki's animation which has no limits the setting of the film is a combo of many time periods it does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons laputa is also surprisingly a funny film the film has tons of hilarious moments almost equal to the drama and action the film holds i think the funniest part is a fight scene where pazu's boss faces off against a pirate and soon after a riot breaks out it's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly br br now let's talk about how the dub rates an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life teen heartthrob james van der beek plays the hero pazu who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version where in the original he sounded more childlike either way i think his voice is a nice fit with pazu anna paquin the young oscar winner from the piano plays sheeta this is also a nice performance but the voice is a bit uneven she doesn't stay true to one accent at times she sounds as american as apple pie but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman who played mama dola not only is this an excellent performance but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life if there was ever a live action laputa movie g d forbid she would be the one to play her you can just imagine her in the role well somewhat luke skywalker himself mark hamill is muska and this is another top rate hamill performance you may be familiar with hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies but he renders muska to full evil his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series rounding out the cast is voice character actor jim cummings who does a great gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy patakin as members of the dola gang br br now let me talk about what really makes this dub special joe hisaishi's newly arranged music for those who have never heard of him mr hisaishi does the music and like all of miyazaki's films the music is very memorable each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly now these new arrangements he has done are more american like which i think was the goal of the new recordings don't worry the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form the score to me sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster it has more power it has more emphasis it's clearer and deeper the film's prologue the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships has some new music i am not sure but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy things seem very enhanced in a powerful scene the music is more stronger then in the original versions in a calm scene it's more calmer overall i think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes i highly did myself and personally think it helps improve the film i prefer the new score over the old one and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack br br another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful and much of the original japanese lines are intact in kiki i'm sure a few lines where changed and this is the same way lines have been changed but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered but they were there intact some new lines have been added as well which help out but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing disney did not translate the ending song it was in japanese i was mortified when they did completely new songs for the kiki dub but with this version it's the original song in japanese so i guess it's good it's still the original but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english br br there is a big down side to this dub and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips of course in any dub it won't be perfect but i think in kiki and mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed and disney had a little bit more time with this one some of the time everything matches perfect some of the time it doesn't completley match and in a rare case someone says something and the lips don't move at all there's a scene where sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit br br as far as things about the film itself these are my thoughts i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation from the opening sequence to the ending the animation is so lush and detailed you just have to watch in awe you see the true nature of each character true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn it's like a moving piece of art and to think this was done in the mid 1980's the animation is quite different from disney ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different but very good and after all these years the colors look as vibrant as ever laputa also has tons of action sequences lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground these sequences are so well done and so intriguing it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film and the finale is just something you must see the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions guns firing and everything else well and like all miyazaki films each one focuses on a different theme i g kiki confidence this one has a great a lesson on greed and power people don't realize how greed can take over you and how having too much power isn't good people are obsessed with power and are greedy and the main villian muska greatly shows this br br all in all laputa castle in the sky was a great film to begin with and is now improved for the most part i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the kiki and princess mononoke disney dubs castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film
<START> i just viewed this movie last night and i don't think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mind br br the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson i will think of tinseltown which is a very bad thing br br i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman i thought that it at least wouldn't be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrong br br this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes br br the characters are paper thin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they don't even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to gilligan's island br br the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national lampoon's favorite deadly sins the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this movie br br the actors try kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i don't think it was the actors fault because they have bad material br br go watch the national lampoon's movie but stay away from this movie
<START> what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 hrs to kill watch it you won't regret it it's too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him i still liked it the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
