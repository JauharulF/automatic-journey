<START> this movie was as homer simpson would have put it more boring than church maybe i don't understand it well enough and i thought it started out pretty well but after start of spoiler hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts working sleeping with her boss it just started to drag and i struggled to keep awake again maybe it symbolizes something but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place end of spoiler in the end i fail to see why others think it's so great as i found it extremely boring by the way i did not watch this movie by my own free will as i was required to see it for a film class
<START> i'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre but even by the standards of low low budget exploitation this one is really lame even on a nudity and gore level it's incredibly boring there is some of both but it's all sort of meh before the home video revolution it might not even have been released theatrically though it might have after all plan 9 from outer space played in theaters there is precisely one good and competently delivered line in the entire movie i assume they stole it from somewhere br br the acting is among the worst i have ever seen i mean even ed wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy which can be fun to watch anyway most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate here those who don't read their lines like cigar store indians sound like they learned them phonetically and this film does have one distinction it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie then laughably overplotted for the ending br br update i should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception she is by no means wooden not that she's good but she certainly isn't wooden br br even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness but with this one there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about br br and you know the funniest thing they clearly expected to make a sequel br br it's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way i sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it
<START> moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasn't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were if you're a fan br br i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re watchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining br br it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert footage br br if you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if you're not a fan don't like michael jackson steer well clear br br 9 10
<START> rock star inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched it had some of the greatest rock n' roll songs ever written performed by 15 very talented singers performers it also had in my opinion the most heart felt feel good surprise endings in all of reality tv it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner over the 13 weeks of this televised competition the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants after 30 some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show and the fact that inxs was and still is one of the greatest rock n' roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series if you don't have the series recorded rock star inxs the dvd is a great alternative
<START> i first saw this movie 3 years ago and it was introduced by then disney chief eisner and the real jim morris br br about a month ago it came back on tv and this time i taped it since then i must've watched it at least three times br br this is a wonderful inspirational feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned it resists going for every sentimental trick in the book as well as all of the other clichÃ©s br br it is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads br br these are just normal people who have dreams like you and i br br in my opinion hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term gritty realism making movies where everyone curses and has problems with aggression br br this movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream the people in big lake tx seem so personable that i want to move there br br as i said b4 the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality dennis quaid as usual never disappoints i've watched him from the late 70's and he is so underrated br br but this movie has excellent performances from everyone concerned and kudos to the writers br br a gem in the movie is near the end when jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game and his wife calls out to him from the stands he rushes over and reaches out to his family the look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless br br if you're looking for a change of pace then pick this movie up
<START> in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so it is amazing i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
<START> when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film usually when you have these types of movies there's generally one sasquatch but in this one there is like what 7 or 10 of them acting was good plot was ok i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims very good camera work i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little this movie was way better than sasquatch the sci fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain abominibal was not good the one i'm reviewing is ok but the movie sasquatch was not but i'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon but for any other occasions no
<START> this is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older married lover after she gets pregnant she avenges herself against him and his entire family through black magic ÂÂ which disappointingly she doesn't do herself but has someone else do for her good production values for a thai horror flick but the bland script never generates suspense the director approaches the material entirely conventionally and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds at one point a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun bad writing Â you're soaking in it br br some icky gore effects including a really tasteless late term fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in asia in the last 15 years
<START> this movie is the worst ive seen nicole kidman really dissapointed me this movie has nothing i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth great actors but bad script
<START> i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with drug induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children br br it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough i'll grant you but still acceptable br br then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books br br so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair br br and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem br br the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i don't know where i would have preferred to live br br in summary this movie is terrifying br br if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy
<START> yeah i remember this one many years since i actually watched it the story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at it's the same with first kid which follows a similar pattern certain movies like this one here just aim at plain and comical nonsense such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack first class acting but if they do fulfil their primary premise that's okay i don't have this movie here on my list of all time favorites but i still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway
<START> as if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori 1973 which i had watched earlier this year the marquee value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters apart from not looking minimally sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl antonio sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter's spirited teenage niece besides for a gangster flick there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else incidentally the bargain basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members or even the film's title is ever listed
<START> i have not seen this movie at least not in its entirety i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all one sequence remains in my memory to this day a very convincing looking spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him the moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is parallel lines squares could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth wonderful i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie
<START> if mr cranky had rated this i'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here but as he hasn't i'll have to give it a go myself br br the only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that malcolm mcdowall's acting is excellent however not even he can save this film from disaster the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity reminiscent of bad '70's movies even worse both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was br br it's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container slave ship to nigeria this ship's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb 12 or something the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name br br i honestly can't find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me malcolm mcdowall in particular i won't hold this against him as he's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie br br so unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you're male and you're doctor isn't doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you're really community minded buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster
<START> i actually had hopes for this movie since i've seen kari in a few other things and think she has some talent alas this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability and no plot whatsoever is it a road buddy comedy thriller romance drama the filmmakers don't have a clue and neither do we
<START> terry gilliam's and david peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's people's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time Â i especially love the idea one can't change the past it's a nice counterpoint to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise Â biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originality br br the story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he'll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travelling technology isn't perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas br br i watched this movie once around 10 years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days after wards for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important i've re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it's better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes he's in playing jeffrey goines Â almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club Â a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist ideas who's also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie pitt's eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands pitt's oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce willis' performance his i didn't remember very well but it's beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole didn't start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole's shrink dr kathryn railly finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds away br br there are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who's witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help railly's character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help cole Â first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission Â the more they're sucked into tragedy br br the twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling cole's mission hasn't been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it's not supposed to be art although it's more artists than many artistic movies it's an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece
<START> wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably can't even play the instruments number 2 on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really don't hate it that bad i'd give it like a 4 out of 10 but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didn't get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon
<START> i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place however the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better all in all this is a great and valuable film slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream it's a thrilling and interesting movie experience
<START> i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureen's character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because she's a few years older hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get you're in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film Â a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn't and get killed br br 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny
<START> a brilliant russian Ã©migrÃ© devises the Âstanislavsky' system for winning at contract bridge which makes him and his beautiful wife the grand slam sweethearts of america br br what could have been just another silly soap opera is elevated by fine production values excellent acting to the status of a very enjoyable little comedy a few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer's attention engaged the way in which the principle cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards the introduction of a zany acrobat into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of lunacy and the way in which a wide variety of different kinds of americans are shown to be transfixed by listening to the broadcast of the concluding game br br paul lukas loretta young do very well as the bridge sweethearts lukas suave sophisticated and miss young passionately loving and beautiful even if the script keeps her puffing on a cigarette a bit too much they are fun to watch even when their behavior is not always the most believable or compelling br br frank mchugh gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores miss young the delightful glenda farrell eschews her customary wisecracking persona in a small role as mchugh's ditsy gal pal roscoe karns handles the fast talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer diminutive ferdinand gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert br br movie mavens will recognize dewey robinson as a belligerent nightclub patron emma dunn as a sob sister reporter paul porcasi as the owner of the russian nightclub charles lane as a russian waiter and jimmy conlin as a kibitzer at the final bridge game all uncredited br br the film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the 1920's it expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed
