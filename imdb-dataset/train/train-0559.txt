<START> one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga the sure thing the fly 2 her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettable br br during their christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways br br exploiting every stalk 'n' slash clichÃ© in the book director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths which let's face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody dismembered corpseÂthe film could've done with more br br at the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only
<START> a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic schmid's triumph over disability and depression the battle scene was superb but one bone to pick no matter how many 50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts it hurt the realism but i can live with it fine performance by eleanor parker again as his girl friend
<START> let's cut to the chase this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the american pie teat period br br the whole plot and that shouldn't imply that there's a whole lot to go around serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes br br if you're a tween guy and you're too squeamish to purchase actual pornography then this is the movie for you otherwise the movie doesn't have much to offer at all br br the acting is sub par the character development is virtually non existent and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity binge drinking and pranks none of which are particularly memorable br br go buy real porn if that's what you want to see and if not go watch a good movie animal house kids or even the original american pie are all great cinematic works and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity br br it's not how much it's how you use it
<START> i expected this to be a lot better i love tim burton's work so i was really excited to see these online short films well they weren't at all what i had expected br br i don't really know what exactly it is i don't like i guess they're just sort of dull the sound bothers me and most of the characters although i loved roy the toxic boy and stainboy br br the match girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty funny br br i also don't like the way some of the characters die like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the girl who stares died in general roy's death was amusing surprisingly death by a car freshener very original that made me laugh so hard br br there are some things that aren't appropriate for kids just some language and gore that's about all i have to say 3 10
<START> really br br i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here br br this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is one big pathetic grainy clichÃ© i would have laughed out loud and a lot but was on a date with an ex military guy i could not hide my other response boredom yes i think my date a flat line good old boy liked it that's not a compliment i know an actor wants to work fine for the others but ralph come on br br it was a painful tease from ralph i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning but i must plead ralph how could you and why br br i'm going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now c1
<START> i just saw this movie on tv br br i've lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me br br i can feel the lost that the little girl desi felt br br the feeling of wanting to see her father again br br wanting to talk to him br br or at least given the chance to say goodbye br br and i'm so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her br br saying that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn't a shop in heaven br br it just lets me feel that miracles do exist
<START> okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it's about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses there's garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the comedy's not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn't deserve that many laughs but of course everyone's opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you're welcome to do so
<START> a film that is so much a 30's warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object br br curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres br br even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that they're not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing br br thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub plot so the fun can just keep rolling along
<START> i hired out hybrid on the weekend what a disappointment a stupid lame attempt at a tele movie the guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running he did a lot looked like he was eating those minty sweets with his backside the wolf contacts he wore were great though i feel the actor relied on them too much as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all the wise native american indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen talk about a sour cow she smiled about once for the entire film and i think that is because she had sex the sex scene was lame too they may as well have shown blowing curtains if you can dig that br br last of all and this is a big pet hate of mine on the cover and the dvd menu the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy they were nowhere to be seen in the film
<START> i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone the picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there is is just plain stupid i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it
<START> the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan 9 from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan 9 companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater
<START> br br not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak english with an australian accent they also call their stars by the same names our earthly astronomers have given them br br and topping all that off all alien life knows just how mean evil wasteful and destructive us humans are and they're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is br br if you ever have the chance to see this movie don't well unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia br br this movie tries to get a moral ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon
<START> europa zentropa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago this film is truly unique and a work of genius the camerawork and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience br br the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator br br a one of a kind movie four stars highest rating
<START> must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film br br i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
<START> movie industry is tricky business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too that's the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an 'insightful' film about film and indeed no better proof of the industry's trickiness than seeing anouk aimÃ©e and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self do the latter please or our relationship is not only professional it's private as well it's a rather complex situation to handle isn't it yes it is my dear between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel lobbies and american movie posters no sign of non american film presence on the croisette recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame
<START> i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess that's hollywood
<START> a charming little film set in the uk about the reunion of a wwii all girl almost swing band a fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by dench and laine's always great pipes time well spent and a fun watch for all
<START> alas poor hamlet i knew him dear reader and let me tell thee this version sucks i don't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam but i hope that they're proud of themselves they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable this version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like maximilian schell in the title role can save it this movie's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for mst3k mike servo and crow had a lot of fun with this one br br but either way i'm sure that shakespeare had he been alive when they made this would not have wanted his name associated with it this hamlet is not even so bad that's it good it's just plain bad absolutely dreadful
<START> there are some films that every horror fan owes himself or herself to see and emilio miraglia's la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka the red queen kills seven times 1972 is definitely one of them with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub genres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes miraglia's earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave 1971 was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either sub genre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spine chilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror br br the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany as little girls kitty wildenbrÃ¼ck and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people fourteen years later kitty barbara bouchet has become a successful fashion photographer suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot wise the haunting painting in the grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps the red lady or red queen as she is called in the english title is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo the spine chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that the ravishing barbara bouchet one of my favorite actresses must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too bouchet's presence has graded up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year 1972 fernando di leo's milano calibro 9 lucio fulci's giallo highlight don't torture a duckling and this unforgettable gem apart from the wonderful miss bouchet the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning marina malfatti the night evelyn came out of the grave and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera br br as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory bruno nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tension level increses with each passing minute the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a top priority for every fan of horror and or italian cinema to see 10 10
