<START> well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something i wasn't exactly looking for 'a splatterfest' as someone puts it or even 'blood and guts gore' i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn't they were nameless faceless and meaningless just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics br br i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'what makes a guy be a serial killer ' as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story of which i know very little people here seem to think that the movie didn't have to cover the events of the dahmer story i e his history what happened when he got caught the aftermath etc but it is important you see i assume if you are american you will know all of this we do not all live in america to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told shown this doesn't mean blood and guts there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore without even touching upon some of what he did i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site the movie felt like a void a moment in time with very little substance i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction very slow pace that never changes strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending this movie is poor i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it a definite 1 out of 10 for the acting
<START> platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to heavyweight championship boxing oliver stone's story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable while most or all of the occurrences in platoon did occur over the 10 year span of us military involvement in vietnam to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame weeks gives a horribly skewed picture of the war in platoon the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two us soldiers murdering civilians us soldiers raping civilians a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant a us private murdering a us staff sergeant us soldiers killed wounded by friendly fire 90 killed or wounded in the platoon for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam is a disgrace two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam and hbo's a bright shining lie

<START> had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel look my taste is like any others' eclectic my favorites run from blue velvet to dr strangelove to the ghost and mrs muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one eraserhead repo man and the spy within br br the man in the moon is superbly made a gentle hearted joyous and tragic film beautifully filmed one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting br br it's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all br br rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours br br if you purchase no other film please purchase the man in the moon this moving story is one you'll enjoy reliving time and again it is a joy and a gem a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts br br the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold br br paul vincent zecchino br br manasota key florida br br 05 april 2009
<START> just picked up this film for a buck at national wholesale liquidators and after watching it i feel like i got ripped off br br i don't know that i've seen a worse film than this honestly and i would never write a negative review of a film had i not such enormous respect for the subject matter that is stephen foster and his music br br first what is it it's a musical biography yeah lot's of tunes by foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo broadway jerome kern type numbers that reek more than the mississippi delta i mean somebody got paid to write this drivel secondly the real story of foster is a fascinating one why not even come close to it thirdly what did they have on the great ray middleton to get him to do this film pictures of him with small boys with communists what a waste of a great talent br br so friends of foster and the truth and good entertainment be afraid be very very afraid
<START> i watched this movie 10 years ago and have watched it on video an average of once a year since it's the type of movie that's timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two very involving characters this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv and now the phenomenon is rampant i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters it also made me want to ride the train around europe i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie
<START> plot melissa is a new girl in town she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die br br to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie when i started watching it i realized that sweet sixteen isn't a very good slasher it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way br br the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa's character is easy to sympathize with even though she's a complete slut br br the story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie br br all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere i'd definitely wouldn't recommend it to slasher fans
<START> the 40 year old virgin 2005 steve carell catherine keener paul rudd romany malco seth rogen elizabeth banks leslie mann jane lynch gerry bednob shelley malil kat dennings hysterically funny high concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a list a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co worker buddies rudd malco rogen each one degree funnier than the next determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost what follows is an unlikely yet very warm hearted romance with a vivacious mother the marvelous keener having lots of fun here leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy a surprisingly good spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy the funniest since there's something about mary with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke homophobic debunking ribbing send ups of 'date a paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb a true winner and an instant classic the funniest film of the year
<START> there are many problems with mystery men first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special paul reubens is wasted in a pathetic juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent br br now onto the decent parts william h macy three heavenly words and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs ben stiller is very amusing as well showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes all of the characters do and that is an area which i found particuarly ironic that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of hollywood br br to be honest the reason i thought it failed at the box office is that america doesn't get irony br br all in all i loved the film but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscapes and effects
<START> towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy's gaunt latter day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image she convinces one that if a nasty bette davis type role were to come her way she could carry it off brilliantly unfortunately i can't find many other reasons for seeing this if you've wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old fashioned glasses but why should anyone then here's your answer for the rest sally kirkland's sex starved crazy woman is really tiresome and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role of the leading actors nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul keller's plight and his acting is wooden dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little sheedy's meticulous understated performance though she often seems to be on automatic pilot is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest the sets are drab the camera work undistinguished
<START> it' just funny watch it br br ok they want 10 lines so there this is a spoof of 50s 70s werewolf movies lots of satire some political feels like an early clouseau movie probably due to alan arkin but with less slap stick if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too once again less slapstick in this one br br actually the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo unavoidable in a teen comedy to really poignant socio political satire the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious there are tons of histarical cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation br br anyway just watch the movie if you get a chance
<START> this movie is fun to watch doesnt have much of a plot well there isn't a plot but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date while chong is partying with cheech's cousin they smoke dope go in a music store a massage parlor a comedy club and even go into someones house they don't even know rated r
<START> diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side the way mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking and if you think you do you are wrong br br diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology br br as for it being for old people i am 24 i don't think i can be classed as old yet br br i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd not ntsc so that i can watch them all in order they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen everyone involved should be embarrassed everyone ice t is pitiful the dialogue is absolutely awful and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie the plot steals heavily from executive decision but compared to air rage executive decision is academy award material i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie air rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending when the credits rolled this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br ice t should stick to law and order and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide either way they should never attempt to be in a movie again
<START> back in 2004 i saw true tom tykwer's contribution to paris je t'aime when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached etc br br yesterday i finally saw it courtesy of the internet br br first of all i must say that it looks awesome the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special but still brilliant and clear later i read the trivia here and maybe it's how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dp's work my special favorites are the quais de seine first scene that sunlight the sin city esquire but better for me quartier de la madeleine and 14th arrondisement but you know what the hell i like them all true or faubourg saint denis still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours my eyes they tremble and quartier latin is gold imprisoned on silver beautiful br br yes these are some beautiful short films br br now let's get onto the content i very much and i mean very much like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy chinese musical in paris with barbet schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue i love surprises and this film has them it's great they took a chance to let all these director's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema which i have come to heavily despise it's not heavily experimental but i can breath the breathing space these people had br br i like the small time and i love the acting i love the simplicity and i love the love i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it's a film that is very very very nice to see alone or with someone to simply feel it left me feeling very good br br there is something about the earnestness in it it's so frank br br what i didn't like well for me there are two shorts that aren't exactly the best quais de seine which is good natured sure and maybe even necessary but feels too much like a commercial and pÃ¨re lachaise that even though i love the acting i felt it's themes were forced but that of course is just me tour eiffel i also didn't love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet i don't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor's and directors and so they can delight in their interaction in the surprises look out for alexander payne in a funny role and basically in what will this director do with this great question i enjoyed it very much in that way br br i repeat now most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix i definitely recommend it definitely so watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love
<START> the film a universal release of a protelco mlc production is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object capturing it in a cell as pure energy and then sending it back complete to a target area there is no explanation why this is necessary but professor paul steiner played by pock mocked actor bryant haliday devil doll thinks it's something to dedicate his and his assistants' pat hill mary peach and chris mitchell ronald allen lives to br br during an experiment before noted dutch scientist lembach gordon heinz his machine fails due to sabotage so he has himself projected by his secretary sheila tracey crisp to seek revenge of course she screws up and he comes out looking like a pork roast with the power to electrocute people br br with this new found power he manages to zap some cockney idiots a security guy named latham derrick de marney and his lab boss dr blanchard norman woodland he also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat as well br br in the end though despite hill and mitchell's attempt to help him the clown destroys his equipment and himself on the whole a completely pointless movie with no message at all br br also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see
<START> beside the fact that in all it's awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it's best paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it as usual a woman concieling her true intentions the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brother br br the scenes in 'wiking land' are just as i remember it from my early time travels to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection br br i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill br br odin
<START> i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one the hurt locker has won more best picture awards from the critic groups than any other film this year however not only did i not like it i found it hard to sit through br br there is minimal plot and little character development they disarm bombs fight and disarm more bombs that is the entire movie br br but the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking this has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary look to it the camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen br br i normally don't care for war movies and the hurt locker was no exception but you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it
<START> the film is about sir christopher strong mp member of parliament played by colin clive and his affair with the amelia earhart like character played by katherine hepburn up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn he couldn't help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the problem is that in the pre code days films glamorizing adultery were very common plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel and a really bad one at that sticky and with difficult to like characters after all clive's wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume you've gotta see it to believe it and she looks like one of the bugaloos an obscure but fitting reference
<START> this show is painful to watch br br it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers br br how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on abc family
