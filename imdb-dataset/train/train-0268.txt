<START> the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all br br the plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children br br the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real like lunatic could buy it don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy award nominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest br br in a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch
<START> i'm surprised this movie is rated so highly although if i were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd so now i've just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be waisted and that way my 2 1 2 hours or so has meant something
<START> what ends up killing this movie is its self consciousness among other things here's a short list 1 irreverent behavior when the beatles came over and injected their brand of quirky irreverent behavior humor it was greeted as fresh that was over 4 decades ago get over it br br 2 false sophistication spewing out base quasi socio political isms is hard ground to make work comically ask woody allen br br 3 the post modern i'm hard on this phony world and yes i recognize it in myself snake eating itself used as illustration with another animal in the film itself is such a retread br br 4 smarmy smug drollness br br 5 amateurish writing acting direction ever seen student films a victim of itself about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself and sheesh now i'm getting caught up in the self reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile of value br br but towards what ultimately it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece hey ever see woody allen's take on bergman ie interiors well this just does it more amateurishly
<START> in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set akimbo when the man takes to wearing an old red pants suit of his mother in law's br br i kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made or why the other reviewers found it funny for me it was a total waste of time br br not everyone's tastes are the same but this was clearly not to mine
<START> easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire but don't watch this movie expecting to be entertained ang lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the civil war what is beautiful about the movie like all of lee's films is that he doesn't side with his characters he creates characters embodies them with life problems and ambiguity and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable this film has action but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous i e like the characters it is real and as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars the violence is horrific br br but as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the civil war it is a masterpiece was the war about slavery and an abolitionism lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the blue and the grey neither is about idealism though as seen in gone with the wind it is about freedom about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it as you watch the characters you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery the fact is i don't think they really are and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the civil war br br the fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values the letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle jake and daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits and when the tension finally snaps and these characters find themselves suddenly free we see the birth of new men br br all this mixed in with lee's beautiful incorporation of humankind's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames lee has a style which is his somehow european in its art a slow camera unrushed asian in its epic ness and development of story and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in north americans br br relax let go of your preconceptions about what the civil war is what the western as a genre is what a war movie should be and let ang lee take you into a world so fragile so hard so real that few of us can comfortably see it br br in this lee continues what he wrought in ice storm again the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction a sure sign of lee's ability to direct without imposing himself on the story or screen his direction is amplified by what he brings out of jewel yes the singer a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance br br a movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard hollywood epic
<START> this is a good family show with a great cast of actors it's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too anyway clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character pete young a kind of likability and naivetÃ© that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role i really like kirsten storms as pete's sister betsy she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it it may take a few episodes to really find it's legs but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out people you'll be glad you did
<START> what the hell is this its one of the dumbest movies i've seen i don't understand why people on this site love it so much its senseless nudity for no reason its worst then resident evil i strongly don't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy bad acting crap watch real horor movies such as stephen king's it the shining jurassic park kinda horor jaws etc leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent it is bad as crudy vs gayson attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap br br oh wow flesh eating zombies how many damn zobie movies do we need skip this one br br outta
<START> what happened those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen nightmare on elm st had gone noticeably downhill after it's cult classic of a first film but i doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film and nobody is more distraught about it than i am br br this is by far the worst anoes film of the lot it doesn't seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring alice but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events i mean sure freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it's poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup it feels like you're coming down with a terrible headache not like you're getting scared so the directing totally fails none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that's crafted like a comic book battle that's why this movie gets a point br br the storyline lame lame lame lame it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad and nothing more br br the acting should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish boogey man like clown figure how his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old's horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and loathed since the first film that arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ugh and his one liners too throughout the whole movie they suck badly a grade schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film hell a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy's been told to say here who wrote the script for this this movie is really irritating too it seems so pointless like a gnat buzzing around your head a gnat that just won't go away freddy is just an annoyance now we've seen him so many times before this one's nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your tv screen alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was fitted with lisa wilcox may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can't save this movie the other actors just suck mostly br br the last 15 or 20 minutes of freddy's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing i hope englund was ashamed of this who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series i can't ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that krueger became he was slowly becoming a jokey retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low this is rock bottom nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film he's naught but a joke a clown that is long overdue for retirement pathetic br br of all the movies i could hate why did it have to be nightmare on elm st a series which i once adored and liked a lot the dream child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st series freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment freddy's dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason and finally he would putter out into nothing which is for the best br br i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made not recommended to anyone and even anoes completionists won't want to see this one again
<START> i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i can't believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
<START> a large part of the scenes should be cut off there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off for example the scene where the hunters mentions i got spiders on my dick i like dick playing in the mud scene or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer br br how about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women's panties three sizes too small while they make love didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head why did they do in a living room i mean his head really flipped how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielberg's jaws scene at grant lake all these strange scene could easily be re dubbed and billed as a comedy br br here in my local town the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about dinocroc and i am glad i didn't watch it because i later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled the movie was that bad i suspected that dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview it features the leg of dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old it could easily passed over as baby geniuses br br if any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash such as diane's boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer when this happens who cares about dinocroc the panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of dinocroc his acting was so bad he makes a much better replacement for mr bean move over rowan atkinson here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci fi flick perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood
<START> a young girl surviving as a prostitute br br a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score br br they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about eros and thanatos it's not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one we've seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions
<START> okay look i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i'm getting' pretty tired of it but i digress it's pretty simple it sucked i know rather juvenile but it did andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive distractingly so if i may add and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain grief over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the crawling on her back demon thingee was pretty neat
<START> contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk br br i loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leo's is in the foreground br br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub you can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepy br br the use of text in the film was unique like when leo's character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a film br br the use of black comedy in this film was well done ernst hugo jÃ¤regÃ¥rd is great as leo's uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about it br br the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo's head which at times is a scary place to be br br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed anti woman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters don't fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
<START> i didn't want this to get complicated leese i have to assume she's gonna read that fear takes flight at 30 000 feet in this taut action thriller an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa rachel mcadams realizes her seatmate cillian murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot as the minutes tick by she's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late br br one of the many reasons i love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars mcadams and murphy who are also two of my top favorite actors for example the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other i got to hand it to the two as well for making a film like this work especially murphy's character jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent yet he's trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally i mean in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa br br a great thrill ride all the way through a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about but actually i wouldn't mind a prequel to this one which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene because it was so unexpected there was also that nice buildup to the famous 'pen' scene when is she going to make her move there was also that nice change in mcadam's lisa where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court how great was murphy with his whole weezing
<START> hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school i think kids who enjoy non stop hip hop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy or something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and as a drama failed dismally we're supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was ramon he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me he's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with also these great kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun br br i could forgive all that if the music was good but i can't stand hip hop the songs were at best mediocre and they were nonstop they're always playing it got to the point that i was fast forwarding through the many endless music numbers cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie maybe there are a few imaginative numbers the subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show if you love hip hop here's your movie but it you're looking for good drama mixed in forget it also how did this get a pg rating there's an incredible amount of swearing in this
<START> i grew up watching full house as a child i stopped watching it for years but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well my kids can't believe that dj on the show and i are the same age br br i really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family it has good teachings your kids can learn from also there isn't any drugs and violence on it also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help that's the message kids should be getting from tv now a days turn to your family for help not to drugs kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days br br i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth it talks about real life problems and family matters there is always a lesson you can learn from the show br br i vote the show a 10
<START> just like everybody else have said the acting is awful no story or whatsoever poor directing about the sfx the 360 degree matrix style shooting 1 shoot is stupid enough but for each characters i mean come on gimme a break and what's up with all those video game scenes just to remind us it's a video game adaptation jesus they should have fired whoever think up this idea br br 0 00001 10
<START> at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children one can see toots is not in the best of health but he goes along when he dies suddenly may's world begins to spin out of control br br the film directed by roger michell based on a screen play by hanif kureshi is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now br br may's life as a suburban wife was probably boring obviously her sexual life was next to nothing we get to know she's had a short extra marital affair then nothing at all when may loses her husband she can't go back home so instead she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter's home it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren her daughter's occasional lover br br darren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes may who at the beginning of the film is dowdy suddenly starts dressing up becoming an interesting and attractive woman she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before br br having known a couple of cases similar to this story it came as no surprise to me to watch may's reaction her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce a widower ends up frustratingly for may who realizes how great her sex is with darren the younger man we figure is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may finally the daughter helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made br br the film is a triumph for the director in anne reid mr michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may also amazing is daniel craig he knows how darren will react to the situation anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helen's class and is quite effective br br the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind br br
<START> one of the best amitabh comeback movies i liked this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan the songs were awesome and totally as we call it masti type an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawan's potboilers with a timely appearance by mrs madhuri nene dixit it was a total riot towards the end it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile although some may consider it a typical bollywood masala movie i would watch it any day i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood
<START> i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening the plain white cover and title intrigued me i'm a relatively speaking old lady and my son is a young man of 30 i adore movies that are sheer entertainment such as the sixth sense interview with a vampire harry potter and beetlejuice my son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films such as those directed by bergman or hertzog we generally hate each other's movie choices however we both watched and loved the movie nothing it was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before we're both cynical critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u s it would have done very well indeed
