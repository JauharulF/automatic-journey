<START> the film is almost laughable with debbie reynolds and shelley winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers with the horrible notoriety after the trial the two women team up and leave n y for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple like girls br br from the beginning it becomes apparent that reynolds has made a mistake in taking winters with her to california winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker br br to make matters worse the women who live together are receiving menacing phone calls reynolds who puts on a blond wig is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students nicely played by dennis weaver br br agnes moorehead in one of her last films briefly is seen as sister alma who winters is a faithful listener of br br the film really belongs to shelley winters she is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better winters always did well in roles testing her nerves br br the ending is of the macabre and who can forget winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look
<START> brokedown palace is the story of two best friends alice and darlene who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage in this way the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as return to paradise but instead the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship br br claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interplay between them the suspicion the jealousy the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life which is a bit glossed over and focuses more on these friendship issues br br there were some plot holes here and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic we didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold in short this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it was br br but overall i enjoyed it the acting was good the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting worth seeing
<START> i really wanted to like this but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs br br the politics are spot on it's gonna offend the hell out of republicans but that's what it's designed to do that alone gives me reason to chuckle br br the problem is it looks like it was made in a real hurry like about a week and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer which seems to be completely off topic br br turiqistan is obviously iraq or afghanistan or any other number of countries the us has f ked with since the 50s the humour is a little dark amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation but it is on the mark especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction democracy lite br br however like a lot of satire criticising the us it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured i guess it's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point who knows i prefer more of a nudge wink approach a bit of subtlety but that's just me br br anyway i might watch it again perhaps i missed something br br i'm hoping w is more on the mark
<START> following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week i'd say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately especially the young couple with a baby having serious issues phenomenon is very familiar to me as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland the relationships and problems of people fragility of the marriage institution the drinking culture unemployment and the ascending money problem all are very well put without any subjectivity or exaggeration br br there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and captivate the viewer i happen to think in a calm moment what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street well this is what is happening movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects finland as it is and pretty damn well br br one comment about the acting being the fan of finnish cinema i am i've never seen any of these actors on any other movie but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew i'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast br br 7 5 10
<START> there is great detail in a bug's life everything is covered the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw dropping the film isn't too terribly orignal it's basically a modern take on kurosawa's seven samurai only with bugs i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut outs the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper the lead bad guy was a brillant creation check this one out
<START> after the success of the second instalment richard curtis and ben elton decided that blackadder should have a third appearance this time instead of tudor times or elizabethan times edmund blackadder bafta nominated rowan atkinson is living in the time of the french revolution accompanied by the now stupid but lovable baldrick tony robinson blackadder is the faithful butler to george the prince regent of wales hugh laurie throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful he tries electing a lord for a rotten borough tries to sell a book tries to win a bet about the scarlet pimpernel tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the prince this is a very good instalment to the popular comedy includes appearances from robbie coltrane tim mcinnerny miranda richardson and stephen fry it won the bafta for best comedy series and it was nominated for best design and best make up rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 24 on the comedians' comedian and he was number 8 on britain's favourite comedian edmund blackadder was number 3 on the 100 greatest tv characters and he was number 3 on the world's greatest comedy characters and blackadder all four series was number 2 on britain's best sitcom outstanding
<START> i like this film for several reasons i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi i also enjoy films like topkapi and big deal on madonna street that spoof the the genre one of the best ones is disorganized crime br br corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town but he hasn't given any details on the crime to the fellows nor do they really know each other at all shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen ed o'neill and daniel roebuck whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back while he is in their custody the four cons fred gwynne lou diamond philips ruben blades and will russ show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something br br the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from o'neill and roebuck again not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film the four cons trying to figure out what bernsen's scheme was and how to put it into operation and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of there is also a third smaller plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair br br there are many delightful moments in the film such as axton egged on by o'neil and roebuck into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of and yelling through a megaphone come out we have you surrounded only to have the scene switch to a huge montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment there are moments of misadventures by our four cons who fortunately put the oldest gwynne into leadership position this does not always guarantee anything at one point their car won't start and they have to thumb a ride by truck unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure br br the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery including disabling all the police cars at the critical time philips specialty is cars is also a gem of timing suspense and comic results the film is very entertaining and certainly worth watching
<START> i respect alex cox the filmmaker i really do he's like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be different a literary punk rocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringe culture and come out into the world ready to take s on but then you see what he can actually do the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer but there's two sides to his proverbial coin he can either really hit it out of the park repo man sid nancy walker arguably or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat straight to hell death and the compass falls into the latter category and while i respect its mostly original approach to tackling a detective killer story it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull br br it has a strange enough set up and already irreverent style to follow a detective erik lonnrot is after a killer with a hell fire voice red something and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims scrawled in blood on the walls are messages that according to eyewitness alonso zunz christopher eccleston looking as if he just walked off shallow grave without changing his look has religious significance in the kabbalah we follow lonnrot on his case and his methods of going after the perp which include following at first a triangular and then compass shaped pattern on the map this despite the protests of the flabbergasted commissioner treviranus miguel sandoval who also looks back in flash forwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case br br oh cox has his moments of creativity and interest such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where eccleston's character is taken in by handcuffs for his own protection says lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room and we're followed in a long tracking shot maybe the best or just most curious where we're taken through very dark hallways with very little direction lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters and it's never something that isn't fascinating to look at with miguel garzon's cinematography a morbid delight but the plot goes through hoola hoops to keep things so off beat it might as well be beat less all together the performances save for a confident boyle and for eccleston at the very end are pretty bad especially sandoval who just seems to squirm in his seat reciting the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audience br br while the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this isn't something we've seen before that it's in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting alphaville's next decrepit wave it too fizzle's out very quickly what's the conflict here i was never that much engaged with boyle's own personal mission to find this killer and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer and or killers going after people like in the building early on cox himself has an amusing cameo and just when i started to think it was leading up to something spectacular with boyle and eccleston in that big not as big as you think building in the south section of the city it suddenly gives us a twist that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isn't and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery it's been leading up to for all of cox's uncanny touches as a filmmaker for all of his opposition to spoon feeding the audience with a 'conventional' approach which i do respect death and the compass ultimately cuts one off at the brain stem it's masturbatory
<START> tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that tragedy is like another character in the film the same could be said and not withstanding bringing up tarantino for sidney lumet's best work in years a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved kelly masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount but her script does convey character before plot and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat it's bleak as hell unforgiving as satan but also absolutely riveting 90 of the time br br chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non linear script where we see the day to day actions of character to character before during and mostly after the botched 'mom pop' jewelry store robbery occurs but because of the formidable cast assembled which i might add is lumet's specialty philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f ups and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool proof heist looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in westchester hawke's hank involves another shady character though murders occur and suddenly it's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father played by a perfect albert finney it's the kind of material that most actors love characters who like in dog day afternoon are painfully human flawed to the bone but only wanting love or things to be set right and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs br br in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly hoffman has until the aforementioned last ten minutes a super calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally i e with finney or the car scene with tomei push his talents to the limit hawke meanwhile is called a loser by his ex wife and daughter can't pay any debts at all and is called a baby by his own father and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter he's not quite as flawed as his older brother but who wants to pick a straw for that title and finney as mentioned is spot on all the way through making his turn in big fish look like child's play the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half br br also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two timing marisa tomei bug's michael shannon as bad ass white trash and amy ryan brian f o'byrne and rosemary harris making brief exact impressions this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart but not a forgiving heart with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral if it's not as mind blowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumet's done since
<START> the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh well br br lets see how the next episode does
<START> i've now seen this one about 10 times so there must be something about it i like br br 50's us sci fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch they were either intelligently made and or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese forbidden planet is a bit of both but in that rarity for the genre colour br br it also had a head start with the script although shakespeare might not have recognised it it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well br br it's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200 000 years before along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it but always do that love triangle thing yuk disney's cartoonery still holds up well and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though br br all in all with all faults the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives
<START> this film is stale and misses the mark it is far off compared to the 89 batman that it tries to coppy that women singer whats her name can not act and we see why her film carrier died notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either my uncle and dad were expecting batman and the films impression is more like cop rock not worth renting 3 10
<START> like his early masterpiece the elephant man lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight simple story without losing his artistic touch this is a true story of an elderly retired man expertly played by richard farnsworth who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death's door a beautiful score from badalamenti exquisite photography of rural life love those aerial corn field shots and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity this is a beautiful slice of life film its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end
<START> this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when surprise she isn't what she appears to be the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying kidman is actualy rather good in this role making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting grade c
<START> also known as water lilies this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them br br using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well everyone is completely believable visual setting is great especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect br br many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them it pulls some standard pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them it isn't bad not at all but it surely isn't great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles br br 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
<START> well it's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but i'm a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change i'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end all in all a good movie with very good actors br br
<START> this is probably the best television show i've ever seen i first saw it on comedy central several years ago at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order and having just watched all three series in order and unedited thank you internet and your wondrous series of tubes i am so glad i rediscovered it i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a season and i tried to get friends and family to watch it but nobody really seemed to like it i need new friends so on my own i made the best out of it that i could even when i felt like it was waning a bit i still felt compelled to continue watching years after when i discovered little britain i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters also i love the idea of writers who act the entire show not new but done impeccably here lb has nothing on log no offense matt david love you this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius serial murder implied cannibalism you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful unique piece of tv art the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey you'll never leave i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs but each character as portrayed has it's own charm my least favorite was papa lazarous that was until he re surfaced in series three clever and wholly unexpected it's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before becomes so compelling while repulsing that you really can't stop watching this is not for those with weak stomachs kids conservatives or grandma unless you've got one saucy granny i have always loved british tv particularly comedies from monty python to benny hill red dwarf to keeping up appearances absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office but not their us counterparts sorry this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted nothing nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment us broadcast tv is so sad and lame i can barely stand to watch any of it it's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem your loss comedy central thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the across the pond that redeem the entire medium every decade or so basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently crossing lines with more graphic sexual content drug use and adult language but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life adult behavior instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up sheesh it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years don't even get me started on us sitcoms waste of time and lots of wasted money did you know that according to jim has been on the air for 10 years 10 years anyway watch this show get it on dvd do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well you've never seen anything like it there are three specials that i have not watched yet i'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits he'll watch them even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement lines and lines and lines and lines note that series three departs from one and two the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters the laugh track is gone thank bloody hell the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey don't be thrown by any of that as by the end the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable brilliant confident and absolutely demented you will want to re watch it again and again it's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close up facial expression if ever i were to meet any of the writer performers i'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it i'd just say can i help you at all then they'd probably slap me so i'd ask them to sign the slap mark 10 out of 10
<START> in texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears a serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were friday 13th then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating halloween from this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of c production however the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting with a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie my vote is four br br title brazil agonia agony
<START> reign over me is a success due to the powerful work by adam sandler and don cheadle while comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment he might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems however this performance has some considerable dramatic weight unlike his roles in less comedic fare like punch drunk love and spanglish br br in the film alan johnson cheadle runs into his old college roommate charlie finerman sandler whom he hasn't seen in several years five years before charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash charlie barely even recognizes cheadle's character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident it isn't until alan persists in engaging him in conversation that charlie remembers who he is their renewed relationship that follows will allow finerman to have a friend who doesn't speak about his loss eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own terms br br though writer director mike binder doesn't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer he shot this film with a digital camera as more and more filmmakers are doing today enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting this kept the colorful backgrounds of new york city in focus but resulted in creating frequent digital grain which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen br br almost every main character in reign over me gives a great performance jada pinkett smith and especially liv tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to cheadle's character and a psychiatrist however it is sandler and cheadle that give some of their finest work to date they completely owned this movie sandler actually plays a character that doesn't outwardly resemble or act like himself at all partially credited to his bob dylan esquire wig though cheadle's character has more screen time than sandler they both should be considered to be leading roles as they equally support and help each other throughout the film br br music also plays a great part in this film especially the title song reign over me or love reign o'er me by the who and later covered by pearl jam in one of the most powerful moments of the film binder shows sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger it incites his emotions all an all reign over me is an enjoyable sad yet many times funny film driven by its amazing leading performances
<START> that might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true just have a look at what he as done so far they barely make it past the 3 star mark br br why did i watch this movie 2 reasons lucy lawless and heroes star greg grunberg lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie i do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills greg was not so impressive typical tv acting style br br the movie is oddly categorized as a horror the only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2 5 seconds with a little blood in them i personally would call this more a drama thriller br br but no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting appart from lucy destroys it you get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one you just sit there watching feeling nothing its like watching a bad tv soap actually i think the tv soap would be more interesting br br my advice stay away from this movie or better yet just stay away from anything michael hurst is involved with
