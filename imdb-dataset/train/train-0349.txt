<START> the acting may be okay the more u watch this movie the more u wish you weren't this movie is so horrible that if i could get a hold of every copy i would burn them all and not look back this movie is terrible
<START> this movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting br br this is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany br br this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves br br if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look
<START> i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me after a few times i get bored and changed the channel i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others first robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland's character he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair in return culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career out of anger culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere i don't know maybe i just didn't care for this one at all of course columbo gets him in the end it's just the question of how
<START> frÃ¤ulein doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has declined in the past 40 years then in the late 60s while the big hollywood studios were on the ropes italy france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood's decline there were the james bond pictures doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 cent afternoon admission price the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor that never paid the italian producers a dime and french crime movies that usually went to art houses with exceptions like the sicilian clan and there were european co productions like doctor zhivago and of course frÃ¤ulein doktor with its big budget for the time and the world talent involved frÃ¤ulein doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later br br kenneth more playing a british intelligence officer has a line in frÃ¤ulein doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game the wall being opposite a firing squad with little chance of the spy winning the game that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders in the vietnam war era of 1969 br br the steamy scenes between suzy kendall and capucine probably did not damage these performers' chances at getting parts in hollywood movies hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses fox would no longer co produce films like the sicilian clan columbia wouldn't distribute films like belmondo's the night caller mgm went even further cutting almost all film production selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and unloading its borehamwood studio facilty as kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas where a bally casino gift shop sold mgm memorabilia at giveaway prices stuff left over from the auction of mgm's prop warehouses br br paramount distributed frÃ¤ulein doktor but gulf and western's charles bludhorn who had taken over the company and canned the studio's aged board of directors unloaded the studio's film library to universal as i recall and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another but that was in the 70s frÃ¤ulein doktor with its lesbian scene was buried with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s br br kenneth more was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older especially in the bbc detective series father brown when he was younger as in the british movie titanic he played his standard reserved british officer in frÃ¤ulein doktor he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual as i recall it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate about his role and of course those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle that was some scene and alberto lattuada showed he was some director helming this world war i espionage movie where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen
<START> nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready it's short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer br br when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend br br it's a live in situation once julia gets to the house she's drugged and when she wakes up she's told she's mrs hughes and not allowed to leave br br the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it
<START> this is simply the worst movie i've ever seen neither of the three central characters has any charm and erika's good looks aren't enough to carry the film the lamest plot i've ever had inflicted upon me also the most unconvincing military comedy ever why did they bother
<START> dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti christ is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jean claude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever they're on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i've seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it it's awful and it's the lowest point in lundgren's career and i saw cover up the last warrior and masters of the universe br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad but i made an exception for this one and i was very glad that i did br br it's filled to the brim with action much of it surprisingly graphically gory sleaze isolated to nudity with a key female character but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious and outrageously awkward dialogue all of which adds to the laughter inducing tone of the film br br ginty the unusual looking star of the exterminator and countless other low budget action turds is amusing in the lead giving the best performance he could muster williamson is better than usual clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee and he doesn't come in until midway through the rest of the cast is also fun to watch particularly the villains one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish mash of spanish and italian she's priceless br br again i can't stress enough how gory it was it's not so bloody that it's nauseating but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget also when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers br br don't miss white fire it's a rollicking if mind numbingly stupid action classic
<START> we toss around the term superstar way too lightly these days but here's one guy that truly deserves it br br i was glued to the set this entire show the song selection was perfect it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment with songs of this strength you don't need a circus to be entertained br br the shots of the crowd were amazing too how many performers can affect the original beatles fans now in their 50's and beyond get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of can't buy me love and impact everyone in between br br while watching i also realized that in the wake of john lennon's tragic death paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought paul not only lost john and george no matter what their final relations were it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennon's murder received i agree that lennon's murder was horrible but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath i was very happy that he's found love again in heather br br as for those complaining about the audio video quality i had no complaints whatsoever both were crystal clear on my set i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out they'll never be satisfied br br my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it br br when people remember john lennon they will first remember his murder and then his music i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney because if nothing else he will be remembered for his music first and let's hope another lunatic won't change this because the mccartney catalog is pretty good
<START> i had a vague idea of who bettie page was partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of playboy apparently when she got her photo taken of her and her santa hat just that she didn't know what the mag was the movie co written and directed by american psycho's mary harron fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in new york city where she gets into modeling and from there a lot more soon she becomes the underground pin up sensation with bondage the obvious and notorious of the title trait attributed to her the actress gretchen moll portrays her and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could which is really a lot of the success of the film she's not a simplistic character even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable well adam and eve were naked weren't they she comments a couple of times apparently the filmmakers leave out the later years of page's life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period leaving behind the photo shoots for jesus br br in all the notrious bettie page is not much more than a kind of usual bio pic presented by hbo films albeit this time with the stamina for a feature film release the best scenes that harron captures are page in her questionable positions getting photos of her in over the top poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms this adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature it's not that the story behind it is uninteresting which involves the government's investigation into the 'smut' that came out of such photos and underground magazines but there isn't much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at with page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties it's all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along it's a watchable view if you're not too knowledgeable of bette page and probably for fans too
<START> i saw this film yesterday i must admit it weren't my cup of tea although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind but as i was watching this i was thinking 'this movie isn't making any sense at all ' where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind where on earth did a shark came out from br br all these elements in this film somehow didn't add up i felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap br br i've seen many good horror movies in my time but this is one of the most worst horror flicks i've seen at the end of the movie i said to myself that i wouldn't watch it again so much pappy show in this film i've decided to give it the thumbs down count me out on this one 0 out of 10
<START> you better see this episode from the beginning because if you start to watch it any later you will be confused as to what is happening to clark's life br br yet that is the twist clark is stuck in an alternate reality lana is devoted to him lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss clark in the pilot of the series martha is married to lionel about the only constant is his most loyal friend chloe who still believes in who he is and oh yeah he doesn't have any superpowers he is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers and is ridiculed for believing so aside from chloe there is one mysterious figure who believes in clark a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution who believes he is from mars br br clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality and not get brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist who is in fact the fourth phantom zone escapee br br this episode is utterly mind blowing and shocking plus it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of smallville episode
<START> i haven't laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too especially when it changes from hyper funny to honest and serious the characters are very realistic most of the times sappy sometimes but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel sorry for the participating people this film instead is a satire and it is doing great br br too bad that all expletives were beeped out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it br br
<START> this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies aren't cheesy
<START> camille 2000 br br aspect ratio 2 35 1 panavision br br sound format mono br br whilst visiting rome an amorous nobleman nino castelnuovo falls in love with a beautiful young libertine daniele gaubert but their unlikely romance is opposed by castelnuovo's wealthy father massimo serato and fate deals a tragic blow br br a sexed up love story for the swinging sixties adapted from a literary source alexandre dumas' 'la dame aux camelias' by screenwriter michael deforrest and directed with freewheeling flair by radley metzger who along with the likes of russ meyer and joe sarno is credited with redefining the parameters of 'adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's using the scope format for the last time in his career metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess note the emphasis on reflective surfaces for example though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards production values are handsome throughout and the performances are engaging and humane castelnuovo and gaubert are particularly memorable despite weak post sync dubbing though set in an unspecified future enrico sabbatini's wacked out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period and piero piccioni's 'wah wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees ultimately camille 2000 is an acquired taste but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed next up for metzger was the lickerish quartet 1970 which many consider his best film
<START> thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo can't stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore why wasn't the song slop time by the sherrys used as the theme
<START> this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities perverted sex greed violence and intolerance all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through 1 10 for 'fun' 8 10 for displaying 'man' as he sometimes is
<START> i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood br br so the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now br br the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it's obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beast br br so the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues br br maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sub lunar space for the last 30 years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i dunno br br anyway that's the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it's hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characters br br two other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in 70s cinema i can guarantee you've never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting man's assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process it btw i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walk on in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot br br burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imm's director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here no one's idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here br br everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i ain't laughing but not much br br this definitely falls into the 'so bad you can't look away' category of cinema disasters still i'd watch it again before i'd watch a lot of other 70's and 80's abortions track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and mst's coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version
<START> i have never panned a film on line but i felt moved to do so after seeing this one one doesn't show up at someone's funeral and say to the bereaved my relatives died so why should i care about yours br br minus the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art as the daughter of deaf parents i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated not ignored it br br the word chutzpah comes to mind as a writer there are few subjects i would stay away from the holocaust is one this is another i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant and inept
<START> a new way to enjoy goldsworthy's work rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion watching goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work although i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy's pieces no snowballs i do feel it was a bit long the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy's work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch
