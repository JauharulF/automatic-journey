<START> i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes but 20 minutes in i was liberally applying the fast forward button far too many shots of stewart michael zelniker walking from room to room down hallways through doors and down the street and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short 20 30 minutes and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker they co wrote the screenplay br br it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before or if the ending wasn't disappointingly the one i had predicted three minutes into the film atypical for an independent smaller studio film at least its heart was in the right place it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense
<START> you have to see it to believe it directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield have done a thing really great it is a 10 out of 10 so i can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie with people love scenes and so on i am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet finally it has nothing to do with al gore's documentary movie an inconvenient truth mainly made of long monologues painfully and with truths not always accurate as many scientists have pointed already br br the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth
<START> this movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid the book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it toni collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scary br br the acting is pretty good and toni collette's performance was awesome as well as robin williams br br the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd
<START> some might scoff but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films this misses out on all fronts br br a bunch of young people women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t shirts naturally go to film blood surfing and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile br br not only was the croc obviously fake but some of the props notice the boat hitting the reef in particular look like they've come out of thunderbirds br br no good from start to finish don't see it
<START> the oddly named vera ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice skating blonde girlish always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material when i watch vera ellen's sexy apache dance with gene kelly in 'words and music' i can't help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american vera ellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in edinburgh a city not noted for its tap dancers 'let's be happy' and 'happy go lovely' br br in the latter cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh there's a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival which is nonsense the festival is not a showcase for splashy leg shows we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from a few highland accents there's absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romero's show is 'frolics to you' this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks won't br br vera ellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isn't required to convince us that he's interested in bedding the heroine br br the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals his wistful rendition of she's my lovely was a big hit in britain in 1937 here he shows up in several scenes as romero's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number nor even any real comedy it's absolutely criminal that this movie with a title containing the word 'lovely' sure to evoke howes's greatest hit would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do br br the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts whom i worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall as vera ellen's confidante somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go but doesn't match either val guest has a story credit but this movie doesn't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood's process work 'happy go lovely' is at utmost best a pleasant time waster with 'waster' being the operative word i'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10
<START> this movie is simply far too long far too repetitive with the male nudity and sexuality being as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles far too gratuitous and unnecessary much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience and stamina of an audience br br i saw this movie on an early saturday afternoon with a film festival audience the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome interested in more experimental or atypical films such as one without much dialog shorts foreign films the near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the pay off which never actually arrived i have never in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals experimental gay and otherwise seen such a large number of people walk away from a film br br this movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was it also could have gone in different directions still with a shorter running time and been far more effective br br as it currently exists this is not something that one can readily recommend or one i would have any desire to watch again
<START> the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me because alan dobie was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on it's a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldn't be so good i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho
<START> probably the worst film i've ever seen the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep the only good actor was colm meaney i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing
<START> scott henderson alan curtis is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone he's sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him br br this was made as a b film from universal look at the cast all character actors and one star franchot tone on the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s it's beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for cornell woolrich it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and there's the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy i'm surprised the censors didn't cut it br br there are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and he's just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves him he's so unemotional but raines is pretty good in the lead role she's pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true he's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated br br still i'm giving this a 9 a really great film flaws aside
<START> as a wwii naval history buff and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations i was looking forward to seeing this movie what a disappointing piece of schlock i made it about 3 4 of the way through but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene the idea that a u boat would fire a torpedo at a dde as if there was a hope of hitting it and then be able to run away from the dde while submerged is preposterous and that's just a small detail the whole movie was poorly written poorly directed and poorly acted i agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie it's as if they decided that since all those crappy wwii propaganda films were made with all white casts they needed to make one with black people and as bad as those old movies were this is actually worse and it almost smacks of false advertising to headline ossie davis and stephen rea it turns out they had very minor roles i have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film i'm done i've given way too much of my life this crap movie
<START> it is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a mass market hit any day while this really can't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the long delayed climax of leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late br br great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rear projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop br br the compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan scan format must have never seen it where is the dvd br br it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over rated un nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
<START> a detective dana andrews with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder craig stevens and then tries to cover it up the otto preminger directed film has plenty of atmosphere but the story gets watered down when the dead man's wife gene tierney falls for andrews he was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film gary merrill is great as scalese a crime boss that andrews is obsessed with bringing down and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive especially a scene in a bath house with merrill andrews and neville brand and the night time rendezvous outside of bellevue hospital that sets up what ought to have been the film's conclusion high marks for atmosphere andrews merrill etc and the general portrayal of the underworld though the love angle and the simplistic good cop bad cop elements don't help its cause
<START> i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film br br stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold br br this film was just a joy to watch it has something in it for everyone all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classic br br all the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia but the performance to talk about is robert de niro in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show br br if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced

<START> this film is terrible i was really looking forward to it as i thought lantana was great br br the following review may contain spoilers br br br br first the good things it looks great some of the performances are ok the bad things are everything else about it br br the story as you possibly know is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body with the twist that they find it on friday but continue fishing and finally report it on sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range however the film takes it's time boy does it take its time getting to this central event br br of the ensemble of characters about a dozen not one seems to like another one which is i suppose consistent because they are all unlikable i was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related and it was not until near the end of the movie that i could vaguely construct the family tree br br it's hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim which is a failure in the structure of the story as the character's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after once you've set the bar so high it's hard to up it short of everyone committing suicide br br there are silly lapses in logic the killer dumps the body in the lake and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains the fishermen walk out sunday morning but for some reason byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station um they haven't heard of the telephone down at the station the media know the whole story less than 24 hours after they reported the body br br totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body this is a mystery everyone asks them how could you do that and the audience is asking the same question the debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in deliverance i know exactly what i'd do in their situation someone needs to walk out to the car drive to mobile range call the cops wait and them guide them back to the location if the others wait at camp and fish who cares br br a lot of all this just seems false the only thing that rung true was that as the girl was black the local aboriginals seized on the fishermen's actions as racist wouldn't have done it if it was a white girl br br throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl i think the subject is mentioned once and there is no mystery as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene br br so i'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused when there's a twist not in the plot but the theme suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about black white reconciliation huh br br this is australian film at its finest according to the age
<START> a fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at doing something about them when the chance strikes nothing was easy for morris either he had a family job job opps elsewheres a mortgage etc it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play aaa ball for 4 months it took guts i am glad that they showed his indecision almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors br br i can remember seeing him pitch against the red sox i think it was a great story though morris actually looks more like john kruk or a mills watson than quaid that's okay br br quaid does a very good job playing the man the teacher coach and 'oldest rookie' as someone who is in the the same age group i certainly can id with his plight you're not quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid but it's getting there you have to do it sooner than lator br br believably told nicely edited paced acted good to see the familiar faces of the late royce applegate brian cox and rachel griffiths here br br good job all around glad to see it hit br br outta who woulda thought that the tampa devil rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on
<START> slow incomprehensible boring three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book this is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book the best part of the movie was the scenery excellent the worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances the editing is abrupt and patchy however despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script it was startling that although set in peru there was hardly a person of peruvian descent wandering about the set even in the flashback scenes depicting peru in the 17th century if you have any sense of history try to avoid this movie
<START> at one point violet lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because i'm bore phobic it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom br br have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you bet br br watching the detectives is a clichÃ© romantic comedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of set up we know that neil is pretty laid back guy who didn't really commit to anything and then violet enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say no br br as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely bullshit this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a nutjob after collaborating with many great directors recently danny boyle's sunshine and 28 days later ken loach's the wind that shakes the barley and neil jordan's breakfast on pluto to name a few it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop paul soter by all means he's not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet her acting is a mess i mean it's all over the place and so over the top tony montana would have been proud br br the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine br br bloodymonday rating 1 5 4
<START> ok i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a classic and a standard part of most people's childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 i must admit i really hated it br br we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words watership down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it to be honest i wish i hadn't bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don't like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull this film was possibly the slowest thing i've ever watched imagine a doped up snail in space and really didn't do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced br br i'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get gassed not because i'm a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh i'm so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimax br br if i were to praise it in any way i'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well meaning maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad too br br so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldn't watch it the whole way through or i'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isn't torque bad but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes so i've given it a 2 10 br br hope this helps
<START> i'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many reviewers rank it below the peter jackson trilogy a filmed novel is always interpretive in particular an animated film relies on the artist's vision and should be judged on its own terms speaking as a purist this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned br br in the jackson version tolkien's frodo is barely recognizable from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling constantly wavering manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet this is physically and metaphorically true you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths bakshi's version respects the original presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths go back and trouble me no more bakshi sustains frodo's character as tolkien conceived it we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties he does so with numerous characters since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion bakshi's film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson's version similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry furthering the idea of fellowship for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action br br tolkien's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes when frodo sings the merry old inn song minutes before stumbling into strider the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths frodo is dangerously exposed this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it br br the well documented budget time restrictions limit this film's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers as it is it's worth a look even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype
