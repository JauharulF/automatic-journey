<START> this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated judas if money was not the issue what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day why did pilate waffle it is a movie for the serious thinking christian fans of the passion of the christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted here of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self interest is at stake far more realistic and deeply unsettling the disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christ's wrist is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its self imposed limits it is after all the death not the life of christ ultimately a very rewarding one
<START> and it did it is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor irrelevance omen iv the awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the anti christ foretold by a religious prophecy haven't we seen this before wasn't it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release we've experienced the rise and fall of damien thorn if you're a horror enthusiast such as myself you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy children of the corn hellraiser phantasm the list goes on at this point in the game i'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are omen iv the awakening is just that too a shameless money making exercise br br this film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the omen lineup as unique and genuine as omen iv tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the skepticism of the people involved the decapitation death scene clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass even right down to the father's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable br br although it is common to star a b rated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the charts chock full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film the atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles in addition the epic score composed by goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio which really says something because rarely do i comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score until now br br all in all i'd call omen iv the awakening a failure in the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some don't if you're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as i am for completion purposes perhaps you could carve this title into it as well if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly
<START> well as goethe once said there really isn't any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people don't watch it it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i don't mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i don't see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandre's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre lÃ©aud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post '68 milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he's chosen to create for himself what i can't however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can't imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post '68 parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have
<START> richard attenborough who already given us magnific films as a chorus line and gandhi once more surprise us making a beautiful hymn to the nature indeed the vast and in that time unexplored territory of canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes picked up by the motion picture camera if the movie is really based on a true story once more becomes evidente that men of vision are in truth men that lives beyond their time with a historical perspective that only the time will give them reason the cinematography is magnificient such as the cast lead by pierce brosnan whose performance is due to attenborough's master hands a pleasing surprise is the appearance of annie galipeau in the role of archie's beloved movie that must appears in a list of those who really loves the nature
<START> the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action great
<START> sorry i don't have much time to write i am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath no conscience extraordinarily well i agree she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly i agree what a chilling and tremendous film i have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100 my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did
<START> i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasn't as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i don't remember one line from either of those movies i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in 2006 br br though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 and i'm glad he did other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1 which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as sg1 its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you don't watch this then you have no idea what you are missing
<START> it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark film students should take this as a lesson and a warning would be graduate has an idea he wants total control so he writes directs produces his cinematic masterpiece all by himself usually his concept is far beyond his budget usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with usually he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes usually he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget usually he ends up with a series of encounters we cannot do justice by calling them scenes that feel like they were written by a 12 year old and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare
<START> if you are having a bad day or bad week if you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles i don't think role models is that movie for you br br the film centers around danny paul rudd and wheeler seann william scott two juice promoters who go to schools promoting the product telling kids to stay off drugs and more juice but danny is having the worst week ever and crashes his company car with wheeler in the seat next to him his soon to be ex girlfriend beth elizabeth banks who is a lawyer manages to avoid getting them jail time by doing hours of community service volunteering at a big brother place called sturdy wings led by gayle jane lynch wheeler is assigned to ronnie bobb'e j thompson who is 10 years old and has a foul mouth like he's chris rock danny is assigned to augie mclovins christopher mintz plasse who likes to dress like a knight and fight like he is in medieval times but will this be good for danny and wheeler or will they be better off in jail br br okay i'm not gonna beat around the bush this movie was very unpleasant in many ways namely the ronnie character hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young was very shocking if he was a little bit older it would not have mater'd as much i mean what where his parents thinking when they sign'd him on to this elizabeth banks character is so unwatchable maybe i was supposed to feel bad for her character but i felt nothing because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies and jane lynch who's the worst of the worst she delivers the most overacting performance ever playing a former drug addict who acts like she still is on drugs listening to her give all that annoying dialog made me want to throw my head up against the wall seann william scott once again playing another stifler like character he should really try to separate himself and this film won't do it and the more scott tries to hard to be funny is what keeps him from being funny br br now paul rudd on the other hand i'm gonna separate from the others in the film cause he manages to deliver a solid performance although he does not get higher laughs but he is the most interesting character from the rest cause rudd does not overact and does not try so hard the scenes with him and mintz plasse are watchable but the rest of the film is so stupid it picks up at times but it becomes so predictable and uninteresting it is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new there all the same they take no chances role models is an example of that
<START> this 1974 naschy outing is directed by leon klimovsky and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between inquisition and sadomania sadly not br br this is a strictly pg affair with tame torture sequences no nudity and little edge at all naschy of whom i am a fan struts his stuff as gilles de lancre antiguo mariscal de la nacion sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before strictly therefore for naschy completest only
<START> man i must say when i saw the trailer i was excited futuristic soldiers taking on bad ass vampires led by genre vet michael ironside in space i mean i wasn't expecting high art but it looked like a potential b movie classic this was no doubt a tv pilot reedited some time later into a feature film after it wasn't picked up alright i'll start with the films few good points the action was competent for a lower budgeted film and the cgi and locations used were passable now onto the bad first off michael ironside was barley in this and his performance here well it was cheesy not in a good way but as i said he wasn't in it much anyways so i can't blame him one thing that was really stupid was the peta type group for vampires' no i'm not joking it's the dumbest most unbelievable thing i've seen in along time and it's taken seriously also this film commits one of the major b movie sins it teases a lesbian scene and doesn't deliver most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it doesn't have a regular ending even the main villains only come in towards the end if ever a movie needed to up the sleaze and gore factor it's vampire wars in closing i will say the main crew on the spaceship were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them and go on to bigger and better things they just had nothing to work with here
<START> surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top 100 films of all time br br if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al pacino's performance is as good as it gets
<START> the plot is tight the acting is flawless the directing script scenery casting are all well done i watch this movie frequently though i don't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much
<START> i watched this movie expecting what i got good sci fi cowboy stuff what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role br br imagine trying to act under these two restraints you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions howzat kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct taped in spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed russell pulls off an incredible characterization his robot becomes human in spite of the constraints great job br br as usual jason isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered connie nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous i'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her unfortunately gary busey's role was too small and limited br br much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a sci fi comic book feeling i don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses by the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction yes br br the sort of feeb who thinks that russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point
<START> the mother tells of a recently widowed mid 60's mother of two adult children reid who on the heels of her husband's death finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover the film dwells on the quietly passive mom her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover and the convolutions arising therefrom a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents the mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues b
<START> hooper is not funny not fasted paced not romantic and non informative there is no real drama you would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real no character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
<START> in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken reluctantly by melania she attracts the attentions of an american seymour who becomes obsessed with her paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright she has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own however we are in modern art house cinema territory so conventions like narrative structure lighting the subject so it can be seen camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care people began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and i don't think i've ever seen so many people walk out br br images are important to the director characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra red in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional br br on the whole almost entirely without merit br br
<START> emma woodhouse gwyneth paltrow shakespeare in love duets has nothing to do with herself but painting going with her friends on her chariot up and down saying hello to people in town and trying to match make everybody she knows i guess there were no movies no television in those days and the girls had nothing to do but gossip i wish she had read a little more i like gwyneth and think that she is a lovely young woman she is talented and in emma one has the privilege to hear gwyneth sing i am looking forward to seeing duets where she is suppose to sing she is brave to speak british english with all those native britons including emma thompson's sister miss bates sophie thompson four weddings and a funeral dancing at lughnasa mrs elton juliet stevenson truly madly deeply was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991 gwyneth is part of the american movie royalty being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow st elsewhere and tony award winner blythe danner the myth of fingerprints she will hopefully be around for a real long time lucky us i liked emma and also recommend it it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days favorite scenes emma singing and playing the piano i specially like it when she sings a duet favorite quotes mr knightley emma you didn't ask me to contribute a riddle emma your entire personality is a riddle mr knightley i thought you overqualified miss bates it left us speechless quite speechless i tell you and we have not stopped talking of it since
<START> i had several problems with the movie br br 1 the screenplay specifically kim basinger's voice over movies are not books they should show the action rather than have a voice over tell us what's happening occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script in fact it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over br br 2 i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carter's acting was pretty bad that's a significant failure for me in defining jessie's and thomas' characters with no connection between them it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex deprived if it had been properly done the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story br br 3 with the book i understood jessie's mid life crisis in the movie it seemed more like just plain boredom br br on the plus side i didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv though that thought did occur to me
<START> whilst reading through the comments left for this show i couldn't help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will the thing about kerching is that it's a children's show for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy forced and probably stupid i even found one person saying the sets were stupid but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine they didn't yeah it can be annoying the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair but as a kids show i rate it 10 10 compared to the stuff they air in its place today well lets just say i wish it'd be re aired dvd release anyone
