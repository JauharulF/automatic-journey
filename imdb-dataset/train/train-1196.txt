<START> ying a chinese girl who speaks czech invited us to screening of a czech movie with english subtitles in the department of visual and environmental studies ves it was the first time i saw samotÃ¡ 345 i loners 2000 and it was pretty good br br much like in many other czech movies the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult dirty life the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u s movies in the early 1990s their relationships are breaking up combining and recombining another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either also you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context that's a very realistic feature of the movie's psychological analysis br br ond 345 ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters nevertheless you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman hanka he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka's parents' house a house that he repeatedly burns br br meanwhile hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents she just decides by tossing up a coin to break up with petr who works in a private radio station hanka does not view her parents' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment but she is a very flexible figure as far as the type of her boyfriends go br br for a while hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs however the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents br br when hanka and petr break up it is organized by robert a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists robert who also provides jakub with marijuana is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression br br vesna a slavic word for spring who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid and you won't learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems br br petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job a job that he eventually loses he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka which is how ond 345 ej learns about the news that make him very happy br br finally ond 345 ej's wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage even after ond 345 ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond 345 ej can try to capture hanka again the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond 345 ej saves his life lenka also works for the travel agency as a translator and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents' dinner br br the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude given the actual size of the czech capital it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people but it is fun
<START> i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much too much some have said i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band i hope to call it 'the knobs' love me liz
<START> i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything br br the plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie infested forest during this crusade they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the hotd video game and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations one of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy br br to sum it all up there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade f
<START> stephen king is generally known for the morbid and that's fine but this story is too morbid some movies by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through here you just feel depressed the movie has a nice feel to it at first with the family moving to the country and creepy old fred gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery but this plot leads nowhere it starts with so much potential but by the end it loses the potential to be a good horror movie and becomes corny extremely stupid and ultimately depressing br br louis dale midkoff his wife rachel denise crosby their kids ellie and gage and their cat move to a new home in maine they are warned by the loony farmer neighbor jud fred gwyne about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed he bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone one day infant gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck and louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery when gage comes back to life he is changed and wants to murder br br with many of stephen king's works that don't translate well into films i blame the directors and screenwriters in this case mr king was the screenwriter but i'm going to blame him for his awful story by the end it's so pointless and though unfunny the premise is laughable a little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel and not only that but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case carry a body from the ground to the attic i know this isn't set in reality but seriously how stupid can this get the scene where louis injects his deceased now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad because the cat did not deserve this all it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it the scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable not unbearably sad but the whole situation is just awful to think of after being injected gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant but even worse the actual ending of them film involving louis burying someone else not going to give away who in the cemetery after gage kills them what did he expect why did mr king write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie it's depressing and pointless br br my rating out of 90 mins r for violence
<START> in the history of movies based on comic books mystery men is one of the most underrated ones this is no regular comic superhero movie it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well meaning wannabes which include mr furious played by ben stiller the bowler janeane garofalo the shoveller william h macy the blue rajah hank azariah and the spleen paul reubens mystery men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like superman or batman such as the pithy sayings and the questions about secret identities most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne but blue collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to i found mystery men to be visually stimulating and very funny even if it doesn't turn into a franchise it's still a joy to watch
<START> i rented i am curious yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 i also heard that at first it was seized by u s customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myself br br the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married men br br what kills me about i am curious yellow is that 40 years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno while my countrymen mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema even ingmar bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his films br br i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curious yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes no pun intended of swedish cinema but really this film doesn't have much of a plot
<START> this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo
<START> another cult strikes again this isn't a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly long pseudo scientific infomercial ramtha's school of enlightenment br br when any religion philosophy needs to hide behind an oz like screen of deceit i walk away thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a friend to have wasted precious resources on this new age lobotomizer would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that guidance to it's logical conclusion in other words walk drown or shut up as a movie it deserves a strong 1 on it's entertainment value especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history the photographer's roommate eeeeeek if you must see this film borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it
<START> never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet the title on the box said insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie they can surely be fun of course as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make up effects just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in blue monkey the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense following the always popular trend of big bug movies blue monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital the makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over sized critter all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant other than this there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from like i said don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay the first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an 80 year old blind and alcoholic lady but the second half when the entire hospital is put to quarantine is dreadfully boring it is also near the end that blue monkey begins to exaggeratedly rip off older and better films approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore blue monkey is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made fans of b cinema may recognize john vernon killer klowns from outer space curtains in the small and meaningless role of roger who's in charge of the clinic
<START> does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevators br br charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband's lawyer but again i don't recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him br br herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film
<START> fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho season one's 'deep throat' takes place near ellens air base also in southwest idaho i'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry mulder and scully have some good dialog always a plus ed meecham the zoo keeper reminds me of cranky old school teachers they must have liked children at one time you just can't imagine how just like he must have cared more for animals at one point i liked the concept of the episode but i felt it had some inconsistencies if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely why can't they put the animal back in the right place and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals i don't buy mulder's theory of a problem with the space time continuum as if he's an expert on that i also thought jayne atkinson's performance as willa ambrose was not well done besides those nitpicks i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna
<START> what in god's name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earth shattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn't much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earth shattering br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson's dead alive is gory think about it br br getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can't tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer br br i've seen only one film that was worse than this the chooper br br for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but you've been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you're here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas 1 10 br br updated 7 5 09 after a few more viewings of zombie '90 i've had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie '90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star
<START> this is a hard boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilder's double indemnity stanwyck plays lily powers the well worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel town she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers once her father dies in a distillery explosion she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank br br this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwyck's blazing work here with her dead eyed stare and amoral seduction methods it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality one of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh faced john wayne as of all things an accountant named jimmy mccoy the melodrama gets heavy handed toward the last third of the film with a murder suicide a hush hush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury a tacked on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen the film has curious touches like lily's bonding friendship with an african american woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality
<START> judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukor's film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again br br it never happened in it should happen to you i can't think of a blander title by the way holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role can't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up br br maybe if you're enamored of holliday you'll enjoy this otherwise i wouldn't bother br br grade c
<START> my left foot is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot the only limb in his body he had control over daniel day lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film which i'm not absolutely certain was deserved but is still noteworthy day lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch brenda fricker as brown's devoted mother also won an oscar for a believable and touching role my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot the film can be difficult to watch this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time however if you look beyond that you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties we can certainly do the same thing well made occasionally enjoyable but difficult to watch may not be for everyone but not bad at all br br out of
<START> my god was this the run lola run adaptation of persuasion it was horrible bad enough that the screenwriter and i use the term very loosely cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another often completely out of context and to rush the story along but anne elliott running from location to location in pursuit of wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination austen must be spinning in her grave no respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion and the actress that played mary horrors needless to say if the rest of the austen remakes are this bad they will be turning off a new generation of watchers br br if you want to see an impeccable version of this otherwise wonderful novel get the 1995 roger michell directed version starring amanda root whose expressions alone can speak volumes and ciaran hinds it is superb

<START> for some reason various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first james gregory lee kenyon enters a cave finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of tyranus when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead demonicus back to life this shot on digital full moon release is stupid senseless has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy however it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance whether bug eyed running around in cheap looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed oh well at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast
<START> what keeps us going or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping when there is the revelation we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale br br this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is br br the inquisitor is 5 5
