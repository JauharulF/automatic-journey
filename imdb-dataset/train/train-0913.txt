<START> warning spoilers a really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon it's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse br br a waste of time for the viewers as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on the gore is ludicrous at best and the acting is terrible perfect pairing for such a bad script br br
<START> pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by pecker a young photographer who takes pictures of real things no pretty models no gorgeous men just hard living this wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain there is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at pecker's mom's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars this just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have you might not always have taste yet again john waters sends you into a never ending spiral of laughter and raw reality you can have your mainstream hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities but give me a pecker or a hairspray another excellent john waters film over a titanic or a godzilla anyday
<START> ok i watch a lot of bad movies i pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs but this movie is one of the worst i have watched i like a good horror movie but one with a plot of and sense of movement the opening scenes seemed pretty good decent music and imagery then it goes down hill from there one of the main characters has a disability ringing in the ears called tinnitus now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret they made that too much of a focus of the movie so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been no need to keep bringing it up so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her well after seeing her sister over and over again as a zombie like ghost and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped the idiot didn't even believe he killed her so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun somehow she manages to get herself strangled so the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins and not one but two innocent people die br br good things about the movie imagery br br bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
<START> as of this writing john carpenter's 'halloween' is nearing it's 30th anniversary it has since spawned 7 sequels a remake a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies' lists it's always on there that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around 300 000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the big question here is how does the film hold up today and all i can say to that is fantastically br br pros a simple but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood an unforgettable and goosebump inducing score by director co writer john carpenter and alan howarth great cinematography stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain good performances from the then mostly unknown cast a good sense of humor michael myers is one scary evil guy a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you the pace is slow but steady and never drags unlike most other slasher films this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count br br cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then many of the goofs really stand out br br final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series i know that's not a popular opinion but it's really how i feel despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten no way no how br br my rating 5 5
<START> this film was a critical and box office fiasco back in 1957 it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play which flopped on broadway the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii they have 4 day's leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn't really pull it off tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant but had other commitments so suzy parker stepped in she had never acted before but was america's top photographic model at the time i think that she did a good job considering all the pressure that she was under grant's pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes did not really work the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant but the character had no substance at all
<START> i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest the presentation is very interesting well presented and the graphics are state of the art but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work hydrogen filled flying bladders they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful and then there's the ever present possibility of a catastrophic explosion i have no problem with fantasy just don't try to pass it off as fact some folks will always misunderstand all in all the film is entertaining but i constantly found myself saying oh brother what a load of if you want a fake documentary watch this is spinal tap instead or at the very least turn the sound off
<START> i have been watching this show since i was 14 and i've loved it ever since i love this show because it's just plain funny you will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when benny always has her last comments on george after every punchline about his fat giant head laughs i would laugh and i'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short love george lopez funny talented funny spectacular this is a cool funny family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it i did and if you haven't watched it yet i suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes i still enjoy the re runs still funny never wears off br br 9 10
<START> another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war this time we're told about the story of carol lovely played by dÃ©butant clara lago a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york it is such an initiating trip and soon she'll find about the injustices of the human race their stupid fights and conflicts their contradictions br br imanol uribe makes his best film since dÃ­as contados 1994 with such a sober pulse a beautiful photography and a nice script he tries not to take part in the conflict he just shows us some facts and let us decide ok the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple clara lago and juan josÃ© ballesta br br a well cared production br br my rate 7 10
<START> i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours the plot line was thin and confusing the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey it just made it even more difficult to watch one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience the best performances weren't anything to do with acting in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash
<START> it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version true hollow man is a remake of sorts of the invisible man but that's where the similarities end hollow man is an entertaining movie period if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place true some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable but hollow man manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who along with a team of collaborators discover the way to make animals invisible now his mission is to make them visible again when this team of young scientists working as you might guess for the pentagon think they have the formula for making animals visible again kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug after that of course things go wrong as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask so his collaborators know where he is feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin's character and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator elisabeth shue is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team he finally snaps the movie then turns into a hybrid of alien and a slasher flick but that's not saying it's a bad turn there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace the special effects are top notch a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven's films as we get to see some body reconstitution sequences never seen on a movie before if there's anything to complain about perhaps is the predictability of the situations herein by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end and the ending is a bit abrupt but despite this hollow man is still worth watching if you want to know what a truly bad movie is then waste your money on fear dot com with stephen dorf or the even worse the untold or sasquatsh with land henriksen now that is hollow 8 out of 10
<START> dull flatly directed comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it's not enough br br one of those scripts that if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion
<START> the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed ooooof her loins rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s kurt russell must have had a fun life
<START> although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it
<START> a bdsm sub culture of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess plainly a vanity piece for its top billed player celia xavier who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd roms but when disaster befalls mistress vanessa virtuous celia determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker begins a new job as a sex slave at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party two fbi field agents whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective are assigned to investigate the crime while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her flaws in logic and continuity abound such as a homicide being allocated to l a p d 's operations south bureau a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post production editing and sound reproduction the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario one solid acting turn appears among this slag stan abe as a zealous fbi agent
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical first off there's no plot the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends also the zombies were terrible no where near as fun as any of romero's work who gets s plug in the movie and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies also all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun and the way the people die is so stupid it's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open so dumb br br final verdict if any of these actors appear in another film then they've been blessed with a second chance definitely the worst film i've seen in years a b movie on cinemax is better
<START> i had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes and that is exactly what i was br br of course it is campy of course some of the dialog wasn't perfect of course the special effects were a bit hokey that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70's horror classic br br the talent needs to start some where that goes for the actors and the crew and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than this br br i for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors
<START> anemic comedy drama an unhappy seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit man who's been hired to kill her by her husband chazz palminteri as the talkative hired gun adapted the screenplay from his own play with stagy set ups and back and forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear an air of gloom hangs over the entire project and director paul mazursky can't get cher out of her perpetual funk she's listless despite all the top talent including robert de niro as one of the producers faithful is fraudulent with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life 1 2 from
<START> this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just don't think she did a very good job bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie they are going by train to davis's relatives house davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest but when they arrive home their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself
<START> i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good i do not like family films i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor the director's last movie mpkdh was complete stupidity and the music was very boring and bland but there was amrita rao who has become my favorite after main hoon na there was also seema biswas alok nath and anupam kher who are very talented so a few plus points br br i finally saw the movie and i was very impressed he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding and we have a winner the story outline is similar to hahk light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end the director also made character that you could relate to the thing i did not like about hahk was that the characters were too eccentric the casting adds to its perfection shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance this is a major improvement and most importantly he suits the role the best is easily amrita rao in fact this is her best performance her screen presence is so electrifying you are bound to love her performance sameer soni amrutha prakash anupam kher alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast not one actor feels out of place br br the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching the songs aren't colorful and dancey and they are more like ballads the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk so what was the flaw in the movie the movie gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched but the movie is still goes at a good pace making it a perfect family film
<START> i know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original however sometimes spin offs can stand on their own merits i like the new iron chef because it is similar enough to the japanese version but at the same time caters to american spirit i love alton brown as commentator because he explains things with flair the iron chefs themselves are very interesting i know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time but bobby flay is the only american iron chef to beat them mario batali seems to have the most fun when cooking making comments and being flashy while creating i have watched the series and find all the players work together well the judges are not always the best choices however there are a few exceptions like the lawyer turned foodie but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served i enjoy watching the chefs hustle and the challengers are surprising the food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen perhaps that is all anyone can ask to want to really eat what is served the only thing i would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense and that isn't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement i liked the version with william shatner iron chef usa because it was so over the top like the original but i can tell it was a pretty expensive proposition i wish he had stayed with this version and been the host between bill shatner and alton brown that would have me grinning for an hour as long as you don't expect the original japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits you may find it to be an enjoyable hour
