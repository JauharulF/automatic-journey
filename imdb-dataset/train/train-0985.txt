<START> victor nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema by poetry i mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play there is something very literary about the film almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen in this sense the film achieves depths many cannot but it is also rather slow at other times undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui the film's star ashley judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here she fits the role of lead ruby like a glove almost as if she didn't have to act she has true movie star presence in the film and hasn't really managed to convey the same allure in her later films although she was impressive in normal life
<START> tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plant's accidental release of toxic waste br br unrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior rather horrible obviously intended to be mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up craft was far down troma's list of objectives for this gory sleazefest the honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits the german teacher who becomes a member through a toxic kiss has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the creeps the toxic monster which dispatched the annoying punks towards the end is pretty cool though br br kind of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly
<START> ashanti is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa it's a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lot br br david michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while they're doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her back br br michael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel br br then there's lots of adventure there's also lots of morality questioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but it's all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it
<START> i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2 3 years thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart through tng ds9 voyager etc general popular consensus will say i like the next generation the best that's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation but to be quiet honest i appreciate the creativity of voyager's episodes more than tng voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager's doctor now that's creativity instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best endgame portray him as a husband married to an organic inventing neuro implant transceiver for human machine interface and even in the episode before endgame to disobey captain's order and make human mistakes unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality of course the rest of the voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless harry kim and tom paris very natural i love tuvoc occasional humor despite being a vulcan finally i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain oh if you get to watch the rare footage thank god for kate she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain what a great job thank you star trek for making voyager i enjoy every episode the creative exploration of possibilities of morals and of our cosmic expanse
<START> i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it one otherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign movies roberto the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable however the children in the movie are mostly 3 4 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life
<START> wow 5 more hours of riget lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soap opera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off complete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesn't last for better or worse this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didn't involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on extremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger grander more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and it's been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it playing a very difficult character anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didn't speak he was later dubbed and still handing in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very hand held with rapid zooms and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound though these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i don't regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it's even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece helmer's solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more low brow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first mini series one would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easily a certain character living in denmark for no apparent reason for example anyone who's seen it knows who i'm speaking of the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first though if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from i urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i can't tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 8 10
<START> overrated and only for those people in their 20's whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young awful animation dialogue and a tired narrative a real product of the 80's the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy thats right toy not the absurd pretentious and child alienating collectors action figurine sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia only matters to those who bought the toy when they were actual children in the period of '84' to '87' it has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories avoid
<START> sure it takes place in the west but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western instead it is a movie of a woman sheriff make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down she is only a tad bit upset by this her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman but the villain hires a guy to kill her so this is what happens the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa utterly stupid as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars but i guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb this movie is very boring and not really worth watching it is not one of the better episodes of mst3000 they made i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful corman is a low budget director but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another
<START> manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences the worst one is the lack of closet space some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full br br melvin frank and norman panama a great comedy writing team from that era saw the potential in eric hodgins novel whose hero jim blandings can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel and two daughters must share br br jim blandings a madison ave executive has had it when he sees an ad for connecticut living he decides to take a look obviously a first time owner jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent this is only the beginning of his problems br br whatever could be wrong goes wrong the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house after the original one is razed as one problem leads to another more money is necessary and whatever was going to be the original cost ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford br br the film is fun because of the three principals in it cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings myrna loy was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr grant the third character bill cole an old boyfriend of myrna turned lawyer for the blandings is suave and debonair the way melvin douglas portrayed him one of the blandings girls joan is played by sharyn moffett who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint the great louise beavers plays gussie but doesn't have much to do br br the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better the direction of h c potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies
<START> hey now yours truly theatrex found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market in almost new condition and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a cult hit so of course it came home with me br br what a strange film the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on long island suffolk co and share the house with raccoons cats fleas eyow and who knows what else suffolk co was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right anyway this is one strange pair big edie and little edie edie the daughter always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense big edie the mother age 79 apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that these women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense except to them they live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever look that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations if i close my eyes and listen to big edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested the box refers to these two women as eccentric and i'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them this is equal parts creepy sad and disgusting but i couldn't stop watching once i started this is not my normal type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating it won't be for everybody though guaranteed
<START> zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's shintaro katsu own production company this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series though it is by no means weak overall it tells of our hero coming across two towns rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy violence and no little interest all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks it is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff the helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor its a harsh world with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting though things aren't as rousing as they could be shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi mixing wisdom deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability while solid work comes also from rentarÃ´ mikuni and an effectively baleful kÃ´ nishimura later to appear as katsu's superior snake magobei in the hanzo trilogy as the two main bosses in the film there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be emotional impact is lost also the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments still i enjoyed this one it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment a good story and decent doses of zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool recommended for fans of the series and a reasonable entry point classy stuff though not a true great
<START> way back in 1955 the british made a comedy called simon and laura with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall to this day it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and more particularly about how television sitcoms become so popular it was and is an excellent example also of self referential cinema br br so also soapdish a film i'd never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well as you know br br however i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv in fact it's been a while since i laughed so heartily so if you like satire i'd recommend you see it br br the main actors Â sally field kevin kline robert downey and cathy moriarty Â quite simply do an excellent job revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is as i watched it i kept thinking to myself just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life that is if actors ever do have a real life as you probably know peter sellers for example was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters so that nobody really knew the real person so as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch br br is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter lori played by elizabeth shue and in an emotional moment repeats the fictional lines she'd used on a prior episode of her daytime soap when confronting her fictional daughter in that show are you confused well it's not all like that but the dialog is stunning for originality comedy bitchiness anger depravity duplicity and even love br br the story well there are many stories in this film all interwoven and which all come together at the end of course Â but not like a robert altman film okay and not all of them are resolved finally life's not like that anyway right the pace is almost frenetic and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it you won't regret the time usage br br the rest of the cast all perform well although i've never taken much to whoopi goldberg perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others she gets my vote as the outstanding player i kid you not she gives the term bitch an entirely new face
<START> as much as i love rodney dangerfield this was a terrible movie the plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes in addition it was annoying and boring and that's being kind if you're looking for a good laugh rent a copy of private parts
<START> this is one of the most irritating nonsensical movies i've ever had the misfortune to sit through every time it started to look like it might be getting good out come more sepia tone flashbacks followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary the main character maddox is a manipulative would be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility the supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting but are unfortunately never developed nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to commit the acts of rebellion at one point i thought aha maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton now we're getting somewhere but of course that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless both from maddox's perspective and the viewer's where's ferris bueller when we need him
<START> i just recently watched this on the sundance channel the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers illustrious in their own country to make short films eleven of them all in one film concentrating on just one subject september 11 br br from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film br br the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september 11 which they fail to realize until later br br the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the t v plays br br the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9 11 but bombings in other places br br the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september 11 and believes they must march for them br br the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladin br br the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day br br the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks br br there are other films that i can't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful it will bring back your emotions from that day br br 10 10
<START> excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years starting around 1910 he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood his family friends romances etc very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale all things in life come together as one and a river runs through it and that river haunts me worth seeing
<START> i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web i thought cinderella 2 as well as 3 is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and adults like me i am 22 years old br br i also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart i thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by brooke allison too since this film has been divided into three flashbacks stories my favorite out of the three is the story of when jaq the mouse became a human for a day thanks to fairy godmother and her magic
<START> what else can you say about this movie except that it's plain awful tina louise and adam west are the reasons why to see this but that's it but their talents are wasted in this junk i think that they used a double in some of adam's scenes like when he's running because you can't see his face if adam was embarrassed in being in zombie nightmare just think what he must've felt about appearing in this if it was before or after i'm not sure but still zombie nightmare is a classic check out the mystery science theater 3000 version first and last compared to this the gang is very annoying and over acting by some of the actors a rip off of the wild one starring marlon brando of course tina looks stunning though i hope her and adam got a good paycheck pass
<START> i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you haven't read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might entice you to read the book which you'll probably enjoy more br br
<START> if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book please don't give up on the series i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year and already i'm almost finished with book 10 i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice while left behind the movie only vaguely follows the story of the left behind the book the characters aren't even close to accurate br br a few examples rayford never acts on his feelings for hattie he is about to when he's informed of the vanishings buck williams is a blonde haired magazine writer not a tv reporter chloe is at stanford and a lot of the book details rayford wondering if she 'survived' buck and chloe don't meet until much later at a meeting in new york set up by hattie irene and raymie are never 'in the book ' rather just in rayford's flashback thoughts the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that rayford and hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs etc etc etc br br and that's just from the first movie they're about to release the third please even if you didn't like the movies give the book series a chance
