<START> last night i finished re watching jane eyre 1983 the bbc mini series adapted from charlotte bronte's gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton my favorite james bond as mr edward rochester and zelah clarke as jane eyre a poor orphaned 18 year old girl a governess at mr rochester's estate thornfield jane eyre has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11 years old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words this book is amazing and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it its beautiful language refined fragrant and surprisingly fresh the dialogs and above all two main characters and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers jane eyre has been adapted to tv and big screen many times 18 according to imdb the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg george c scott and susannah york ciarÃ¡n hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society laws religion by the differences in age backgrounds experiences and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years of all these films i've only seen one 300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class he was mr rochester sardonic vibrant the force of nature powerful passionate sexy and tormented master of thornfield zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet gentle intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but firm willpower br br added on september 17 2007 during the last two weeks i've seen five jane eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience there is something to admire in every adaptation of jane eyre even if not all of them are completely successful this version is still my favorite jane eyre film
<START> what more can i say the acting was almost without exception amateurish the directing and continuity were pitiful the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious one of the features on the dvd was labeled gag reel but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie br br one of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the dvd he said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded with delusions like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did br br perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit per the 'making of' feature on the dvd and rather looked it the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game
<START> beautiful to watch but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis explore it here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special instead disney reverted to the same old formula story telling
<START> scott is right the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good however the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies japanese movies excel example being the lone wolf and cub series even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most the sheer intensity of those moments made them better but this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene if you haven't seen it you have to john woo is the man
<START> fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby boomers who grew up in the late 50's and 60's three of the adult actors actress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugar babe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but i'm not sure how there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself if still alive either 1 requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia like the rest of us they seemed to have vanished therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together br br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done they made no bones about it it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing as i'm sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speak out and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time br br dodgerdude
<START> while it was filmed at a florida national guard site tigerland totally reminded me of fort polk la firing ranges maneuver areas waist deep water and all the movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my ait in 1974 the difference between the tigerland year 1971 and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back to vietnam as it was pretty much all over so training was very relaxed not a challenge at all that was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s which i know for a fact as i stayed in until 2004 i never heard anyone mention tigerland but the army did have realistic vietnam training villages at different bases across the u s vietnam vets tell me that up to 1972 basic ait could be pretty rough and rugged because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train vietnam bound men those skills to make it although that was not always the case both a drill sergeant at polk and later one of my vietnam vet ncos when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at fort bliss told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves this movie rates high
<START> maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun Â check isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen Â check tasty looking love interest Â check assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents Â check german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion Â check corny one liners Â check br br deary me does this film take the wee wee or what the clichÃ©s come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is br br in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid we have all the usual action move clichÃ©'s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off br br jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point br br in amidst this mess there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects br br looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels i have got to find these gems on dvd it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel well goodness knows one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third instalment br br still blind purchases of cheap dvd's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep trotting out material of this awful quality
<START> despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle br br peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama the film has some good moments as beckett the veteran marine takes a newly arrived man recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country the only problem miller has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve br br miller the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men learns a valuable lesson from beckett what looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle br br tom berenger is an actor who doesn't register much as he proves in this movie but in the context of the movie he is right as a man of a few words billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end br br for lovers of action film sniper offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie
<START> the show's echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used to put me to sleep a very soothing show i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs florida i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge of the seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads i thought 'flipper' had better undersea action of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment
<START> 'succubus' the edited version of 'necronomicon getrÃ¤umte sÃ¼nden' is a struggle to sit through even at a lean 76 minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma br br jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever apparently this is one of the better of his 180 films Â it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there br br the unfathomable plot deals with franco's usual themes of sex violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s m for good measure and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious br br i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again Â life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this
<START> i only lasted 15mins before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear br br to say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard just to keep these comments clean br br one to be avoided br br
<START> no strings attached is one of carlos mencia's best performances to date mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues however he does more than that in this stand up performance which took place in san francisco in general mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today br br in this hour long performance mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace terrorism his opinion of mel gibson's passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke br br carlos mencia is not afraid to offend which at many times gets him trouble with his critics for example he does go somewhat far and he admits it with a joke regarding pope john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now br br mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans br br if you enjoy this performance i definitely recommend watching mind of mencia his show on comedy central
<START> one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle tom hulce was amazing with out words could convey his feelings thoughts i actually sent mike ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed it is good system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff i was in the audience in seattle with hulce and director a writer i think and mike ferrell they talked for about an hour afterwords not really a dry eye in the house why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know actually i do know it is our fault look what we watch well you get what you pay for guys get this and see it with someone special it is a gem
<START> this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie though i would rather watch the original japanese version americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother a beautiful woman named matel who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero or really bad he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending there would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here
<START> let me first say i watched this movie around midnight and usually there only is trash around this hour but this movie broke the record br br first of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy yet he gets to f ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop talks to a girl and then you see them f ck br br secondly there are loads of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can f ck br br thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
<START> this is a terrible movie terrible script bad direction and nonsensical ending also bad performances except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here and michael pollard watching this movie was purgatory you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line br br the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role you can see the plot points a mile away the actions of the female lead and that of her brother the cop also make no sense so a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script wise
<START> i was lucky enough to see zero day last night it's an amazing movie a very disturbing one at that br br in a way zero day is very comparable to the blair witch project it's shot completley with handheld camcorders it's about 2 kids just your average kids andre and calvin they start a campaign against there high school entitled army of 2 br br the whole story is told in video diary form from the 2 kids it shows there relationships with there parents amongst other people showing that these are just normal kids just like people we know or who have bumped into we find out the army of 2's last mission will be entitles zero day they plan to shoot up there high school br br you see how they get access to there guns how they plan it out everything they stress that the media has not affected them at all and there is no reason for doing this like i said this is all told in video diary form and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after zero day br br the actual shooting is shown through survillence cameras throughout the school chilling indeed the movie is very chilling some of the things they say how they plan it out you'd just have to see it for yourself one quote that i remember is the only time calvin is byhimself he says andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car doing this to numerous schools across the country i don't know what he's thinking but the only way i'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag br br i'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film you really need to see it yourself it's going around festivals right now br br a
<START> after the superfriends and scooby doo left the saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986 i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in and since neither the real ghostbusters nor the flintstone kids seemed very promising to me i retired and started sleeping in on saturday mornings i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show br br a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up i was 17 and in high school at the time but so what i loved this show from what i can recall this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of superman's 50th birthday that particular year it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard donner christopher reeve superman movies i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team galactic guardians series by hanna barbera a few years before sadly danny dark was not back as superman but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version after hearing him as reed richards mr fantastic on the 90's fantastic four i could still see this version of superman in my mind ginny mcswain as lois lane lol what a rhyme she was a voice director for hanna barbera and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast jimmy olsen is mark taylor who on the superfriends was formerly firestorm perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross who on superfriends was gorilla grodd and brainiac in the super powers shows and lex luthor now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than superfriends voice alum michael bell whom i know best as zan and the riddler as well as many other characters on many other series br br i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john byrne re envision of superman with lex luthor as a billionaire tycoon jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman the bruce timm series and lois and clark would also do this unfortunately we never saw brainiac bizarro toyman metallo or darkseid other than luthor we saw only the prankster and we did see general zod i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman who was voiced over by bj ward who played her on the super powers team as well br br the episodes were smashing and i also enjoyed clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment superman's family album br br the only two things i didn't like it only lasted one season and after wonder woman's guest spot i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess i also hoped for it because on the prankster episode the metropolis baseball team was pitted against the gotham goliaths br br every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare for spiderman i feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends for the incredible hulk it's the 1982 cartoon for the fantastic four it's the 1978 series with herbie the robot for batman it's the new adventures of batman 1977 by filmation featuring batmite but for superman the rarest series is this one br br superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release all in all this 1988 version of superman is well super

<START> this movie is just too funny a totally non pc gangster romp if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the 30's it would probably look like this too many great one liners to to remember and while its not for everyone anyone who doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse so put it on and laugh you iceholes
