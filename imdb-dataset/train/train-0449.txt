<START> anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast script and director can put together a comedy masterpiece by the same token it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood bore a thon this movie was pathetic had it not been for john cleese a comic genius i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid br br neil simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version he said that he couldn't improve on the first and i'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor br br jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny i don't know but one thing i do know it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular
<START> having read the novel before seeing this film i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte's work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial this is such an injustice to bronte's novel you are given no impression of jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her and his arrogance which attracts jane to him br br despite to poor scripting i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely namely mrs fairfax and grace poole however overall the production was poor given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful see jane eyre 1970 with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production
<START> i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie it's not bad enough to be hilarious there's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity although there was plenty of opportunity there's no gore there's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music that last part was actually funny on many occasions you see these natives hitting congas and 'jembÃ©s' and that's indeed what you hear badly synchronized on the soundtrack but they also added this funky bass line on the soundtrack so where was the bass player at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists why all of the sudden it's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river alligator god i actually missed the explanation for that one but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water it's all silly and pointless this movie also features the skinniest afro american model i've ever seen br br at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives the only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer crocodile is actually an alligator crocodile or alligator what's the difference it's big it's made out of plastic and it eats people all the same to me the alligator is a rather silly creation it's very stiff motionless and doesn't even flap its feet when it swims the eyes don't even move when they're shot in close up i guess they didn't know 'animatronics' back then in italy during 1979 there's also a lot of pointless inter cut shots of the local wildlife i suspect it's stock footage br br like i said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn't want to wake the sweet thing but the last half hour of the movie did get better we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them the most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses we're looking at a matchbox version of the van falling in the river here funny but nicely shot in fact there are several other nice traveling camera moves surprisingly for this type of flick i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but i don't wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie my advice is to stay away from it if you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see lewis teague's alligator i admit that one isn't italian and isn't a jaws rip off but it certainly is more fun and if you're interested in other movies made by director sergio martino then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019 after the fall of new york that one's an over the top rip off of every possible existing post apocalyptic future of doom movie italians and rip offs two words that go together very well
<START> i've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting considering medical facts that can be learned but this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone even during office hours which is ridiculously unrealistic there doesn't seem to be one solid lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show everyone is broken up and on the prowl hardly a true reflection of all americans indeed there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome br br then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice for instance in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid br br and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro lifers addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion you're a freak hardly the popular sentiment in the us two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression what's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in the script could have been written by planned parenthood br br all in all this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far fetched medical situations throughout the whole show
<START> this so called documentary tries to tell that usa faked the moon landing year right br br all those who have actually studied the case knows different br br first of all there is definitely proof when the astronauts was on the moon they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon for geological studies these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs who tested them and they all concluded that they came from the same planet not earth because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth but similar to those calculated to be on the moon i e the conspiracy theorists never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest br br another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing i e the flag moves there is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand so it moved and what proves this well if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be i e the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists they cant study a subject properly or only studies it until they have what they came for so that they can make a lie from that and make a profit i e this so called documentary br br a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources the artificial lighting from the studio once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong as usual the same would happen in an earth desert at night with no light sources but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck convention is held over br br the conspiracy theorists are in denial big time they only see what they want to see so they make up all these lies to seem important that is a fact
<START> i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that's exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee robin williams intends to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but ex teammate reno hightower kurt russell isn't just going to go along with it so easily br br granted it's not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least check it out
<START> chalk this one up in the win column this was a superb movie the acting performances were great and the script was equally great br br helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky gina was a complex character she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer br br jeff fahey the ray liotta look alike did a bang up job as the confused often stammering police officer that had an affair with gina he was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra marital affair br br steven weber most notably from the sitcom wings did a nice job as the quiet meek underachieving sociopath on the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys br br the entire movie was spectacular each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little
<START> last christmas i was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it i was somewhat wary of approaching the bourne ultimatum but i really shouldn't have been worried the electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series br br jason bourne matt damon returns after an apparent leak about operation blackbriar a new program based on the old treadstone project to the journalist simon ross paddy considine at the guardian determined to uncover more about his half remembered past bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director noah vosen david strathairn believe that bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good br br personally i felt slightly disappointed with the bourne supremacy as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic bourne identity it seemed more like a slow burning spy novel rather than an action thriller no such worries here every car crash punch kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed performances throughout are nearly faultless even julia styles begins to offer something more than book wormy eye candy the only real downer is that this like the other bourne films has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die hard ludlum fan this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre br br nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears the bourne ultimtum is a cracking movie filled with enough bone crunching action to satisfy the meat heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute even at the final reel you're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not and if not what more do you want this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty odd years of movie history in order to start again bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until casino royale gave the bond series the reboot it desperately needed missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition go and get yourself a copy of the dvd not the ultimate bourne collection though limited edition i'm afraid
<START> i really don't want to compare martin scorsese's cape fear to the classic 1962 cape fear film but i can't help it not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film cady taking the keys out of the ignition dog dying and even using bernard herrmann's score throughout the entire film he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can't help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene when comparing scorsese's version of cape fear to the classic version the remake comes out destroyed by the classic but even when taking the film by itself it's still bad br br now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick didn't just remake the 1962 cape fear scene for scene they tried to do things differently unfortunately this is one of the film's problems gone is the original crazy and animal like max cady who is out for personal revenge the max cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to save sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side his words not mine also gone is the stand up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film the sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy magoo distrustful and very unlikable even mrs bowden is a completely different character she's crazier than max cady is the overall story has also been changed around sam didn't testify against cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version sam is now cady's ex lawyer who cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him br br the overall story has been changed and i don't hold too much against it but the overall script is also weak all around other sub plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture they are also just poorly written the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have but they have some help in this department as well br br now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety however scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear giving the film a cookie cutter early 1990s look no sense of danger no suspenseful scenes and little style unless you count animating fire and the skyline style yeah there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe br br if all that wasn't enough the acting isn't great either robert de niro being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance starts off alright as max cady but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs bowden going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end as sam bowden nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film beige juliette lewis who also reeled in an academy award nomination is decent enough in her role as danielle bowden but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her br br this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes and i can't figure out why i wanted to like it i really did i mean if there's going to be a remake of cape fear i'd rather like that one too but i just couldn't containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear i found martin scorsese's cape fear to be a very bad film indeed the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles go figure
<START> this has to be one the best movies about serial killers that i've ever seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved silence of the lambs hbo has hit the jackpot here this film is compelling from the first moment until the last br br this film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about it chronicles the decade long search for the russian serial killer andrea chikatilo stephen rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him both of their performances are subtle masterpieces rea begins naive and unwilling to compromise while sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation towards the end rea becomes more world weary and beaten by the system while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic br br in any other movie i would have said that sutherland's performance stands out above the rest but here even it is rivaled by jeffrey dumann as the serial killer himself dumann brilliantly creates a character here who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find he is a monster but he doesn't want to be and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are he is tortured ashamed but vicious as well br br if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter and it is very disturbing then you should see this movie
<START> i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear i completely disagree i'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there i thought the casting was perfect i thought this was one of ed harris's best performances what an evil psychopath i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie i was riveted throughout this movie if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it
<START> okay this wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting etc etc well that's my presumption anyway br br at any rate the movie kind of bored me i've watched a lot of really long movies but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on basically because i just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters i just kept thinking who cares i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained i understand that this was the 1800s and all but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events br br the romance in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than i'm a guy and you're a girl which i don't consider much of a romance and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love oh well i guess it's the whole all this horror around us we have each other to cling to type thing or whatever i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl but that was just sort of dropped maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle i don't know br br oh well daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked and sue lee was all right i didn't exactly dislike jake but he seemed a bit too spineless i guess jack bull i did not care for at all and i'm pretty sure you're supposed to hate just about everyone else with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right it was pretty graphic and had that whole the horrors of war thing down but i've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme done better i enjoyed the patriot a lot for instance even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative but as i've already stated i'm a cynic what can i say
<START> the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it br br in every other way this film is a very lame rip off of jaws lake placid and alligator with a little bit of godzilla 1998 thrown in br br as is standard for a 1990's style horror movie the two non starring females each take their clothes off at least once the female lead doesn't since she obviously has a better agent br br the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark infested waters in this film a giant salt water crocodile also happens to be in the area people get eaten the movie ends br br i don't mind a bad horror movie but i really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is
<START> a may day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating hitler's visit to rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between antoniette sophia loren married to fascist john vernon and gabriel marcello mastroianni she's a boring housewife with several sons and he's a unhappy solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists she's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences the film is set on the historic meeting fuher hitler and duce mussolini along with others authorities as count ciano and king victor manuel iii describing the events by a radio voice in off which sometimes is irritating br br it's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility an unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing of course ruggero macarri and ettore scola's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting elaborate and sentimental colorful and atmospheric cinematography by pascualino de santis emotive musical score by armando trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif the film won deservedly golden globes 1978 to best foreign film br br director scola's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi theatrical for example Â¨le balÂ¨ 1982 uses a french dance hall to illustrate the changes in society 2 Â¨nuit of varennes 1983 a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as thomas paine luis xvi and marie antoinette who fled from revolutionary paris 3 Â¨the familyÂ¨ 1987 all take place in the family's grand old roman flat and of course 4 Â¨una giornata particulareÂ¨ or Â¨a special dayÂ¨ where loren and mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof
<START> this is the best of shelley duvall's high quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick's prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although i'm not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martin's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the show's flow br br as is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much
<START> we all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office right well this neil simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office sometimes it's just not worth going know what i mean and sometimes it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before in 1970 with jack lemmon and sandy dennis and much better also br br it's not that steve martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec quite to the contrary on both counts and it's not that goldie hawn is equally inept either her work has been consistently good if not great ever since i first saw her in tv's rowan and martin's laugh in of the 1960s br br the problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all it's really about new york and why everybody should come to new york to live and love their lives away in married bliss Â sort of Â in the greatest city in the world that's if you're a new yorker br br look the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment this 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess for example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo relatively long also from rudy giuliani then mayor of new york as we all know what Â giuliani bucking for president even then worse Â a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of new york br br and then we have john cleese reprising his role as basil fawlty Â but this time as a prancing cross dresser also Â once again browbeating hotel staff sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role and in the process doing great damage to the memory of fawlty towers arguably the best british comedy series bar none br br why was this 1999 movie made in the 1970s new york was a dying city in many ways it was almost literally bankrupt so when made in 1970 that was the city you saw grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke as it was then polluted and all by 1999 things had gotten better glitz was back new york was thriving it was the big apple ready for you to bite into if you had the moxie br br so naturally the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the american dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged as much as i like steve martin and goldie hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great jack lemmon if you've seen the latter then definitely don't bother with this one
<START> evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it
<START> the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleisher's favorite enemies arabs and germans to make us believe that very arab looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both trades are were run by locals and involve d much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer it's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish director br br the acting is above average especially by peter ustinov suleiman and kabir bedi malik michael caine dr linderby is good as always
<START> this film is to the f b i 's history as knott's berry farm is to the old west shamelessly sanitized version of the federal bureau of investigation fight against crime hoover's heavy hand did he have any other kind shows throughout with teevee quality script reading actors cheesy sets cheap sound effects and lighting 101 with jimmy stewart at 20 of dramatic capacity vera miles chewing the scenery the film features every c lister known in the mid fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor from the 'amazon jungle' to the 'back yard barbecue' everything reeks of sound stages and back lots even the gunshots are canned and familiar i imagine mervyn leroy got drunk every night except for a few very few interesting exterior establishing shots nothing here of note beyond a curio
<START> i really felt cheated after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos it ends suddenly and you know there's going to be another episode next week it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didn't know the rest of the story they wanted to make a dahmer 2 after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods all of a sudden i hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail how about showing how he got there how about showing dahmer's trial how about showing some more detail i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place i actually found myself saying in disbelief that's it that's the end i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made to the filmmakers i'd like to say if you're going to do it do it right
