<START> dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree but in this movie hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield once i got into the plot of the movie i was hooked but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film br br the concept of the film is great not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt br br that's about all that is good you can say about the film although hopper did try to act like a tough experienced street smart cop i can't help but feel his acting was below par and there wasn't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case the directing was also terrible it didn't have the feel of a true film but rather a tv movie production this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion the acting was weak predictable and terribly unexciting that's when i knew that 1st of all the action is going to be atrocious br br the angling of the camera was amateurish and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer's little sister had no true distinctive effect if it was supposed to be scary it wasn't everyone's acting was terrible and even for hopper i didn't feel for his character and i just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter br br the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team once i saw the swat team in action i was thinking finally something good but i was wrong 1st of all the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys that is just impossible 2nd of all apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun these 4 idiots would've been blown to bits because they weren't even aiming at anything or paying close attention they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward but it just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around 3rd swat team members do not yell out commands such as keep your eyes open watch out for yourselves are we good to go etc in reality they use hand signals or have radios but they're literally yelling at each other how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you're coming and to top it all off these guys have no plan apparently they're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase eventually they end up doing nothing that was the last straw i'm no expert on special forces but basically what i've just outlined is pretty common sense when the audience knows the movie is terrible the action pretty much becomes the life saver of the movie when you can't even make an effort to make the action great the movie is lost br br i give 2 stars for the concept but the rest cannot be credited if you want to watch a crime thriller don't bother with this one there's plenty of crime in the movie but it has the lack of thrill
<START> sure it's a 50's drive in special but don't let that fool you in my little book there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor catch the redoubtable mrs porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place she not only steals the scene but darn near the whole movie and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color a wise decision since the blob would not show up well in b w yes the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate but except for several of the teens the non hollywood cast performs well then too the byplay among hot rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage apparently they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with juvenile delinquents then again the 27 year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department but manages the hot rodder attitude anyway the movie was a hit at the time helped along no doubt by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play and except for the unfortunate final effects the movie is still a lot of fun drive in or no drive in meanwhile i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into shall we say refrigerator water
<START> why does this movie fall well below standards ultimately the answer lies in the poor humourless script a slim average looking travolta looking rather dapper in black i must say even with a huge mullet and gross both act very well as two young ish 'slick dressed' but nevertheless dimwitted new yorkers eager to open their own nightclub other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch it is so dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband to be travolta is one of the film's few pleasures charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling kgb honcho bob smith personally i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to 'indian springs nebraska' which is in the former soviet union you'll understand if you see the movie apparently this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release i guess paramount stalled on releasing the movie until january 1989 because of the unbelievable plot it was reported they deemed it unreleasable nevertheless this 6 000 000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing 163 000 in revenue as it was released only briefly in places like texas and colorado before heading straight to video this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie
<START> rival reporters pat morgan ginger rogers and ted rand lyle talbot are always trying to out scoop each other on stories the latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment the two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br this said to be follow up to the thirteenth guest has little to do with the earlier movie it is not a sequel as has been inferred ms rogers continues to develop her skills mr talbot adds a little humor to his characterization they are a pleasant team the plot is interesting and mysterious but the resulting film is very dull the opening and closing are startling a long winded wrap up of plot development points follows the climax br br a shriek in the night 1933 albert ray ginger rogers lyle talbot harvey clark
<START> super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break i've beaten the game 4 times but i've never gotten all 120 stars i've gotten 111 but i hope to achieve them eventually even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in i loved watching my sisters play it now i am 13 and still play this erasing games and starting over again br br the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game the gameplay is addictive the controls are great the levels are tough but not impossible the bowser fights are challenging br br i would like to tell you more but why don't you just get it for yourself put the x box 360 ps3 and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing wonderful game
<START> this is my favorite of the older tom jerry cartoons from the early 40's the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom jerry spotlight collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one aren't all madcap avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone who's ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him the nine lives gag is well done here and i don't know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when tom's owner is awakened by the ruckus mammy was not the maid it was her house she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready it's worth it
<START> this stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring ingrid bergman that i've seen even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that's nearly impossible to sit through without fast forwarding a lot of it br br only for die hard bergman fans others are very likely to fall asleep i suggest you to watch for whom the bell tolls instead
<START> this movie is light funny and beautifully filmed the lightning is absolutely superb and the colours convincingly remind vermeer paintings br br this is sentimental comedy at its best way above us and french standards and arguably better than english ones too br br every character is touching and interpretation is close to perfection isabelle blais is splendid sylvie moreau is better than in the catherine series stÃ©phane gagnon is charming emmanuel bilodeau is great in that weird role of his and geneviÃ¨ve laroche is the perfect best friend br br i could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie so give it a chance and add your own review
<START> such great actors such a disappointment marlon brando plays and awful character the movie is not funny at all a subconscious message can be seen it is a damn crap it suucks so badly throw your tv through window and so on it is simply disgusting and irksome in addition to foolish plot sense of humor there is something else the way the rooms are decorated the colors it makes me sick everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy usually i do not care about the decoration in movie but this from free money made me angry avoid at all costs free money probably for charlie sheen sutherland and brando but a viewer gets nothing one watches it at cost of sanity
<START> and that's why historic biographic movies are so important to all of us moreover when they are so well done like this one br br before i saw the young victoria i knew a few things about queen victoria but in the end i got much more knowledge about it br br emily blunt is simply great as victoria who would guess that and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscar's personally i'm cheering for her br br for technical issues i am pleased to say that is a very successful production with wonderful art direction set decoration and of course like it was expected to be a terrific periodic costume design br br the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen but foremost incredible woman and mother br br bravo 9 out of 10
<START> i remember watching american gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller which is gary cole i don't watch much tv but i watched american gothic i purchased the complete series on dvd this week it's still as good as ever this is one of the best tv series ever the reason i don't watch much tv is because it's just rubbish that's on except for derren brown it's all reality tv or soaps such as grease big brother etc i'm fed up with it i got the complete series of american gothic for Â£16 97 form the asda website that's the cheapest i can find it
<START> saw this late one night on cable at the time i didn't know that the girl billed as shannon wilsey was actually porn star savannah but she was so beautiful and got naked so often thank god that i actually sat through this brain rotting drivel i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy more than the next guy actually but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's writers' and special effects people's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace savannah before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen is really interesting to watch she's drop dead gorgeous bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times glances off camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time which is more than can be said for the audience for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked it still can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid badly made and annoying movie if you know someone who has it on video or if it comes on cable some night check it out but don't waste your money on a rental
<START> i only hope that no classicists ancient historians saw cleopatra or if they did that they took it as a laugh the movie is horrendously inaccurate more laughably even than gladiator which is at least a well written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story most blatant is octavius caesar's heir in the senate before caesar's assassination at the ripe old age of 19 br br besides this the acting is mediocre timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says caesar julius caesar billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh who in real life was not good looking at all but comes off as unbelievable br br so this is a warning for all historians this movie is not true to life
<START> some unrealistic movie spoilers included br br from real life experiences this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning i'm currently deployed on my second tour to iraq as an infantry man this film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences from the very start to name a few the bomb cart the eod elements rolling out solo with no escorts the eod staff sergeant sneaking of vbc having sleeves rolled the entire time in acus to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy the sniper scene the list would continue however it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect and the point was made br br this movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military br br people with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy
<START> things to come movie review by kwrice br br here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place it is a film i've only seen in truncated parts but art should be taken as a whole i experienced this film as it was designed in a darkened theatre on a silver screen with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with that audience and myself were effected by this film one woman who lived through ww ii was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive albeit corny ending br br the things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits the first thing we see is h g wells in bold angular block copy much like the superman of yore it is not the film title but the creator's title and then before any other humans such as actors or production are listed the director william cameron menzies is up there who you've probably seen his work before around the world in 80 days pride of the yankees and gone with the wind he did not direct after this sci fi epic opera he and mr wells created but his film imagery sets and design are very recognizable br br that imagery is very effecting i recognized images from many other films that have paid homage to this classic the recent hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is obvious along with bugs bunny fantasia monty python and the holy grail sky captain the world of tomorrow night of the living dead and more that i know of but which titles escape me this is real special effects here scenes now done with cgi are done with actors big sets and detailed models this film was made in 1936 and it's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs wells and menzies also worked with bliss doing the music and korda the producer to create a masterpiece with message warning and sermon br br the lines the shakespearean actors cedric hardwicke ralph richardson and raymond massey speak sometimes sound preachy but i also heard lines i still hear now these toys children have nowadays are nothing like i had when i was child it'll help develop their coordination what do we need books for what do we need to read for we don't need cars there's nowhere to go we have all we need right here there will be no war but war there is the naive citizens of everytown refuse to see the literal writing on the wall the never ending war explodes christmas eve the little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me this is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to hitler's appeasement this war does not end the poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act br br it is another dark age no government no services and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about plague warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists loved ones are shot in the street before they can carry the plague to another midway there is a marvelous vignette about the rolls royce that is a much needed respite mid way into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future br br that future is the third act the world has rebuilt itself with the help of that puny animal man helicopters fly in this film before they were even invented the plumber's helper has other uses than the dalek's or glenn miller's wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses and orators inciting the people to tear it all down beware the concussion you have been warned the city father warns the riotous populace so be warned this film might hit you like it hit me there are some cute miscues and miscalculations but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again and i do want to see this artful film again others criticize mr wells vision it is very easy to work with 20 20 hindsight regarding things costumes and foley miscues i believe mr wells' things to come is not about things but is actually about concepts social trends and philosophical ideals besides we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come this is not cheap cardboard british science fiction but worthwhile epic filmed opera sans singing that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings
<START> ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected he did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department from the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in he acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job he was quite clearly the best character in the movie br br this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner there are so many ways his character moses ashford could have taken a more pivotal role that he didn't was disappointing and a true let down i was hoping to see more from him in this film br br timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past being an action movie it has its share of shoot em up scenes blood and guts these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot out br br what irked me most was the way timberlake's character behaved during shoot out scenes he starts out having guns and not using them then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun and 30 seconds later without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me br br if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then you'll probably love this movie personally it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic make me believe that the story is true this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied
<START> everyone involved and the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been what happened the south american story what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut outs up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance and or movie he was either disinterested which i can hardly believe or dreadfully miscast i have also liked and defended richard gere and been vilified for it but here he had no power he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast if you can't find the candidate watch wag the dog again or even bulworth
<START> this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this anyway br br unless you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called ramone fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one
<START> i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything batman tas may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet it's just too damn good was batman beyond good yeah but it was no tas is justice league good it's not too bad but it's no tas br br the batman is certainly no tas either but i won't hold that against it it would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with it br br the concept of a younger less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice but all of the rest of the time the art is worthless americanime and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself it is paced written and designed like an americanime if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures i'd watch jackie chan adventures or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect the joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight batman when he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines if they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely and it's not that re imaginings are a bad thing don't get me wrong tas there i go again took mr freeze from your standard icegun wielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character of course freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade but the point stands what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and lore and takes a large smelly dump on them guess what they were eating corn br br it's obvious this show can't stand against tas but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me the plots aren't good and they don't develop any better they've been written for the demographic of children under twelve should children be able to enjoy a show of course they should this shouldn't be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages this show misses that mark br br is this show a tas no of course not the problem is it's not even a jlu
<START> maybe some people may consider this a slow movie however it's precisely this slow burning that allows it to profoundly affect the viewer like that marvelous first scene first we can hear the voices then we are allowed to see the characters finally the camera slowly pans back and to the side and we see another character a young man who is just sitting there apparently not even listening to the conversation or at least not really caring the fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the movie's strategy allowing the character to develop and be determined by the environment surrounding him but without remarking the points more than necessary people come and go flow in and out of his life although most of the movie follows him and most of the supporting characters are only seen when close to him defined according to the relationship maintained with him we are induced to believe that we are being objective so subtle is the director touch
