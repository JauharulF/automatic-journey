<START> terrfic film with a slightyly slow start give it a chance to start cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an antidote to the hbo hollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name
<START> i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more a little soft on the crime front it's almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming will be watching again for sure br br i'm hoping that they'll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around the actress who plays the assistant waitress also from bewitched i think is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nicely dorky and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very nice br br check it out
<START> i loved october sky the thing i loved most had to be the music it worked two ways in the first hour of the film it gives the viewer a time frame this is done by playing songs from the late fifties in the second hour an instrumental score takes over the music now fits the mood of the film perfectly br br i did not only enjoy the music i also quite enjoyed the cast jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me he gave off a first class performance as did chris owen quentin and chris cooper john hickam br br i've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself
<START> honestly i can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence life is simply too short what i will say is that alone in the dark succeeds in only three things 1 it will make you laugh but for all the wrong reasons 2 it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them br br and br br 3 it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film making br br doctor boll if that is indeed what you are i'm thinking proctology here what on earth are you doing in a director's chair
<START> izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor he definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world br br it's a pity more americans won't see this stand up routine due to its pal only availability
<START> i don't know why but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day there are great moments and it is always nice to listen to darth vader oops james earl jones speak but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film it has been sanitized for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi sic and this movie is certainly not it
<START> one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like it's the case with this movie the wedding date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the guise of a new story something that should have been let alone if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the stars br br alas that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to london when basically this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix then there is the problem with the stars debra messing and dermot mulrooney they have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar br br since the kat and nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be it's clear that kat will fall for nick and vice versa in this predictable story amy adams who was the best asset in junebug comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her br br for anyone interested the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes
<START> it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring a lot of stories are not self contained if you compare to f e coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure br br annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences br br well i think that's it
<START> brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours the pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits or in what i'm guessing the reason for the unrated moniker a few fleeting bare breasts the film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable tv movie if you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation
<START> dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can't act in this film he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories never tweak with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had spunk and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he's an actual fish next time you see him he's all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess
<START> i wasn't alive in the 60's so i can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience there are some excellent performances most notably by josh hamilton of with honors jerry o'connell sliders who play brothers divided by the war bill smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite all in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience
<START> december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richly produced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feel well special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtext br br so when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids 6 and 8 pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movie br br unfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worse than normal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie don't get me wrong those shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre off color zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfied br br we picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman
<START> i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen i'm embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was there's a reason they put these types of films on late night tv because they're utter rubbish avoid at all costs
<START> this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w sarno it features plenty of soft core sex really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well made marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies a must see for fans of sexploitation
<START> perhaps one of the most overrated so called horror classics ever made halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtis br br however its rewatchability factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness culmination to the actual events br br this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all br br how it spawned so many sequels i will never comprehend br br thank god rob zombie is remaking this and generally i hate remakes br br surely he will more than compensate for all the random time filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks br br this is a movie we feel we have to like much like the way we're taught that we should enjoy dickens br br don't assume this is a classic
<START> stephen king movies are a funny thing with me i either really love them or i loathe them some of the fancier productions such as desperation and storm of the century i didn't enjoy some of the smaller ones i really loved sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly br br the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary they are sleepwalkers shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town lay out traps to catch and kill the animals when they move to their latest town they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one he actually falls for her but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength the story revolves around what will happen with the girl will charles spare her or use her to save his mother br br although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters the acting isn't the best nor are the special effects however somehow the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption br br for uk readers this production has most recently been shown on bbc1 sci fi and sky thriller horror channels
<START> i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue by the way i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes br br the film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours reds yellows etc which makes it look quite unique the cast are also quite good the prudish bunny packard and the devil possessed delores salk are a stand out br br the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other 'lampoon' series
<START> yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichÃ©d dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it's a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare
<START> martin weisz who directed the solid rohtenburg will be taking the heat with wes craven for another shabby the hills have eyes 2 the memory of the legendary original which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake in name only a bunch of national guardsmen and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants one by one the weekend soldiers are picked off that's it there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene but there is precious little else to get excited about the film's heroes are the usual bunch of clichÃ©s and the mutants a far cry from craven's original family mostly resemble brian thompson from cobra coupled with some creatures stan winston had left over from the wrong turn shoot much of the action takes place in caves ala the descent and is well shot by sam mccurdy a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like leatherface in hooper's original chainsaw weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle but he's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations not a fan unfortunately
<START> possibly not but it is awful even the fantastic cast cant save it ok i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house bill murray turned from being a quick witted humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny its like he was trying too hard to be funny his character stole a weapon an rv come on and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers for a laugh one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are albeit unintentionally i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released
