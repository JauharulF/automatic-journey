<START> lately they have been trying to hock this film late night on cable tv commercials don't believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the 3rd worst movie of all time just behind mac me 1 worst and jack frost 2 worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy i'm not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs enthusiastically down
<START> this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i can't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say already br br the only other thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and he's the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air it's always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick i'm getting really really tired of stuff like this
<START> after reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so so i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth i agree with most on the point that if it hadn't been for lauren lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster filmed in mariette oh just north of dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down i 77 years ago at least as far as a tank of gas would allow i did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion this wee tale by the brothers crook is like an old record with a skip in it as an american i understand the difficulties ind film artists have to face a trip to romania would have wiped out the budget for sure lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of claire in the gas station claire on the side of the road claire under the bleachers claire in the house claire in the cornfield claire at school claire here and claire there it almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast josh and jeff have to make a living but don't write a two page script and turn it into an hour twenty flick before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of ghost whisperer or something and get a little background all of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film also there is an appearance by co director jeff as he is in all his films just like alfred hitchcock eh one thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on lauren lewis' derriÃ¨re well with all sarcasm now satisfied i still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career i hope and that chris ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching
<START> this zippy and fun short from 1916 the time when charlie chaplin and fatty arbuckle were the big names in comedy features the young oliver hardy as a ne'er do well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit br br of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick br br restored well it can be viewed as part of 'the early films of oliver hardy' and is now available on dvd a fine addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo
<START> i couldn't wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldn't wait for it to end all of the white actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said say it like this then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen it was so annoying we all know how will ferrell really talks and he doesn't stumble over his words like mr allen the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan and this movie definitely has not converted me i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen
<START> freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy gang caper stoner film and feel good british movie br br it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre stars phil daniels gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way this small film also has a great heart it is not just for bike fans as it bases around the character's relationships with each other including dreams and regrets such as gary stretch's fred longing for the family he left behind the cinematography is also great a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country towns br br stylish slick fantastic soundtrack likable characters and funny storyline i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat
<START> i first saw enchanted april about five years ago i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas it's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you can't help but root them on as they plan this get away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen it' pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it except when you're crying happy tears
<START> prominent attorney walter pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono wins an acquittal and discovers that his client keefe braselle was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city panged by his own complicity he undertakes an investigation stumbles onto the identity of the unknown man who heads the syndicate and murders him br br the ironies engage when braselle is charged with this second murder and pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another unknown man himself though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of american municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years
<START> another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko's marvellous 1950 thriller where danger loves this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum faith domergue and claude rains crisply photographed in black white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow where danger lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood's past see my full review br br unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension poorly written allen rivkin and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist blandly played by richard baseheart and his overtly floozy wife a risible audrey totter is totally implausible and unconvincing how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates lloyd gough our timid pharmacist instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan another bland performance so who did kill him well at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry mr berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening so much for that a most unfortunate effort c'est la vie br br best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes hey maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes huh br br in its favour however are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers commentaries and featurettes for both films but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic
<START> i didn't approach still crazy with any real anticipation just another rock'n'roll picture i figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers this film is partially that but so much more brian gibson the director previously helmed a biography of tina turner and is quite successful in his style i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film br br the cast is well chosen bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band's frontman actor turned director bruce robinson appears as the band's washed up guitarist he does a superb job even though he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's if you're looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you've found it br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> let's think people quit bad mouthing the original for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece even still with all the stars story lines and art lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck but i dare say not as pretty as katee as starbuck br br i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar war of the gods the best was experiment in terra i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait then you had the women of battlestar not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by i loved the original as much as the new br br can you imagine if john calicos had a number six br br thankyou for listening
<START> i love movies and i'll watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i can't watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software and the long scenes of just walking and this movie is three hours long i didn't even make it 15 minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long distances this cost 5 million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening song br br oh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people that's hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward br br so like i said if you are a fan of boring stale action less movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didn't write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or money br br i know this is by the book but the book isn't that long and i'm a complete book worm nerd geek whatever but why just get the steven spielberg version it's not all that good but it's 10 times better than this br br i give this a big fat zero out of 10
<START> i saw mommy well she wasn't exactly kissing santa clause he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind br br this was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe he grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made and the lack of christmas spirit br br expecting a real slasher flick i was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies and there was no nudity at all what a bummer br br i wanted to like this flick but it was just too slow and really didn't have a good script i didn't expect great acting but i sure wanted some action there just wasn't any
<START> put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1 to 10 star scale br br bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually with their television series' yet each has had no success in big screen offerings this has also been true for other tv personalities perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10 minute skit or at most the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half hour program br br this film however doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv snl or anywhere else on a screen or stage br br its origination date is listed as 2002 but release date to dvd only is shown as 2004 it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfield's death so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs br br i'd never heard of it but found it when turning on my set and frankly became fascinated by it some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10 plan 9 from outer space is the best example and the bruce jenner village people opus can't stop the music is another br br unfortunately this flick falls short even there even if rodney's earlier work as well as some of his fellow cast members' fell short of citizen kane or casablanca there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest br br unfortunately this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or two's worth of such material
<START> down to earth 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br down to earth is such a mislead and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a chris rock standup comedy act on tv look like heaven speaking of heaven the film is based on the 1978 movie heaven can wait that was a good movie and this is good to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage directors chris and paul weitz miss nearly every target from concept to storytelling down to earth fails miserably this is one incredibly bad production br br chris rock is a lousy standup comedian both in his role in this movie and in the real life he plays lance barton whose manager frankie faison even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre soon after the script establishes his lack of talent the character is killed by a speeding truck death played by eugene levy has made a mistake taking lance before his number was up god's assistant chazz palminteri is very angry and decides to let lance make up the remainder of his time on earth as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire br br the old man's name is mr wellington whose life has problems of its own his wife jennifer coolidge is having an affair with his assistant greg germann who is robbing him of his money but that's all right because lance inside mr wellington has fallen in love with a young black woman named sontee regina king meanwhile there are plots to kill wellington lance attempting to get a better body and sontee's confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving mr wellington's finances br br down to earth has some good ideas but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material the biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive lance as mr wellington chris rock is the actor with popularity and publicity so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie all of the characters see the new lance as mr wellington but we see him as chris rock this is convenient for the love story we believe a young woman would fall for lance but in reality he is actually an old gray haired geezer that is not so convincing br br the one joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man but what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge just look at there's something about mary in the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences and not at their will here lance knows he is in an old man's body and does things old men would not normally do if lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential br br another problem with the concept we never knew mr wellington in the first place so how can we compare lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally to top everything off chris rock needs to be the center of attention here and makes the character too much like rock he recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful his dialogue is so obvious wooden and straightforward i hated the film's sense of humor there are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations it is like watching chris rock being chris rock not a character in a movie br br let's emphasize the positives in down to earth mark addy does not do any worse here than he did in the flintstones in viva rock vegas eugene levy and chazz palmentari are well cast but they are at the mercy of a scalped script those are all the good qualities i can mention at this time and if you give me another week to recollect it is not likely that i will come up with any more
<START> i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks if you like kung fu you would love this
<START> i watched the movie the flock because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a long while and i've seen some turkeys i've never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it's unbelievable the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it's nauseating poor gere he deserves so much better as for the gere danes on screen matchup because of the horrible writing one doesn't believe either character for a single minute i'll bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative were such a thing possible it's a shame to see talent wasted so badly not to mention i wish i could get my 2 hours back i know what you're thinking how do i really feel
<START> you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't particularly want to a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions but keeps on doing it all the same even the half hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i'm as guilty of this as anyone brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix a neat idea a kooky character whatever but without the funds to take it further than base level he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film coming to a multiplex near you in a parallel universe somewhere
<START> grey gardens is a world unto itself edith and little edie live in near total isolation eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their apparently shared bedroom cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter's elocution this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 real br br the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50 ish daughter lived for a decade other than that they were poor and clean they would bicker all day grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men work and self expression br br this film is a must see for anyone writing a mother daughter relationship of this kind it is sad and voyeuristic but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion
<START> well i gave this movie a 7 it was better than thirdspace but not as good as in the beginning as far as the b5 movies go i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal let's hope the producers and cast get the next series crusade up to the standards of b5
