<START> the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the 20th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments i don't think of this as a gay movie it's an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd

<START> this is one of the weakest soft porn film around i can't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes the guy mike is a major wimp and moron i can't believe he didn't want to take a shower with his bride to be toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer jan he does do a threesome with toni and kristi but that was short i hate that every time in soft core porn films threesomes between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl girl thing is about an hour to the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should've have two threesome scenes not one but two
<START> i was initially dubious about this movie merely because of the subject but the richly drawn characters the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it well worth watching i initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still haunted by the final scene
<START> those individuals familiar with asian cinema as a whole are aware that japan is renowned or notorious for it's hyper violent films and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films dog bites dog while not necessarily getting as hyper violent as the craziest miike film nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some koreas more ambitious efforts it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own the greatest strength this film has though like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts is that the brutality rather than detracting from the film actually develops the characters if not pushing the story forward the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such sam lee's character for instance is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely amidst various encounters with chang's character it is revealed why he is without spoiling this part of the story too much it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father chang's character on the other hand has his most primal instincts honed to if not perfection brutal efficiency surprisingly chang's story arch while not necessarily revealing a more human side actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal and no i am not talking about sam lee rather pei pei's garbage dump girl character ultimately however for the first 80 minutes or so it is a more or less straight forward cat and mouse or dog chase dog film in which every encounter ends in at least one death seriously once sam lee and chang square off some one will die and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act which brings us to the film's one weakness unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but to put it simply it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it don't get me wrong if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music in fact if it like the majority of the film kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job it still could have worked and not detract from the film as it is though despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters the way it was handled made it feel tacked on and almost insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across nevertheless it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted br br as far as pure film making technique goes this director is competent he's held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera but the actual editing camera angles camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional i've seen many movies where the directing was much worse at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there also the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go as far as artistic merit there is none the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film this is pure trash total garbage br br the gore is decent for a film in this budget range it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it and it's very outlandish br br i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing this was a good idea and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film unfortunately it's overdone especially towards the end br br it's really a terrible film but i have to recommend it for it's camp value it's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category
<START> in france it's considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him however a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects carrie 1976 the fury 1978 scarface 1983 without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock here in dressed to kill it's impossible not to think of vertigo 1958 for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in psycho 1960 about our involved film i don't want to revive the old debate does de palma rip off hitchcock instead i would tend to be generous and to classify dressed to kill in the category of de palma's winners alongside sisters 1973 and obssession 1976 with however some reservations and they're the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma's rabid fans and his detractors br br if there's one sure thing in dressed to kill which can generate general agreement among film lovers it's de palma's virtuosity in directing he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura the audience is easily glued in front of the screen this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures by the way in psycho there were also long silent suspenseful parts br br but the main drawback in de palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime then she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all it's a menu which smells the reheated and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one yes it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function one figures it's almost gratuitous filler perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows and even before who the killer is br br the two central mainsprings in de palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism the latter theme is well present in dressed to kill from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie and the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side br br i don't want to demean at all de palma's work his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects twenty six years after the controversy he aroused amid movie goers isn't ready to subside
<START> so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh well think again paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments the characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey it is journey worth experiencing don't miss it it is available on home video
<START> anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all time legendary bad movies the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge an adaptation of gore vidal's best selling book he later disowned this film version the star studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end the x rated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it's release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a near legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time br br director michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a half hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly film scenes of often lewd sexual acts and the process just doesn't work as intended this also caused a minor uproar as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permission br br perhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a nubile female film student farrah fawcett and teach the school's resident bad boy roger herren a lesson by raping him with a strap on dildo did everyone follow that br br and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective i have yet to mention the film's top billed star the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen thirties mae west ms west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom selleck throwing themselves at her as if this weren't bad enough the tone deaf west actually performs two newly written songs about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them br br naturally none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast tries really hard raquel in particular appears so hell bent in turning her poorly written part into something meaningful that she single handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics br br the rest of the cast is also fine the endearingly over the top john huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments rex reed isn't bad for a non actor and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh faced and likable roger herren is also fine but he never appeared in another movie again after this i guess he just couldn't live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch and as anyone could guess from the description above mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie but that's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema
<START> i just watched this movie and i've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there a friend lent me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story br br well the movie started off with kevin costner as a fighter pilot retiring why why did they make him a fighter pilot he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony quinn's character to be his new pilot well we never see costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie br br costner runs into a texan james gammon selling a horse to a big mexican businessman and costner tags along for a ride without knowing what happened gammon is beat to near death and costner drives him to the meeting which happens to be with an associate of quinn but nothing comes of it nada zilcho why did they have gammon's character why did they have the horse sale with the quinn associate if nothing was to come of it br br also after they leave costner for dead they make madeline stowe's character become a whore then she attacks one of quinn's men that was paying for a turn she stabs him with his own knife and the next thing she's been moved to a convent no explanation as to why she was moved or when it was done br br too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing i only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it i'm going to throw it at him for the 2 hours i wasted of my life watching the blasted thing
<START> description corny utterly stupid and worthless it's so cheap and lame it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget i'm guessing this probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater i am giving you the best advice in the world br br spare yourself spare your time life and money by not i repeat not even ponder about whether you should see this movie this movie is so corny it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom if you have a one digit iq then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie you might actually admire it like i said before if you have a one digit iq br br with about 12 actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music i gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap
<START> houseboat horror is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film which carried the promotion 'see the movie that can't get an academy award' an underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters it certainly delivers the gore heads are split in half with a machete throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try but you have been warned at least it's better than swedish the bleeder 4 out of 10
<START> a chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries in this delightful ealing studios comedy guinness is marvelous as the mild mannered but persistent chemist greenwood with her sensual voice plays the love interest parker is her harried father thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry while telling an engaging story the film also raises some intriguing questions about science the economy and politics it is adeptly directed by mackendrick who would go on to make the ladykillers and the sublime sweet smell of success later in the 1950s
<START> basic meaning of the story is a reality cruel true reality situations are very funny you have to laugh when you see how people can be stupid obstinate and crazy the best description will be if you watch it on your own
<START> i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen i read the comment from gumby 8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew unless gumby 8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all br br i couldn't believe gumby 8's comments br br quoting from the dune inspired opening animation to the quick pace this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected br br the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of 100 000 00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic as far as repeat viewing is not unexpected i think he made a typo br br another quote from gumby 8 the only fan the acting is also a strong aspect of the film br br with all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert napton br br the catchy tagline beware the hour between dusk and darkness br br that's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie br br mpaa rating rated r for some violence gore br br the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see as far as i know it might be a clump of grass br br in summation i have seen horror flicks from the 50's 60's and 70's i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good the director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction i would give this film a rating of 5 for a 'b' movie
<START> i just watched this movie today and not only is it terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it's clear crisp just filmed view br br thank heavens i work in a video store and i didn't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity do not buy or rent this movie you'd have a better time watching dude where's my car than this piece of crap and that's not saying a lot for that movie either br br the acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the movie br br i walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie i then took a shower and burnt my clothes br br if i had half a mind i would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it well maybe members of al queda especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole just make a set up like a clock work orange and then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again
<START> i wanted to vote zero or lower i loved the commentary it is the worst movie ever made and 'unendurable' is the perfect word for it unless there is something worse that roget never thought of i am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe bo derek the best that could be said of her is she's consistent
<START> reading all of the comments are very exciting but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast i realize that everyone refers to j j as the artist in the family but there was a real family that has the real artist and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet so if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist i would also like to tell him job well done i know this sight is for the good times cast but wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all i would like to know if he still paints or if he is still alive i would like to have some of his work displayed in my home
<START> when this first came out my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found 'the mind's eye' again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not 'finding nemo' quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this again it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended
<START> a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career while there is a lot of the eddie murphy character he plays a truly decent person the rest of the cast is good particularly the lovely charlotte lewis her character's beauty and serenity held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy
