<START> saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife who produced it took a q a afterwards br br i found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked br br certainly reminiscent of cinema paradiso it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba however don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous many references to the directors obvious love of film history a great bicycle thief homage and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious br br enjoy
<START> remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory br br while hollywood homicide is by no means terrible it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie it's a comedy that's not particularly funny and an action movie that's not especially exciting an overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline br br ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects and he is able to carry the film most of the time hartnett is adequate but he and ford aren't exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concerned br br all in all hollywood homicide is a reasonably amusing diversion but just barely take out ford and it's not even that
<START> this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever i had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie usually i don't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie br br the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today i mean the movie is g rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling there is a lot of smoking drinking murder death and hell depicted in the movie which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today don't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did br br rip judith barsi dom deluise
<START> i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor darth sidious he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian lando's co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film 1 when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded 2 when luke sees the spirits of obi wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker sebastian shaw the greatest scene in star wars 3 when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord br br i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v s luke skywalker on the death star post script the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 9 10
<START> a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards it's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs
<START> there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival it is dull plodding and lacking in suspense br br peter oÃtooleÃs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interest br br note some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series in one of his earliest roles
<START> after a slow beginning bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say it wasn't one of jim carrey's best performances but he was still ok morgan freeman was just right as god jennifer aniston had some good moments i miss steve correll on the daily show br br i like director tom shadyac's choices of movies he also did liar liar patch adams and the nutty professor in all three of those and in bruce almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him a director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find br br my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people that's too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity br br my grade br br 7 out of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city i was younger then but it was an excellent play so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it and why michael douglas he didnt suit the role this movie really sucked big time br br my advise is not to rent this movie save your money for something better like cats
<START> thank g d it bombed or we might get treated to such delights as skate fu where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor sharp skates but i digress one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t a from ms agbayani it's not like the world would have seen anything new at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread i truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better although aubrey hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer one explanation for kurt thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts it's a good thing the ioc wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals to be avoided at all costs
<START> the real shame of the gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the despicably shallow plot the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction takashima i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova even for just five minutes she has that sarcasm that wit that double edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable sadly though the babylon 5 pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination patricia tallman who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome telepath i shall leave you with one final thought why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer space frog man even though she is a woman thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show
<START> i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly 'vela' has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake br br unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'farscape' br br i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
<START> this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early 1950s this minimalist and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars richard widmark jean peters and richard kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of america and they'll stop at nothing to succeed br br the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents they know she is a link in a long espionage chain unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation a small time pickpocket widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen now it's widmark on his own with commies and the fbi hot on his trail br br widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish although she didn't get top billing a special mention should be made of thelma ritter this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady br br as far as the script and directing go they are very good but with one small exception at first i loved the way widmark and peters interacted it's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth now that's tough later inexplicably they become amazingly close too close to be believable still with so much great drama and such an effective noir like film this can be overlooked see this film
<START> iÂ´m from germany and i love the mvovies i go 200 times a year tonight i saw pecker it was a wonderful evening thank you mr waters everybody who has a chance to see the movie go
<START> i remember watching the disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch plenty of other renditions ever after put aside of cinderella have in fact lost their touch throughout the years then i found this production with a flawless performance by kathleen turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood br br we all know the story of cinderella a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella whose real name is zizola and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery to be trapped in a situation of her father who still lives slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step daughters against his own and tries to poison him thus zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way there the bored prince valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress forged by a water nymph named mab with rose petals for slippers br br what drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to it does not weave a web of lies like most cinderella stories it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did instead it shows more of cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning the costumes are all beautifully made especially zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the marcella plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft spirit like voice br br i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting twist my only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other fairy tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print
<START> i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time because it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from 60's present day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good 'ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed what's in all 4 segments so just wanted to be safe
<START> first off i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr chomsky's mouth his matter of fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus he comes across likable unassuming pragmatic he doesn't cater to the current political style obnoxious bi partisanship and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right chastising both and for good reason br br unfortunately the film itself is a dud in fact i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches watching rebel without a pause is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on cspan there are no camera movements no edits no stylistic touches there is no story no narrative br br technically speaking the production is strictly amateurish audio is terrible and inconsistent sometimes we cannot hear noam speak other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her br br i cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car br br 4 out of 10 stars and i'm in a generous mood today
<START> i watch them all br br it's not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but it's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts br br i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream don't watch 'how she move ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar br br there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar it's just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because i'm a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american br br i loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies br br in summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie
<START> and a made for tv movie too this movie was good the acting in it and the plot was just so great this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie but it's very easily over looked br br antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on four times and it too kicked was great if you ever see this movie come on tv i'd watch it the effects in this movie were pretty well done i honestly don't know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad br br watch it it's really good no really it is
<START> i'm too old to know or care exactly what the difference between rap and hip hop is and being canadian it's likely that i've never actually seen mtv but i'm not certain br br but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it a bright little satire hip hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over if only we could say the same about bagpipe music i got most of the jokes at least i think i did sure it's derived from spinal tap but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment just not the carpenters they're sacred
<START> it's not a terrible movie really and glenn and keitel are top notch actors further they do an acceptable job with the very weak script the scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists further i umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film they are professionals and they get paid for it but i do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences even if a film is a box office flop surely it makes some money if you are a fan of keitel or glenn rent the video or catch it on tv as did i granted the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with mexico but the experience is far better than 90 of the standard tv fare of today
