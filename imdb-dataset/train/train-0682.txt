<START> soylent green is a really good movie actually br br i never would've thought it i don't really like heston in his sci fi efforts he's one of those actors who like superman manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time i prefer more vulnerable heroes and indeed he sneers his way through much of soylent green too but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i don't really mind br br i can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals what do you know it looks just like 1973 and it's lacking in action but i admired the film's vision of a complex corrupt and highly stratified society and i was so pleased to see that edward g robinson had such a moving funny final role nice little character moments like when he shares some precious food with heston really make the movie br br the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to funny isn't it to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie
<START> daniel day lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real br br i remember many years ago we had a party in our house the friends came over we were sitting around the table eating drinking the wine talking laughing having a good time the tv was on there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing the glasses did not clink the forks did not move the food was getting cold on the plates we could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor when he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character br br jim sheridan's my left foot is an riveting unsentimental bio drama about christy brown the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a dublin slum who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life br br i like every one of day lewis's performances i have mixed feelings about his performance in gony but i believe that his greatest role was christy brown in my left foot
<START> capitÃ£es de abril is a very good the story isn't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in portugal but it gives us an idea of how it was like the fiction of the story isn't of great interest but it doesn't spoil the movie the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of april revolution br br all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully lisbon looks beautiful as ever don't miss it i liked this film very much
<START> i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features first off the film is undeniably cheaply made with its cardboard sets limited settings and creative scientific props the acting ranges from very poor the two strippers barely professional herb evers as the leading man gothic overstatement leslie daniels as the assistant kurt to first rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be this film is a thinking film in many ways however don't be too fooled by its real intent it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties
<START> first off i'd like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film what's a movie without sam niel did anyone see event horizon d wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't nope no sam niel no good movie i recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent d wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a sam niel film apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend br br jurassic park dead calm hunt for red october event horizon not jurassic park three br br overall d wars is a pile
<START> i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this don't miss this one
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but it was just imposable the acting was ultra hammy the plot was annoying and the pace was slow sooo slowwwwww the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end twenty minuets into a films and i'm praying for an ending sure some of the visuals were nice but c'mon guys i mean really and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of the music there was was annoying and boring there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too those were also annoying mainly this film managed to bore me and creep me out at the same time br br i'm glad its over i need to go see tideland and wash this bad taste out of my mouth
<START> saw this movie when it came out in 1959 left a lasting impression great group of actors a little short timewise but a great movie all the same have only seen once since then and that was some time ago hopefully they'll put it out on dvd if they haven't already
<START> samuel fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema br br richard widmark plays a petty thief tough guy a role he perfected over the course of many movies who snatches a young lady's jean peters wallet on a new york subway and with it a piece of much wanted microfilm this is 1953 so of course the microfilm is property of commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back when the girl shows up at widmark's waterfront shack sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her comrades down for big money the plot thickens people start dying and widmark and peters fall in love br br fuller handles the love story clumsily but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction it's as if he included a love story under duress and so made it intentionally unbelievable as love stories so frequently were and still are in hollywood films peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough new yawk cookie part gangster moll and part damsel in distress when violence occurs against her we genuinely care about her well being and it's typical of fuller's renegade ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion br br but the ultimate success of pickup on south street rests squarely on the world weary shoulders of thelma ritter who plays moe a feisty lady who makes money any way she can whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant ritter gives the performance of her career in a breathtaking monologue she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle crime and hardship it's as if every character ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies the scene is the highlight of fuller's film and a highlight of 50s cinema period br br grade a
<START> the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures rather than characters i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies i'm talking about the tv series not the full length movies but some of them were pretty cool and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant but this series is pure garbage as soon as i saw the animation and heard the characters and i use that term loosely speak i cringed also mystery inc was a team and without the entire crew to compliment each other it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants what's new scooby doo was better than this if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series include the elements that made the series endure so long the entire cast of characters and quality animation they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came
<START> the horse is indeed a fine animal picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick br br the animation is simply stupendous the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain jumps across cliffs and braves waters br br soundtrack too is very impressive the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie br br they say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse huh well the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west br br all in all this movie is clearly up there with the best it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched would be a very fine choice on a lonely night an easy 9 10
<START> although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters br br this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether br br this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
<START> i saw this when it was in the theater it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations and other related psychological factors now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining it builds to an excellent climax then it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it besides being a very poetic description in my experience it was just not strong enough my wife and i were well how can i say this we were upset i mean we paid money invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly in fact my wife said it best it did not end it just stopped
<START> this film essentially deals with inspector gadget's arch nemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the now peaceful city of metropolis claw's plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer cooler crimefighter to help destroy gadget's popularity sadly the film fails miserably the series was great but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just doesn't cut it anymore dr claw is not only visually less frightening but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original intimidating self granted this is a children's movie but the plot is so painfully weak heaven forbid i mention the animation that it pales in comparison to the original series someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed she now has some quasi punk rebellious clothing style and doesn't play half the role that she did in the tv series the gadgetmobile talks as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars maybe i'm just a kid who loved the show who's grown up jaded but i thought that the live action version was more pain than i could bear but now they go and spring this complete watering down of the quality tv series on us it's more than i can take
<START> the sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch it's smart it's quirky it's funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really don't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch br br further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you don't love them too i've laughed at their wisecracks been torn when they've made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal br br the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext people aren't always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds br br if you haven't already you most definitely should
<START> i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton zelah clarke adaptation of jane eyre because i'd just written an article about the 2006 bbc jane eyre for thescreamonline br br so i approached watching this the way i'd approach doing homework br br i was irritated at first the lighting in this version is bad everyone everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the characters br br and the sound is poorly recorded i felt like i was listening to a high school play br br and the pancake make up is way too heavy br br and the sets don't fully convey the gothic mood of the novel they are too fussy too martha stewart i just can't see bronte's rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements orson welles' rochester lived in cave like gloom very appropriate to the novel's gothic mood br br and yet with all those objections not only is this the best jane eyre i've seen it may be the best adaptation of any novel i've ever seen br br this jane eyre in spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first time br br the critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less wordy or any less christian or any more sexed up this version's faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest asset br br bronte wrote a darn good book there's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus while other slicker sexier and easier texts have disappeared br br as a long time jane eyre fan i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is famously not handsome jane and rochester are literature's famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome br br but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away i've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and rochester's love for jane dalton brings the page's rochester to quivering life on screen br br rochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really can't tell if he's going to hurt jane or himself in his desperation br br rochester's imperiousness his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart it's stunning br br and here's the key thing the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly life destroying secret br br no other actor i've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby stephens doesn't even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar i would say that guy is trouble don't even look at him he's that radioactive with tamped down agony br br zelah clarke is not only overall the best jane i've seen she's one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the 2006 version bronte did not describe a statuesque robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips rather charlotte bronte's jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not pretty br br zelah has a small mouth close set eyes and a bit of a nose she's truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the truest to the book br br some described her a cold or boring no she's true to the book bronte's jane is not a red hot mama she's a sheltered deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as zelah's do here the book's jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully patiently observantly if you want to truly plumb her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really is br br i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very good br br in spite of its closeness to the text this version like every other version i've seen shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is central br br helen burns instructs jane in christianity thus giving her a subversive counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed pinched life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal that isn't made fully clear here br br in any case charlotte bronte wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones i've seen mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation i've seen and that says a lot br br other versions that don't fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you don't care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester br br this version like bronte's novel realizes that everything bronte wrote about jane's experiences at lowood and her relationship to st john are part of what makes jane's relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is
<START> i understand there was some conflict between leigh and the great maggie smith during the filming understandable when you put one of the world's greatest actresses of all time smith of course with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent film
<START> i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor actress to get people any people to come see it and give the movie exposure bobby myeres played by modine and his partner saul paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bates a name actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content
<START> although the director tried the filming was made in tynisia and morocco this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies while the duration is very long but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon who doesn't seem to understand the demands of his role
<START> an adaption of the book 'finding fish' this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher derek luke who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport denzel washington a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington br br this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn't win an oscar i think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked i strongly recommend this film to everyone you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone fisher br br if you like inspirational true stories then watch antwone fisher br br thank you
