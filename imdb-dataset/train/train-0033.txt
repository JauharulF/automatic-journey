<START> this movie was like the disney channel after dark take out the aren't we naughty language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe saved by the bell as quality television the dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty one might think the screenplay was the product of locking aaron spelling and joe eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating if that was roger kumble's intention mission accomplished
<START> before watching this film i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw complete with the shack like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs mjh's name on a movie would typically turn me away ugh can we say gross but i still wanted to give it a try br br starting out i was a bit interested the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters especially the man that played sulley mjh was even worst but i continued to watch br br however the ending was the biggest joke of them all i seriously sat in shock thinking that was the ending is this a comedy br br i thought this pile of crap was funnier than the scary movie spoofs and that is really saying something
<START> i'm not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time i would like to say however that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous johnnymacbest you can't play that card and i mean the nationalism patriotic card to make people not watch this movie this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country oh yea i played that card even though the director is german and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera but the world is full of controversy and its the same thing you've heard before like the gta controversy it's a comedy laugh and be disgusted not disgusted all together its dark humor and obviously you don't have the heart to take it the past is past yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on that was 7 years ago you can still watch this movie and have good moral values br br besides i'm insane and who needs a soul
<START> this movie is rich with action and gore the story line is strong enough to support the action sequences the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable this movie ranks among my personal favorites next to hard boiled
<START> you don't need to write a script for this trashed outrage you just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at the jerry show violent and obnoxious this cash in on the real jerry springer program reveals everything that the over rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of cops even the outside world of springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade this goes to show you that the gong show movie had a central character in a motion picture turkey change the channel rejected br br
<START> timeless musical gem with gene kelly in top form stylish direction by vincente minnelli and wonderful musical numbers it is great entertainment from start to finish one of those films that people watch with a smile and say they don't make 'em like they used to but they never did quite make them like this the climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history movie magic clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved a must see
<START> worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon i suppose that this is a horror comedy i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie the special effects were not so special i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house i wish i could have something good to say about this movie but i am afraid that i don't even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey i do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended
<START> i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film at the time the only words that escaped my mouth were awesome just awesome i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so br br the story is intriguing and thought provoking and the acting is first rate from all the principals this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for back with universal after his long arduous battle with them over brazil terry had achieved what he wanted most the final cut terry is a master craftsman and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept unfortunately limitations still exist in such arrangements br br the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box it contains among other things a director producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly striking the team with feelings of self doubt and despair fortunately for all of us they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success br br
<START> in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes the tag line was is it real or is it memorex the same might be said for the events in this episode a compilation and remix of the cage the first pilot of star trek mr spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt christopher pike his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed to return there why the finagling because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence why this is so is never explained that bothered me tremendously but if nothing else it adds to the story after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv mr spock turns himself in to dr mccoy the senior most officer present capt kirk was off the ship for arrest and says the charge is mutiny dr i never received orders to take over the ship what follows is a court martial in which thanks to the talosians we learn why it was so important besides the obvious paralysis for capt pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr spock's death the illusions the talosians create the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic and meg wyllie as the keeper the head talosian is wonderful call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect the talosians having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion are also unisex you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter this episode more than almost any other in the series makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced what a neat thing if this were so this is one of my favorite episodes and no matter how many times i've seen it i even have it on video it never fails to fascinate me meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly
<START> it's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy something told me it would be a great film in spite of that it seemed very unlikely that i'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then one day while looking through the online catalogue of my local library i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i'm extremely glad for because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate br br and speaking of the cinematography i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy i'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single handedly carry a film here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan ruiz anchÃ­a behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away br br the director christopher cain has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather this film is not very representative of it but sometimes to catch a director near the beginnings of his career before all the big budgets and loss of focus there's a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film lets things happen with a life of their own and then ever further much like early john sayles films characters are given space to breathe time to talk side stories happen because they do and that's how life is cain displays a remarkable raw even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film br br the acting ties much of this story together when people talk when they exist in this film they do so as actual people not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina berriault's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley robert duvall glenn close and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance it all comes down with the weight of pure reality br br when you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by james horner it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music but that's not the 80s i lived in or remember the look of the images the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is br br for more of this feeling please see br br the black stallion 1979 never cry wolf 1983 tender mercies 1983 testament 1983 places in the heart 1984 matewan 1987 high tide 1987 driving miss daisy 1989 the secret garden 1993 the secret of roan inish 1994 wendy and lucy 2008
<START> from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer bad acting even peter falk can't find his way finding john christmas is better left lost ms bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co stars william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah jennifer pisana as soccoro the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing but who can blame them with material like this michael j murray's script is juvenile at best br br each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen films like miracle on 34th street ernst lubitsch's delightful the shop around the corner and of course the 1951 version of scrooge there's frank capra's classics it's a wonderful life and meet john doe hey forget the classics what about home alone or home for the holidays with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr br br my present to you is by way of advice your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding finding john christmas merry christmas
<START> a little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other it is assumed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter after this trauma the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence all of this changes when one day many years later she receives a phone call from her daughter with the help of an ex cop and a reporter she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive los sin nombre is a mess plot wise moves at an achingly slow pace and is completely unscary the saving grace is emma vilarasau who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother the best part of the movie is the ending but i'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film beware of the english subtitles on the recent r1 release they aren't very accurate
<START> if i had realized john wayne was in this movie i would not have watched it it's demeaning to the japanese unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person but then most john wayne movies are like that hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was and still is somewhat different the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated to put it as succinctly as possible this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap sort of a madama butterfly with bad music
<START> i hated the first episode of this show 'protesting hippies' so much in 1999 that i shunned the rest however when it came on 'the paramount comedy channel' i watched it in full and to my surprise found it absolutely hilarious motto never judge a comedy series in its first week br br set in 1969 'hippies' stars simon pegg as 'ray purbbs' editor of an 'oz' like underground magazine called 'mouth' his friends are the feminist jill laid back alex and the half wit hugo back in the late '60's there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read rather than sneering at the hippies' naivety 'hippies' is affectionate towards it arthur mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons 'hair' 'woodstock' 'the graduate' even the infamous 'oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's excellent performances from the cast julian rhind tutt's 'alex' strangely put me in mind of the richard o'sullivan character from 'man about the house' its a shame that there was never a second series possibly because of people like me if you missed 'hippies' give it a try once you get past the dire opener you're in for a treat
<START> i haven't watched the movie yet but can't wait to see it it seems very interesting and inspirational it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the battle within thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing this film looks so fresh and smart and the actor is really hot i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies really clever i thought that the topic selected overcoming adversities and childhood traumas is timeless and god knows a lot of people need it bring it on
<START> an excellent film with great performances from zack lochley much to their displeasure mine garibaldi arrived on station all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 5 i lost sympathy for the character it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack who i love best of all on the show and taking charge i'm sure zack could have coped the soulhunter plot is fascinating especially if you believe in heaven as zack does the humour supplements it nicely 10 10
<START> oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played 'scarecrow' was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary and revolting sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot but it just came out awful to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot the actors besides 'scarecrow' we're awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do
<START> there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short br br the grinch i thought was marvellous jim carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying i used to like him very much in his waynes world and so i married an axe murderer days but ive never been fond of austin powers and the cat in the hat has just finished me off br br this film was horrible the gags were horrible inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years the plot was messy messy messy its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was mom they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly revolting over acted portrayal of the cat br br i mean did myers even glance at a script was one written the other actors seemed to have one but the cat just seemed to be winging it br br on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous but unfortunately they cant save this film br br poor dr seuss the man was a genius dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy messy way br br 1 10
<START> visually speaking this film is stunning it has some delightful black comedic moments but on the whole the plot is very clichÃ©d as is its seeming message if you're a fan of over the top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw you'll love it if you're looking for something at all high brow steer away i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing ultimately it isn't disturbing just grinding and unpleasant to sit through if you genuinely want to be challenged go see something like the lost if you want to be grossed out or tell your friends about a really messed up film then this is for you
<START> or it's a bird it's a plane no look it's a disaster or no need to look up in the sky br br or ok that's enough if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record he failed the sr structure can't do this the dark and restricted color scheme i would call it wishi washi the boring usual dialogs the clown with advanced alien technology the missing fun and magic etc makes the movie completely disappointing br br it simply doesn't work br br the main thing at a character like superman is that he is a superhero that's the core the most important thing br br love trouble and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2 40 long superman movie not the whole time br br because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore it's like a and in this case a very bad and boring social study where every 30 minutes a person flies around br br that's a big difference br br this movie is a joke holy skywalker this is superman so give us supervillains superaction and the most important thing superfun br br we want entertainment singer if you want to make a 2 40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake br br they say superman returns and then supersadlysoftie stands in the door br br maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite but one bad movie can't do this don't give up they plan a sequel br br next time singer and warner brothers make a superhero movie not a depressive superlame soap or let it be a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic br br this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover yes technically there are all sorts in yes there is a lot of small talks there are a few jokes a view action scenes etc but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality br br it's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live br br the ridiculous cast strategy cast them young as possible so we can make sequels in the next 25 years gives the rest kate bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter she's looking like 19 superman was full five years away so he slept with her 6 years ago so she was 16 looking like 13 and a daily planet reporter wroting i spend a night with superman warner brothers that's too much br br routh is not so bad he is playing a little bit wooden but the whole movie is wooden so temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey the rest forget it even spacey this is not his terrain br br reeve hackman kidder were acting so easy with fun what a difference br br the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too what the hell should that be the problem here is they mean this serious not as a joke next time spiderman or batman or ironman falls and rises like jesus or angels or they speak with god directly why not they are superheroes saving human lives every day so at least one talk with god every week should be possible oh my god br br maybe this was not the real announced movie instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe br br for the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history not only because of the money br br i understand how difficult it maybe was to create and transport some messages or feelings but showing lone lost and sadly people isn't new and thousands of movies or tv shows did it better in very old or new ones like magnolia and the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman sorry superman of course br br singer and wb that's simply nothing in fact it's even more than nothing it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for comic superhero movies and steals us three hours of our life br br mrs smilla's little brother very angry and green like the hulk
