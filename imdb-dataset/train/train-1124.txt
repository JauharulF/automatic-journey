<START> i just have to add in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet these other reviewers aren't joking around this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see br br they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie it really does like the director took the family hi8 camcorder before dv cameras and computer non linear editing no other equipment lights sound gear etc grabbed some decent looking acting students and went out to shoot a movie no script just making it up as he went along br br when i watched it it was on my mono tv so i only have one channel of audio left of right speaker at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog they recorded the sound on different bloody channels i mean there's movies that can be funny to watch so bad they're good kind of thing i'm not sure this is one of those i mean i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better you know but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it br br as bad as they were the actors are the only good thing about this i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 but alas no if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap throw in some gratuitous nudity worked for roger corman
<START> no wonder this was released straight to dvd here in australia no redeeming features what so ever the dialog was hokey the acting awful and the script sucked whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior john badham film wargames from the 80s well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea amanda walsh was good in it as the eye candy love interest while matt lanter was good as the other main lead that is about it i would not recommend wargames the dead code to anyone check out hackers or the original wargames film both are better than this piece of crap
<START> shall we dance is an excellent film because it shows how something like dancing can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit br br dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality the is certainly the case with aoki at work he is a humble office denizen but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released surprisingly this release is frowned upon in japan due to the rigid culture of conformity at the start of the film all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance they will be scorned or deemed perverted for expressing their passion through dance br br this film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions it will leave a smile on your face for days
<START> i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes i try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a needy family but several factors get in the way for me every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me the fact that everyone who donates something to the house be it sears or whoever has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disney abc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights isn't life difficult enough for the average person why do i need help finding things to feel sad about why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative i know what is being done for these families is good but they are also being used for ratings you can't tell me they aren't being coached sometimes on the crying i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the u s could not afford for their children it really bothers me i can't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disney's money instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food clothes education and medical insurance i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry in terms of money i feel the same about oprah i don't think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses yes her recent reality show did good things but when she gave 30 000 to each losing contestant i'm sitting here thinking that's a years salary for many many people if they're lucky don't get me started on game shows so i realize that extreme makeover home edition is doing good but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself is there anyone out there that feels similar
<START> this is one of the most calming relaxing and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie this movie is not just great for kids but adults too it teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring this movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies this movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie spirit is definitely one of them with my vote of 9 10 stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of spirit
<START> before i see on this film i see a lot of comments which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad br br what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf he may not be in many parts of the film but when he appears or even the intro i was astonished by will smith's and woody harrelson message they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on br br i am not a very sentimental person i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it but a act to show redemption there is not many films that in my point of view can show this this is one of them that can br br i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of suicide is a downfall however i do not believe that is the message the film is trying to send but sacrifice a bit to the extreme but that is the message in my opinion br br this film has potential the acting it is worth every penny the script is unbelievable from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films if you like drama this is a must go watch
<START> seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend 15 on this i also think this applies to eva longoria fans br br the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president as the investigation unfolds it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete michael douglas pleading innocence pete goes on the fun fugitive style to search for the truth br br it's solid but certainly not spectacular a decent cast a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty but you could certainly do far worse
<START> after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost adam's worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fan br br the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy which has the same people in it peter dante who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian bird br br this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 100
<START> before we begin i have a fear of dentists this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe that is what i love about this film the movie is kind of boring for that i take 3 stars off br br spoiler alert br br the movie revolves around dr alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him soon he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients killing co workers and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with br br end spoiler br br the movie is very bloody and gory i would recommend it if you are into gore br br i give this film 7 stars out of 10 dr alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist
<START> this docu drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough the man who gave us gandhi beautifully photographed compellingly casted well written in the measured literate manner that hollywood discarded in the 30's and scrupulously accurate it stands out as a genre film excelling in its portrayal of native american or more appropriately for its canadian setting first nations culture and standing with black robe as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture here circa 1934 this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject archie grey owl belaney a scot raised in hastings england by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the red indian tales of his childhood that he went to canada disappeared into the woods and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning br br indian brides none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character one of his wives one smarter than he by most accounts propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north and this forms the focus of attenborough's tale the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau as grey owl's wife pony is engaging and if not firey is nonetheless quite touching a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd
<START> it's the early 80s there's a group of suspiciously old looking teens and there's a maniac stalking around yes this is slasherville br br this movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i haven't the faintest idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you go br br the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of them br br pranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because let's face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time for slasher film and video nasty completists only
<START> the derek's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes in fact this film can be regarded as belonging to the so bad it's good category right up there with the products of the likes of edward wood jr or doris wishman this explains the imdb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marks br br anthony quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad it has to be seen to be believed
<START> why do i like disorganized crime so much why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie it's kind of hard to explain but i'll give it a try first of all it's very funny indeed in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again that depends entirely on your sense of humour so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue and often it is situational comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them they just stand there by the road covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally unnerved then realizing the humour of the scene they one by one start laughing about themselves and ruben blades as carlos looking and certainly smelling terrible nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again which leads to the second point the acting fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ ruben blades and corbin bernsen okay the latter overdoes it a bit at times all fit and play their parts beautifully in fact you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film thirdly there is the plot jim kouf the director and screenwriter is very laid back he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not there is no real action and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people who attempt to rob a bank although their boss bernsen does not seem to turn up grumble about each other and even tually grudgingly like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across because it per fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way therefore take my advice watch this film but if you don't chuckle grin or smile during the first 10 minutes forget it it's not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay if you happen to know how do tell me
<START> no rubbish no where even near rubbish not an original thats the last thing that could be said of 2 4 children predictable certainly not although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc it was hilarious funny and witty i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard who i believe preformed wonderfully gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members i never quite new why it was can celled till reading here today about gary olsen's death at a relatively young age i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type much more of them and show them here in israel thumbs way up
<START> billy chung siu hung's the bloody swordplay film assassin from 1993 film love to kill hong kong 1993 is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness br br the hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the untold story by herman yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesn't leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr lamb 1992 by billy tang and co directed by lee and the killer 1989 by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesn't like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultra mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm br br the film is almost completely without any serious merits as it's just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mind blowing when some most taboos for westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film too br br the film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992 usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise there's nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastiness meter br br the actors and actresses are talented and professional and so don't make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goings on even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lee's erection and so on something that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses br br the film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of wong's wife in various ways she gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from wong's own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious way br br the film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw i've seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible i'm not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in films entertainment would never accept or make something like it women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females br br the other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled taiwanese dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version i've also heard that the old hk laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical release br br the film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former having written also films like dr lamb the untold story and gunmen kirk wong 1988 but out of his other films that i've seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr lamb and the untold story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the untold story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but there's none of this in love to kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime triad bureau 1993 crime story 1993 wong br br love to kill earns no more than 2 10 from me as i don't have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art
<START> this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious dvr hard drive space i didn't expect much and i actually received less not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter's hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the '07 fall schedual perhaps a hospital crime mocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good
<START> after viewing whipped at a distributor's screening at the afm the other night i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed the audience was laughing all the way through unfortunately every territory was already sold so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas i agree with the comment that whipped should not be pitched as a male sex and the city mainly because unlike sex and the city whipped is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously whipped pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare also the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than swingers clerks and sex and the city combined whipped never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non stop comedy the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid which only made the film more impressive considering the budget
<START> reading my review of the house that screamed many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered classic horror this is not the case as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life but admittedly i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher zombie ghost cannibal etc types of horror films so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster paced just like someone who can appreciate different music painting or in this case film but not necessarily like them i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film i just don't br br the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls the heavy handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand or whip in some cases to keep the girls in line she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower in their nightgowns no less and meanwhile girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus br br i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake i'm all for tension and suspense in horror films but this film held neither for me luckily i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one so i can't say i was really disappointed the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's this isn't a hard and fast rule but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception probably a must see for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material i can't really recommend this one 4 10
<START> after the failure of the crusades at the box office cecil b demille stopped doing films about non american history his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii dr wassell the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok with jean arthur as calamity jane james ellison was buffalo bill john miljan not a villain as usual was general george a custer and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn the villains were led by charles bickford selling arms to the indians and porter hall as jack mccall who killed wild bill hickok br br basically the film takes up the history of the u s after the civil war lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered lincoln talks about the need to secure the west more about this point later then he announces he has to go to the theater that april 14th must have been very busy for abe in virginia city he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same date br br actually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it's citizens into the union as soon as possible it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west except for the problems of maximillian and his french controlled forces in mexico against juarez but he had been involved in actual problems with the west in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope the loser at second manassas to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux the subject of mckinley kantor's novel sprit lake pope incompetent against lee and jackson turned out to be quite effective here and the revolt was smashed br br however with all lincoln's actual attention to western problems it is doubtful that he says as cooper repeats at least once the frontier should be secure there is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman like saying teddy roosevelt said eat a good breakfast every morning for your health it is not a profound statement of policy it is at best a statement of recognizable fact cooper turning it into a minor mantra like lincoln's version of the monroe doctrine is ridiculous typical of the way demille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them br br however this is not a ruinous mistake the plainsman is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle as such it is well worth watching but not as a textbook on lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy
<START> fascinating i approached i am curious yellow and it's companion piece with great trepidation i'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex what i got wasn't this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame' or boring' approached the film as if it were pornography perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses but it is intentionally un erotic lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human this touch gives her even more believability out necessity had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream
