<START> i hadn't seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didn't miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anyway br br everything based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crew's ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95 true to the book upon which it was based al schmid marine by roger butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isn't about glorifying war i can't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service not right away anyway br br what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to re claim their lives there's an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel that's another reason why the film was so so well received it was exceptionally well written there's a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmid's were nearly the same and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors don't do that much anymore but added to the equation it's just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story
<START> i saw this film a while ago on a video cd br br i will 1st mention the good points br br the movie at first at least tries to appear that it is not biased like not showing one character as black and the other as white both main characters are friends and co exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport sport rifle shooting as comrades not as competitors br br but after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict sure the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began br br the history the 1990 elections the people who caused the war are not mentioned the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliament's 2nd largest party sdp according to the constitution of bosnia the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992 but there was a coup in january the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secession br br the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic a man suspiciously absent from stth he was a student of nazism in ww2 he even wrote his own mein kampf in which he stated it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between 'the islamic religion' and non islamic social and political institutions br br in 1990 he lost the idap elections to pro yugoslavia moderate fikret abdic a bosnian muslim that worked with christian serbs during the civil war and who treated his supporters like brothers abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic who lost the elections but seized the seat of power br br the events from above are missing from the movie but they are the factual events that lead to the war br br there were problems with props too serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets which they did not use also the one soldier was holding an m 1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslavia br br the director and script writers had a chance but they chose to re write history
<START> yes i know i'm one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivion so let me me tell you why i feel this way in truth had it been advertized as a zombie film or the like i might have enjoyed it but right now i'm totally speechless br br spoiler though i'm not sure what's to spoil let's start with the first huge flaw if i did not know that the movie is called darkness the vampire version and had i not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood i would not have seen the connection with vampires i mean fangless give me a break br br second bad point what's with the metal it appears that all young people but mainly those so called vampires are into various kinds of metal judging mainly by their shirts don't get me wrong i've been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years but nobody 's going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in iron maiden of all bands t shirts running around pretending to be vampires pathetic is the only only word that i could use here br br third weakness the actors wait a minute what actors you mean the director's wooden friends words would be a waste here br br yes alright the movie is very gory but what difference does that make it would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the briliant director had not chosen to create an artificial vampire topic in this movie i wanted to see vampires but was treated to some stupid looking kids i would have loved to use my baseball bat on the film makers should simply have advertized the movie saying cheap b grade horror with no plot but a lot of gore br br this movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism and it makes me sick
<START> this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war the memories for many soldiers men and women alike returning home can be the beginning of real problems i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii for one of my uncles the war was never over he survived the d day invasion something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins his sons jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war in a different country the result is the same when i saw this at the kc filmfest i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right br br the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all the first casualty of war is innocence
<START> the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so unpopular i found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung it's fans br br simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to this is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat you won't listen to the beegees in the same light ever again
<START> it aint bad but it aint good it is just entertaining br br as a comedy which it is supposed to be it's dreadful not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before br br it's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually but none of them really do much and the ending sucks
<START> i think this movie is well done and realistic i you are used to watching hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed this movie is much closer to real life than 95 of what hollywood can produce and that is what lifts it above the average action movie i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act but as i have seen the making of extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch high quality realistic story and movie
<START> for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies funny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything br br i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience br br
<START> i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of disney's holes i don't know who decided to show it but i'm so very glad they did cracker bag is an absolute gem a snapshot of australia in the early 80s as seen through a child's eye the conversations between eddie and her brother were hilarious and as with the rest of the film so true to life each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood being the same age as the director probably helps a little and the audio multiplied the feeling i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day
<START> the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia newton st john's foreign speech pattern is not explained it's explained here caulfield is her cousin what's conn still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she's a beautician br br caulfield's a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd and that's especially bad when zmed's girl friend decides she likes caulfield but being a nerd just isn't going to cut it br br that's when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted br br grease 2 introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out br br in addition to conn eve arden sid caesar and dody goodman all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles the music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original br br it's not that grease 2 is bad it's just not all that great
<START> i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable and watched it with anticipation to see my memories brought alive again because i adored the original show imagine my dismay br br this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made they changed the story they changed the songs they lost the soul i was expecting a trip down memory lane singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror at the ballet and hello twelve hello thirteen not not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point but they messed up the storyline adding songs and exterior plotlines hello cassie and michael douglas not present in the original and injecting drama where it wasn't necessary the original had enough pathos on its own if you were a fan of the original broadway show don't bother i'm sorry i wasted my time and diluted my memories watching this tripe
<START> i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds pervy i'm not of 'rape revenge' flicks of the 70's i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out my conclusion let's stick to the classics yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing even dawson is empty some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity i wasn't expecting anything 'irreversible' style but still aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her i didn't not for a minute she was so lame all the way and i read that the photography was impressive well it is good indeed but nothing ground breaking either i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again lol more seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks fire walk with me' the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general lascivious decadent atmosphere no i just couldn't get into this movie too bad
<START> if you seen rodney dangerfield's previous movies and performances you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck written like a sitcom this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout from the self help doctor played by the aways sexy as chopped liver molly shannon to the 'i'm fat and therefore funny' john linette the 5 wives themselves are likeable enough and if this had been done as a pilot for an action adventure series it might have worked instead it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect
<START> just recently i've been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that i almost had to see it well having just seen it today the 5 8 rating is completely understandable i think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need it turns out not to be worth it br br sure the hills have eyes 2 has its moments it has a very cool and well developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself but the whole thing is so self indulged that it becomes so hard to follow and if it weren't for wes craven's production on this film it wouldn't be anything to do with the original remake br br but the whole thing makes you go is this supposed to be horror or comedy because there are lots of ridiculous randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners i e there's a hand in the sh er or you motherfu er i'll kill you all damn sons of b tches and the acting god don't even remind me how bad it was br br storyline this part contains spoilers beware the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby ooh la la and then the screen fades to black with the movie's title appearing and a monologue then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants the box to keep track of audio feeds is gone and everyone dies after that tone setting opening you'd expect more br br then we go to this one team of military recruits training in baghdad as the captain parades them a good job at stupidity their last day of training is in new mexico the desert where the family in the last thhe had stayed because they were stuck while in training things go ultimately wrong people die and do i need to tell you any more because right now i have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this br br the thing that's wrong with thhe2 is that it just dosen't work no flashbacks here and the ending is pretty safe but with a twist a stupid one that is i'm pretty sure the ultra super director's cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of it's alternate endings but at this point i'm not sure if i care br br so by all means if you loved the first thhe so much it's almost a sin not to see this then by all means see it but if else then avoid at all costs it's for your own good br br 3 10
<START> this should be my kind of movie even if it sucked it still should have been right up my alley hell i like congo and allan quatermaine movies i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien demon adventure movies let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place br br 1 horror sci fi almost always intrigues me 2 i'm a big fan of archaeology and this movie does involve a rare treasure 3 super natural enemies with quality fx 4 christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy 5 tara reid is hot br br so this movie had potential at least in the cheese horror section of the video store but boy did it suck ass the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do i mean let's face it both are melodramatic but now on to some of the many faults br br tara reid even though the movie as a whole is worse reid's performance is truly awful we're not just talking bad i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year i don't know if she is capable of acting but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league completely watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn i mean this isn't just bad it is laughably bad oh and for those of you curious she doesn't get naked only down to a bra in a silly totally unnecessary love scene br br even with reid's performance perhaps the movie could have worked but the plot is what dominates and the plot seems written by a 10 year old i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real time br br the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened he has amnesia of course in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something slater had to leave because he was too rebellious i guess you never really know unless it was in one of those voice overs i zoned out during the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities i may have the exact quote wrong but you get the idea br br there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth no reason given experiments on children super demon alien human hybrids photonic bullets the demon things can't stand sunlight and of course slater and dorf to try to save everyone br br jesus i can't even being to wade through the clichÃ©d elements the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth i mean why is this evil scientist so damn evil oh right humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race i guess he's infected how did that happen oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself how the hell did that happen why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes they use the old sci fi stand by of parasitic aliens demons which fuse with the spine of their host of course slater is like blade half super slug powered but his slug didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock thank god oh and the people with these fused spines have no idea they're half alien demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies yeah we get zombies br br so lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it is br br also the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle br br not the very worst thing you'll see but a truly bad movie
<START> i'm not sure if carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion and make the really heavy handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if satan is the father but it drags on and on ron perlman is laughable the baby is really stupid looking basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it you can pretty much see the material on the satan costume what a mess this episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium very very bad and the ending is just ridiculous after learning his baby is dead does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge bloody gory uproar no he just puts his head down and sulks out of the room terrible
<START> this film is one of the best shorts i've ever seen and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals i've seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best i'm not a fan of monaghan his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed this director really knows what she's doing of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who don't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what i've seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gem br br let's not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because that's certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasn't the fault of the filmmaker i saw this at a festival and the sound was fine i guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on mini dv then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawless br br nanavati can tell a story that much is clear she can write substance heavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound post production and 35mm instead of mini dv and even the trolls couldn't complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago she's done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i can't wait to see the higher budget stuff she's done 9 10 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker
<START> no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes don't begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldn't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding nemo jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent requests for replays
<START> this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful a beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film many changes have been made to the storyline presumably to streamline the timeframe but what results is simply confusing the acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior plus the conversion to english does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch esteban as esteban horrible please please please read the gorgeous novel in spanish if possible don't see this film it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience
