<START> after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed not because of the actors story or directing i was disappointed by this film advertisements br br the trailers were suggesting that the battalion have chosen the third way out other than surrender or die polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or german guns they even translated the title wrong as misplaced battalion this have tickled the right spot and i bought the movie br br the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies then i began to think hey this story can't be that simple i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops well he didn't they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen and so was i br br the story was based on real events of world war i so the writers couldn't make much use of their imagination but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring and as i wrote in the first place it isn't fault of actors writers or director their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with
<START> myra breckinridge is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent even from the people involved in making it this film was loathed from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do it's not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like showgirls br br undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra breckinridge is just plain mean as a hollywood satire it is cold blooded and mean spirited but in a hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesn't supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also viscously anti american and anti establishment and anti this and anti that but all in a superficial late 1960's trendy way like casino royale ski doo i love you alice b toklas and other would be hip epics myra is a middle aged vision of the hippy dippy youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles but instead of being cheerfully self mocking myra makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra breckinridge has the humor of a bully there's not a single moment of innocence in it its intentions aren't honorable time magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester but it's not nearly as sympathetic br br for instance poor mae west bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse the octogenarian star obviously didn't know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great grandsons but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady sutton andy devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy self parodies as is rex reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity hound jet setting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way but as myron myra's alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the joke br br you watch myra breckinridge and you don't see actors you see victims none more so than raquel welch no one will ever accuse welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered being in almost every scene welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west welch doesn't have to do much to strike a good balance even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was snubbed by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance br br the film's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film's agenda is the whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is anybody's guess with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind but as a feminist myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator besides myra isn't a woman rather she is a delusion of myron who presumably is a gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character's love hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead rusty but it doesn't explain his her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcett's mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading turning to gore vidal's original novel isn't of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie br br and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is wall to wall arcane references to old movies all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with a seething disdain he has raided the film vaults of 20th century fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist if you generously want to call sarne that make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally self defeating br br myra breckinridge doesn't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it in a very sad and sorry way myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto a celebration of pop culture nihilism
<START> i enjoyed this film perhaps because i had not seen any reviews etc it was delightful and a little bit of a 'romp' i don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did as far as the story goes i could relate to some aspects of the paul reiser character and i could see my dad in falk's character made me remember a lot of past times when i was a kid and listening to my grandparents too if you enjoyed movies like grumpy old men or on golden pond this is your movie a sleeper in my opinion and one of those feel good stories peter falk and paul reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles yet nothing was overdone i would say it rates at least an 8 perhaps higher
<START> this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u s it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is br br another good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the u s is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination br br a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder
<START> batman the mystery of the batwoman is about as entertaining as animated batman movies get br br while still true to the feeling of the comic books the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series bruce wayne looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less imposing the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy more youthful tim drake robin br br kevin conroy as usual invokes the voice of batman better than most live action actors br br kelly ripa did a much more decent voice acting job than i was expecting br br as in the live action batman films the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains my all time favorite the penguin is here his design is sleeker than it has appeared before hearkening more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the '60's than the danny devito portrayal of batman returns david ogden stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate just as he most commonly appears in the comics hector elizondo's voice creates a bane who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in batman robin and finally batman has a descent mystery to solve putting the detective back in detective comics that is what dc stands for after all the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist br br the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie it sounds like a mix between the score from poirot and the score from mission impossible all in all it's more entertaining than your average cartoon
<START> life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for but to be effective they must also be entertaining unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwell's 1984 first published in 1948 and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film br br watch or read it and then when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man reach for cinderella 2000 this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption there are many worse films appearing as dvd's these days and frankly i do not care much what happens either way br br so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the handmaiden's tale but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack london's towering novel the iron heel ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it imdb only lists a b w silent version made in russia in 1919
<START> when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting but thankfully i was mistaken from the moment i started watching it anime just pulled into the world of bread making i was hooked br br the biggest advantage of this anime is it's humor which is very intelligent and very funny with some recurring gags but the animation soundtrack and character development are below average while these disadvantages aren't seen so much in the first episodes because of the great job on this anime it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old and aren't as funny as before br br as far as i'm concerned if this anime had ended with episode 52 i would have given it a 9 but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste which sadly can't be washed away by the awesome 50 episodes br br 7 10
<START> mpaa rated r for violence language nudity and brief drug use quebec rating 13 canadian home video rating 18a br br i saw coonskin today this film is also known as bustin out and street fight after watching fritz the cat i wanted to see more of bashki's films i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this when it was first released the film was very controversial it was considered racist and al sharpton wanted the film banned he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing the film was only released on vhs under the title street fight it is now considered a cult classic film and african american celebrities such as comedian richard pryor director spike lee and the rap group the wu tang clan are said to have enjoyed this film i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well worth watching for bashki or blaxploitation film fans the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever the film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison while the prisoners wait the older one tells a story of three men he knew the film then switches into animation format we see three black men who sold their house to this man they decide to make names for themselves in harlem so the leader a black rabbit kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out the mafia involves the godfather his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out if you can find it
<START> warning it contains spoilers if a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie see for example 300 this one confirms the above lemma the second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times and this made more frustrated to compensate the consequent lack of suspense we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters and oh yes they have lots to show andy p hoffman for example is a drug addict more he is cheating his wife more he plans to rob his father more his wife is cheating with his brother more he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death more he is a serial killer more etc etc it's not enough space to write here i wonder how could he have a top job and why his wife didn't leave him before on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffman br br even here psh saves what is left from my 7 spent for this absurdity why absurdity because it doesn't have sense why should i care for the despicable characters another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic at least pleasant character br br also it's a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime
<START> i don't understand why people would praise this garbage its wrong stupid unrealistic awful and just about everything else the film is a view on life racial issues prejudice and everything else that strangely goes on in college this is where it fails it has no grasps on reality from many questionable non sense scenes in the movie such as for example br br a black man chasing down a white man with a gun the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them br br the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards br br as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymes br br another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters from the scared and confused white people and the mean angry and yet rightful black people its almost as its an insult to both black and white people i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race br br the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters one a black athlete the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex rape fights love hate prejudice racial war and oh yeah don't forget education which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out in which after they go back to their boring lives and think being white is bad does this sound alot like your college years didn't think so i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess br br overall this is a really bad bad ugly movie if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys just avoid this mess
<START> judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box br br to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants br br the film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculous br br one wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he is br br the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the story br br even there are several cringeworthy scenes br br direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced br br anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent
<START> i hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it aimed at an age group of 10 15 this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives
<START> i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger stallone and even van damme to certain degree he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career the strange thing about jill the ripper or jill rips or tied up is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb on the dvd case in the commentaries and this film is not serious to call it campy would be a huge understatement the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow confusing and gratuitous on top of that they put lundgren who is known for action films in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller just the plot and premise immediately make it a b movie porn at very best br br dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren danielle brett is lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain br br i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked to explain how classy and well done this movie is sarcasm sarcasm the back of the dvd i picked up it was really cheap has lundgren's character listed as murray wilson not the name of his character in the film while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it no one else should certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense 3 10
<START> claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing that the screen is cut off because there seems to be important actions going on but you cannot see them there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals br br i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work i can handle deep and slow movies but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully br br nothing to get attached to to any of the characters because they are not worked out well enough to work out characters more is needed than just minute long face shots at least with this set of script director actors br br i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors br br i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future br br what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history and for someone who spent time in shanghai
<START> yes it's flawed especially if you're into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you can't actually think for yourself br br roeg's films are for the intelligent film goer and insignificance is a perfect example br br the characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all nic roeg's films it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before his films always make you think and personally i like that in a film br br so don't expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy happy because it's likely you'll be disappointed br br but i think it's excellent
<START> hear are some of the interesting things our combat hero faith healer pat his son gordon t v ministry seems like a family business and terry meeuwsen won miss america in 1973 by wearing a

<START> greetings again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 9 11 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co stars as sandler's former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 9 11 br br of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writer director mike binder the upside of anger and sandler's accountant in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes don't work as well as others but overall it is well written and solidly directed br br sandler and cheadle are both excellent sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle br br support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith as cheadle's wife liv tyler as a very patient psychiatrist saffron burrows in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler's in laws br br the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde bruce springsteen and roger daltrey as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey not exactly a chipper upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story
<START> i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood the acting and story is simply pathetic the direction is awful i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap i bet the movie was made in less than a day i don't know what category it falls into please avoid this movie at all costs just do anything even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie
<START> the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed it's that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song there's an african japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you'll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
<START> citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo the ripper of rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no one untouched in the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds i can only say that next to the silence of the lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i've ever seen br br it is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation donald sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as rea's and what to say about jeffrey dumann playing the serial killer dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co workers he is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious br br i can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well made docu drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects it deserves at least a 9 10 perhaps even more if you ask me
