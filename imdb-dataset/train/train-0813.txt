<START> this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i've ever wasted an hour of my life on all i can say is thank god it was only an hour over half of this 'movie' is footage from the original criminally insane at the very least i was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic since for some reality defying reason my video store only has criminally insane ii as it had it crazy fat ethel ii but the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home video acting and backyard filmmaking you'll ever see why is it my video store has this and not the original why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they've seen its sheer horror why aauugghh why god why br br unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene or said fruit getting hung from the stair railing in an even slower scene or a character getting stabbed sideways don't ask multiple times in the back or brain cell murdering monologues about giving poisoned tea to one's wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one's own tea go cold or the mentally retarded eating fly soup or just simply want to see crazy fat ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden don't watch this movie repeat do not watch this movie do not rent this movie if at all possible do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it you can still be saved but it is too late for me now
<START> when it first came out this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema br br really at first we must say that this isn't really direct cinema it is more cinema veritÃ© the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation the meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed br br it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesn't want her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesn't want edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone br br but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women can't help be girls they cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the meysels and few others could do
<START> i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent often thrilling performance complete in every way pure too no synth no smoke shrouded lasers and strobes no grandiose entrance and an unstoned serious and appreciative audience all of whom left their bottle rockets at home br br if you're a cream fan or if you've only heard of them if you're a blues fan if you're a rock 'n' roll fan you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd you also will never lose this dvd because you'll never lend it to anyone this dvd justifies selfishness tell them to get their own it's too good and too replayable you'll want to keep it within easy reach
<START> karen sarah michelle gellar an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semi catatonic woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker yoko yoko maki disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in emma's home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goes br br maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of m night shyamalan's films but slower paced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek 2005 the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise 2005 the pacing tends to kill the film i didn't like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good film it earns a 9 out of 10 from me br br the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju on 2000 in particular it's extremely close to the first half of ju on the grudge aka ju on 3 from 2003 two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare br br director takashi shimizu also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju on series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewers scares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to film making although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju on series traditionally american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster a more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the u s br br however even if you're not used to it it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic ju on 3 good cinematography subtle production design touches check out gellar's clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma's house when gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror material br br even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture it's interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children br br i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichÃ©d mystery thriller territory with a here's what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10 br br now that i've said all of the above let me finish with a mini rant it's not that i'm anti remake but it is ridiculous that u s distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption the original versions of these films should just be playing in u s theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non white or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately i'd rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror films not just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etc at my multiplex in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more cost effective to do this as 1 you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and 2 you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions
<START> while a pleasant enough musical what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone as the has been composer and oscar levant as his assistant playing a high strung distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical sherlock holmes rathbone's character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help and that help is starbuck played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant upon hiring crosby's character as his ghost song writer rathbone introduces him to starbuck by saying he does all my thinking for me to which levant responds ah it's only a part time job of course this goes right past or over rathbone who's too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from as another reviewer said who knew rathbone could be so funny too bad he didn't have more opportunities to display his comedic talent
<START> i was bored around 10pm so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster br br it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesn't eat the worms then the world will end br br this is a good movie for little kids excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis' but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time
<START> peaceful rancher robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors that is until notorious outlaw robert preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field soon he begins to go too far feeding a growing sense of unease in sterling especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal br br the sundowners is a tightly paced gritty and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston here he comes across as an evil version of shane that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise br br rounding out the cast is chill wills jack elam and the debut of john drew barrymore who became more famous for his offspring than his acting
<START> a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter o'toole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter o'toole and susannah york get to overact
<START> what a terrible film it sucked it was terrible i don't know what to say about this film but dinocrap which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah sigh it's not roger corman that i hate it's this god awful movie well really but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics which is another thing the cgi sucked out loud i hate this movie dreadfully this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b movie and probably the gayest b movie too it's it's dinocrap i'm sorry i must have offended some nerds in these moments it's just an awful movie 0 1 000
<START> i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren i'm a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a rÃ©sumÃ© in a few sentences it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents the end you want an even shorter rÃ©sumÃ© boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said i'm a cultural barbarian
<START> this movie is one of the sleepers of all time i gave it a 10 rating the story is of the famed 'bushwhackers' out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states the clothing they wore were authentic the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted but not bad for hollywood the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them i suspect it was a combination of great directing super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors not just one or two this movie really jelled it has action romance suspense good guys and bad guys sometimes depending on your individual perspective and history all rolled into one movie even has the future spiderman and jewel and she's good
<START> this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself a successful actor pushing 70 he has traveled to a small rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play as a manager of such a place he soon beguiles the staff and the customers especially the lovely if cranky young woman paz vega who presides over the 10 items or less checkout lane br br 10 items or less doesn't have a big statement to make and doesn't pretend that it does it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly and as the older man offers his counsel in exchange for a ride home the movie company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can't call for help i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me
<START> at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15 000 votes it has a 5 8 rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a 10 i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than it's share of awards won 3 oscars another 5 wins 26 nominations right there tells me it's better than a 5 8 some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy caprice
<START> miriam hopkins is the lady with red hair in this 1940 biopic of mrs leslie carter which also stars claude rains as david belasco richard ainley as lou payne and a fine cast of supporting players including laura hope crews and victor jory br br miriam hopkins and claude rains give wonderful performances hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for mrs carter rains is great as the flamboyant egotistical producer writer actor impresario david belasco one of the great names in theater br br though mrs carter's second husband lou payne served as adviser on this film it's a poor representation of the real events of mrs carter's life true there was a much publicized and bitter divorce and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress however she had custody of her son dudley so there was no custody battle once she broke with belasco she did not go back to him and in fact started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life she did indeed marry lou and he became her leading man in many productions br br the driving force for mrs carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son but she finally realizes that in her time away from him he is thoroughly bonded with his father in the film also and i'm not sure if it was true in real life she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere br br not a bad movie probably not a depiction of the greatness of either carter or belasco one of mrs carter's most famous moments was in the heart of maryland where she wore a wig with six foot tresses off stage fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing quite a visual
<START> it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was 80 of let's face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career relaunch then i think it might never happen with this on their cv the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest br br i'm sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it's a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
<START> this period melodrama is one of griffith's earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escape br br griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms Â the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cote's back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined br br the second technique on display here is the cross cutting anyone with an interest in griffith's work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention however what makes griffith's cross cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow step by step pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one by one as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall br br at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross cut the dramatic ride to the rescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffith's pictures
<START> shower keeps within itself in so many ways almost all of the movie takes place in an old time bathhouse with the denizens supplying the humor pathos and emotional touches the love and friendship between the proprietor and his retarded son is deep and moving the way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive the plot is meandering full of surprises and ironies and touched overall by a sense of what i'd have to call neighborliness in the relations and conflicts of the performers this is a film i pull out when i want to believe in the world again
<START> look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come Â robert de niro br br this was initially a film for steven spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro like jurassic park poltergeist and war of the worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial br br in typical spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins like oscar schindler robin williams sam niel tom cruise and virtually every daddy figure in spielberg land the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys br br but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese's filmography and ironically his most illuminating br br an artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing exposing the inner workings of their art when the story doesn't work the characters don't connect or the images don't sear we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core this Â the remaining carcass is what the director's cinema is about br br now cape fear is an impersonal film so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese's filmography you already sacrificed me de niro yells but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter what the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on watch how scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention but more importantly watch how the film makes no spatial sense a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment br br the reason for this is that scorsese's camera always has to be bound or intimately tethered to his central character for the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character resnais can take you around a french hotel welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building cameron can give you a tour of the titanic scott can recreate an entire future cityscape lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close up mid shot wide shot combinations but scorsese can't do this there's no poetry no sense of tangible space in his films he's all about the character you break that tether you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everything collapses he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting which in a way is a prerequisite for action film making br br scorsese tried to rectify this problem with gangs of new york where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis the actor drawing scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb br br 5 10 Â even as a generic b movie this is an ugly vulgar looking film look at the matte paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ gives the film its only great scene in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her a kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both aroused and repelled by this man's interest br br but de niro's performance so deliciously over the top simply can't be imitated by scorsese you'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work but scorsese nope br br worth one viewing
<START> if you are a fan of zorro indiana jones or action in general this is a must see directed by republic's ace team of william witney and john english and starring reed hadley as don diego zorro this serial delivers i won't bore you with the plot who cares less talking more fighting what really matters here is hadley's superb interpretation of the character s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt br br stunt spoilers follow br br you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter trapped on a rope bridge a'la temple of doom in another does a raiders horse to coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom in addition to all this the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains swings to safety etc with his trusty lash most of the sword work is fair to lame except for chapter one which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword stunt legend ralph faulkner who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez this was the first serial i ever saw on matinÃ©e at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since br br zorro's fighting legion delivers z goods
<START> another fun witty frothy rko musical with astaire and rogers follow the fleet is a charming film while it lacks the stand out great tunes of swng time although the final number face the music and dance is one of the team's best and rightfully so it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene while there are better fred and ginger musicals this is certainly a must see
