<START> i really enjoyed this movie typically ron howard who seems to like being associated with michael keaton love the scene when hunt travels to japan with his sales pitch whoa how did that get in there cheap laughs but great value
<START> this cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters especially of course the two leading characters jack lemmon plays felix a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails walter matthau plays oscar his friend an untidy unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment he offers his distressed friend felix a new home in his apartment and soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time felix turns oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat he cleans and cooks the whole time after a short while oscar feels persecution mania filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted above all jack lemmon's play is wonderful he is the perfect clown he makes us laugh but in a tragi comic way look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling ball while he is preparing the drinks felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room to get out of this embarrassing situation he starts to talk about the weather a minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children suddenly he begins to weep and when oscar comes back with the drinks there are three weeping people in the living room the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes an intelligent entertaining comedy with much heart 10 out of 10
<START> pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment big dummy that i am plot is so complex that i still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed that scene alone is worth the price of admission this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond no one should miss this picture
<START> i'm a huge fan of war movies and as a vietnam combat vet have some experience with the technical details i worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them other vets and iraq vets in particular have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well poetic license is one thing but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it no bomb disposal unit or any unit would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason it saves lives the opening scene particularly annoyed me the guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately yelling stop dialing is not an effective deterrent it got worse from there the scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious as others have noted your average eod guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper and to think any arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination kidnapping an arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen somebody might shoot him but this kind of risk taking is limited to the movies i could go on but as i said others have pointed these things out in detail this is not a good movie and if it wins any awards at all it's a further reflection of why la la land is so named
<START> really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement br br this vampire's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampire's hunters net ok but he work alone he's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isn't alone br br you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i don't recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events br br i deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc br br 3 10
<START> the performances in this movie were fantastic the dialogue was great jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as kid collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel far superior to the grifters which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction film noir roots from which the story came i recommend this movie to all film noir fans
<START> watching marlen brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany brando's acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable the plot is inane and laughable not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful the director throws freeze frame and slow motion shots about with impunity the incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect it's not something i really look for in a movie but even the wardrobe was way off the venerable brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in i've heard this movie called david lynch esquire and irreverently funny it is neither david lynch films are borne of wicked creativity this film was in no way creative and don't confuse irreverence with stupidity
<START> there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place nothing looks rehearsed the film quality is terrible most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' as they deliver their lines no tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible even 'manos' fares better than this at least they had proper equipment what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess br br stick to home videos preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy's new camera phone you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this
<START> interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to however i'll try this was a very good action film with some great set pieces you'll note i specified the genre i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation and i didn't berate the acting enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but i've made my comment
<START> unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence br br forget you ever stumbled upon this film and go watch something else br br but if you insist on reading consider br br lame vehicle for japanese teen idol pretty boys featuring nonsensical convoluted plot that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream br br nothing in this film makes sense it's an endless series of people expressing various emotions from joy to anger from happiness to tragedy for no good reason we can obviously see something incredibly dramatic is happening but we just don't give a crap why 'cause there's no backstory br br by the time this film is over you will be sick and tired of these stupid lanky girly stars' faces you'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile sneer cry look mysterious be serious and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces br br that some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the soul of any of its actors should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you br br only the converted mindless minions will like this film the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous freud would have a field day br br unless you're one of these mindless fans stay the hell away from this abomination
<START> hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler jon voigt and his lame con man sidekick dustin hoffman soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills br br a daring film for its time and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s symbolic of the end of innocence in american films since it was the only x rated film to win a best picture oscar br br jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk befriended by a lame con man dustin hoffman he goes through a series of serio comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida a land his friend ratzo dreams of living in br br but even in this final quest the two are losers john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt and john barry's haunting midnight cowboy theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation br br summing up a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life
<START> very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment br br the script was very good as was the acting the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending br br i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever br br this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good
<START> haven't seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much forgotten br br maybe because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical drama br br always reckon that 50 of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to disprove that am i right or wrong
<START> i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953 br br i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia loren's early work i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess surely today this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making it actually became annoying watching ms loren in skin color paint throughout the film br br yes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight br br as beautiful as ms loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage after all we don't see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain do not discount the success of using heavy weight opera singers one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j g wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date br br the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality the color ink has faded much and that can not be helped br br to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we who do not speak italian can know what the lyrics are saying it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes br br watch this film not because of the story of aida nor the fact that this is an opera aside from ms sofia loren none of her co actors are known nor remembered by this writer instead watch this movie if you are a fan of ms loren and wish to see her at age 19 no matter what the production is br br larry from illinois
<START> i'm sorry to all the fans but this is a useless movie the acting is bad even wooden it over hypes the fright factor early on and doesn't exactly work i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing what the hell the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted try again br br its hardly original and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher and that's saying something br br i think whoever did the castings whoever wrote the script and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported br br don't watch this movie if someone puts this on at a party throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie like silence of the lambs or the shining
<START> as the jacket proclaims this film is gorgeously shot and masterfully edited and yes it is mesmerizingly beautiful the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity br br and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in or in the words of matthew arnold from dover beach br br listen you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return up the high strand begin and cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of sadness in br br at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that words do their job but what i'm doing here says a lot more as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates is indeed something more than mere words can say br br at another point he remarks on what is here to stay and what isn't that is his theme br br i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral the idea was that by emphasizing how short lived are even the mightiest works of humans a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed br br perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality br br both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along br br this is art as art should be akin to the spiritual br br in a sense goldsworthy's work is an inarticulated understanding it is an experience purely of time and form in a sense his work answers shelley's famous poem ozymandias by saying even as the tide washes the work away and even as the river dissipates the expression even so the art lives on because of our experience of it similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished they are given to the wind so that we might know that all is flux br br yet in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer of necessity i would say and all his works even the unsuccessful ones he tells us are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not br br this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual
<START> when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co stars you expect to find a well done horror movie but this was actually quite different representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction karloff and lugosi both play scientists rukh and benet respectively competitors to an extent until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory the science here was to say the least a bit rough around the edges thus science fiction with the emphasis on the fiction but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth several thousand million years ago in that pre historic time a huge meteorite slammed into africa leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call radium x which can heal and destroy a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa on a search for the meteorite deposits which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well br br karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing especially during the scenes set in africa the story also plodded along a bit and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me given that this is really a sci fi rather than a horror flick and that sci fi was in its very early stages i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack it was ok nothing more but also nothing less than that 4 10
<START> i rented end game having never heard of it but i'm fond of political thrillers so i thought i'd give it a shot after doing some research on the movie i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to dvd after seeing it i'm thinking no wonder the movie is shocking in its unoriginality the plot and the characters are perfunctory i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball i have to say i didn't expect it to end quite the way it did but that's not a point in its favor the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse br br stay away i want the 5 98 and my 107 minutes back
<START> some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel the postman always rings twice' on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the 1946 us version also entitled postman' br br even better is this gem from italy which i have read was mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter Â what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neo realist movement in film making one can certainly see why Â despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in life br br consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless br br in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner giuseppe bregana played by juan de landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her br br on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed gino wins bregana's favor promising also to fix the broken water pump Â water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affair br br gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named spagnolo a fellow train passenger to gino spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends spagnolo also symbolizes gino's morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady employment to his dismay he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go back home' to live and work with them again as he is handy to have around br br too weak willed to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to gina's demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her Â he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences br br i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds Â that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the story br br while the '46 u s version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live br br a minor quibble the amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the u s version gino's very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer hooker Â they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met Â all rather unrealistic isn't it i found this time frame problem quite distracting Â it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewer's time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended
<START> one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800's what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800's but if you have a choice do not see this movie
