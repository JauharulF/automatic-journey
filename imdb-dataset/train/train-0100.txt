<START> this movie sucks from beginning till especially the end you probably don't get 'm any worse acting storyline photography camera work etcetera it's all bad very very bad br br but that's what makes it a 'great' watch it will give you more than enough good laughs the worse the better br br i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie a serious viking movie the story is goddamn ridiculous it's more like a comedy in disguise kinda like mafia also pointless but damn funny br br and look out for the very very end of the movie uhum
<START> the film starts out very slowly with the lifestyle of wallace napalm an attendant at a photo service drop off station his wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes firefighting seriously br br as we watch wallace's rather dull life proceeding suddenly there comes something new and jarring a traveling carnival comes to town one of its stars is wilder napalm wallace's brother he's a clown but he has a special talent br br so does wallace they're both pyrokineticists or pyrotics people capable of starting fires through mental energy wallace keeps his powers secret wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do br br spoiler some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant wallace holds back from using his powers wilder wants to go public on national tv br br complicating the matter wilder wants wallace's wife whom they both dated years earlier she becomes a bone of contention and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefight br br the film is entertaining but not laugh out loud funny i think enough of it to have a copy in my library it's a good offbeat film
<START> disappointing predictable film in which a woman mc teer travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness in this genre 'anywhere but here' starring susan sarandon and natalie portman gave a much better insight into a mother daughter relationship with better acting as well
<START> tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite there's a bit of subtext that might be about france's colonial past but it's mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers sadly that doesn't happen here it looks good and the acting is fine and there's nothing really wrong with the concept but it's just so smug god does this movie love itself pity it isn't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is the only impetus in the show sorry movie comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this that's right just like in a sitcom which is what this is with the added 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a 110 minute running time
<START> one shot one kill no exceptions a must see if you are into marines or snipers two big thumbs up great overall storyline great camera work good drama action details and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans
<START> sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attack br br such amazing 3 songs in promo dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss br br music wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like 'bachchan bachchan pandey ' br br overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english br br go away man i need to puke
<START> not being familiar with us television stations when i flicked onto this on my in laws' cable first i thought it was just a low budget sci fi film then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist and then it dawned on me good grief these people are serious it's been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers but then i saw other reviews and thought hey they can take it tough philosophical conundrum how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you're criticizing answer make it in such a way that the only people who'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're criticizing i suppose some liberals ugh spit when you say that might be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the j c myth but i didn't mind it was so darn funny
<START> i'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film but i can't understand how this one got made who made it how could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film did they do a weekend course at some film school get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap david badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it or was he by any chance a longtime family friend distant relation doing this out of sheer misplaced kindness i don't care don't want to know even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera meanwhile the dop must have been the gaffer from neighbours there seemed to be absolutely no sound design the script the direction and editing were all abysmal and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that i can't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film
<START> i fell asleep on my couch at 7 35pm last night watching larry sanders i usually directivo it but not last night woke up at 3am invesment banker on the west coast and was fascinated to see this on hbo2 i was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was seriously shocked so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb this is really really bad the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school br br yes it is shot video mind you that is shot on video not digital video it does look like a soap opera the clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror br br i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything the shots and blocking are stupid yes i chose the word 'stupid' not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid i know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example i cant it was 3am but trust me i know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews br br
<START> like others i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho mythology of the participants to the crime including capote himself as to capote i cannot forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith's confessions intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels i believe truths and facts capote reserved for his book which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule capote himself could never write another major literary work after in cold blood shame and guilt in my opinion he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book drama to him both men had to die for his book to succeed the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment his actions and silence assured that ice cold conclusion br br capote's book is not truth it is not factual or journalistic it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote's mind which may have been the most cold blooded aspect of all no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake's performance that actor is the nightmare from capote's dishonest imaginings br br so who is to say how the two killers should be played who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to do it now killing i agree with the few who see in eric roberts' work a magnificent performance shakespearean in its range yet played with heartbreaking sincerity anthony edwards takes a much safer attitude mode to create a smarmy hickok but he is one dimensional and boring with only a few notes in his television range roberts is almost four dimensional adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do like leopold apropos loeb robert's perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man without hickok or a man of his particularities perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life br br given the freedom from capote's death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama same facts some of the same lines from the case record but deeper more complex with clearly titanic psychotic stresses indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is br br what many of our reviewers dislike about this film roberts in particular is that cold blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic interpretation of life and death than capote could ever create a real tragedy br br the actual cold blooded killer mr capote and his hypocritically artistic non fiction novel do not control these interpretations and performances br br if in cold blood and capote's effect on life literature and truth matters as much as scholars say then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth or a version of the truth that is not the rank cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote's own abyss
<START> this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it's a very enjoyable light hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for it's feel good factor alone ok so frank sinatra's acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago
<START> new york has never looked so good and neither has anyone in this movie while the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it you almost wish people like this really existed the appeal of the actors are what really put it over john ritter colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did
<START> this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decent but i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jean baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life br br i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion
<START> a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies its full of no name actors and actresses with little valuable plot br br anyway this strange game goes on and our hero bets real money and does good at it it is sort of like gambling except the gambling part is gone and it sucks instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good br br what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition br br overall not even worth a 1 rental borrow it please d
<START> it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was consequently they had even more trouble delivering it they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub atomic particles having established a fuzzy picture of heisenberg's uncertainty principle they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers positive thinking interrupting bad patterns always look on the bright side etc next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins hormones which we more or less choose to create if you are sad you will create sad proteins if you are happy you will create happy proteins it's just so simple isn't it interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda a photographer who pops anti depressants and hates her thighs the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say hey amanda just cheer up why can't she cheer up obviously it's because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion that's why the conclusion of the film which is basically the entire second half brought on a barrage of contradiction we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings but a collective consciousness but we are individuals who can change the world but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions but we can choose who we are and we have a purpose to do good but there is no god because there is nothing better than us so there is no such thing as right and wrong so there is no such thing as reward or punishment so nothing good ever came out of religion but we should still do good anyway even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate and then crime will cease and if we say nice things our water will freeze into pretty shapes still with me good because there is more according to robert l park in his book voodoo science the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington d c was a farce the numbers were doctored and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight br br so does all this work or not i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse one of the film's three directors yes three fielded questions following the show i call myself lucky because i had first hand confirmation that these people don't know what they are talking about several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband a chiropractor had to step in and recite the answer i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political and everyone including ms chasse began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie
<START> the movie's storyline is pat and quaint two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves unfortunately if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central asia this is absolutely terrible br br the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it to begin with and most glaringly incorrect the nuristanis as they were known in the thirties and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by abdul rahman shah of aghnaistan were not nomads in fact they have not been nomads since the aryan invasions of central asia over three milenia ago br br second the city that is filmed as tehran is not tehran which is understandable however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly different than the city of tehran which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range which predominates all of the cities views br br third persian despite the fact it is spoken in iran and afghanistan is never heard in movie when there are native speakers who do not speak in german they speak in arabic the 'persian' guards at the border in fact say to each other 'ma hadha rujal' this is not a man and not 'in mard nist' as it would be in persian also the love song between the indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in spanish while talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the quran uses the words 'ferdos' and 'jehaan' and makes some reference to drugs afterwords these words certainly never appear in the quran as they are persian for paradise indeed ferdos and paradise are very distant cognates between our languages and 'world' respectively though jehaan is admittedly close to 'jehennan' which is hell in arabic when they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also arabic this despite the fact that there are no native speakers of arabic in iran and afghanistan and its use is primarily religious with some use in education at that time br br when they are stopped in iran before they reach the afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any iranian group their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile in iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear turbans unless they are a cleric the language spoken is clearly arabic from the initial greeting of 'ahlan wa sahlan ' when they do reach kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the hindu kush mountain range there is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring the area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name the indian killers because of its difficult and limiting ground br br in short the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place it lacks any real draw to it being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to nuristan however even that is still born and no real development is felt leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose in short this is a really bad movie that i would have rated at one star except for the good footage of bedouin and the deserts of the levant even if they are misnamed
<START> daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way don't you think he's a little old for her br br things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an over protective neat freak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really don't like this movie is because i can't stand to see juhi my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening br br anyway all i'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else
<START> i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous ex baseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesn't testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while she's not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobia's and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russell's best performance and i probably wouldn't argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoo's nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
<START> i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write br br i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary it did what it set out to do show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it for competition the catty folks the complainers even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat the jealous it's all there like in every other competition like every other competition like it which i felt was a point br br you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete it was that important to them then there was sad stories stories of who's house and house mother brought out the best and the brightest in competition it was interesting br br now to add after 10 years of seeing this film i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her vogue phase and rightfully so if not for those individuals madonna wouldn't have had a vogue phase i know that now credit should be given where credit is due makes me wonder if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary they'll learn they're not as mainstream as they think
<START> slight spoilers br br a hunchback 15 year old boy kisses a very cute 15 year old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time after the act he lays in the bed with her not touching her the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years br br this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency br br however as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15 year old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother br br at one point his mother preaches to her co workers who are not as understanding as they might be every step of the way in this my son has been amazing i have never been more proud of him br br the young father's older sister who otherwise is cold towards her brother begins to show pride in her sibling you have been cool about this as she gives him an encouraging warm hug br br the 15 year old father wants to be a father he wants to be a parent br br why not we see the new baby a few minutes after birth it appears to be a healthy happy 4 month old infant just as babies were born on tv in the 1960's and 1970's br br once the young father is a parent he has found happiness he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper we see the 15 year old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy body mother is peaking over his shoulder fade to black
