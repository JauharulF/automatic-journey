<START> flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored this is an intelligent and complex film beautifully realized and Â surprise Â pretty damn accurate this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this after a fruitless attempt to escape she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent br br flavia is a downright mesmerizing film almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer feminism more intensely than flavia does several sequences are quite shocking on the verge of nightmarish actually as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes torture and mutilation yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds mind you i'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'flavia' is trying to communicate humanity the catholic church in particular historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further films like flavia the heretic have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography the glorious costumes scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's marÃ­a casares who steals the show as sister agatha she's a man hating and loud mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field amen sister
<START> a memorable line from a short lived show after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense instead of ready break our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show using this line added a unique element to our season that i'll never forget we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech
<START> as a lover of the surreal in art and film i was pleased to discover this film on ifc it is definitely a keeper most of the other reviews tell the general plot not all correct so i won't bother to bore anyone with that the main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by ana's impending illness and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so alone and finally with her family which i believe is still at least a little troubled it only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy with a little hint of coming of age only because ana is a pre teen who hates boys i heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination
<START> to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it's set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta young's she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband's plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they're not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies br br there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there's now a law against selling an example of her repartee be careful farrell it's too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment br br the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is
<START> the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyk's performance the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today bette midler's version is much more interesting she is stella claire an independent free spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend stephen collins or her friend john goodman in an underrated performance she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life altering decision through out the film there are plenty of laughs tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado marsha mason co stars as jenny's would be stepmother who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her if you like midler goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy bette midler's version of stella
<START> dr tarr's torture dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients however the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be and the asylum is being run by the patients and the doctors are in cages first of all some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons a guy who thinks he's a chicken for instance i have to admit that the story is actually pretty good but the film itself bombs the music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy and yes there is a scene involving dancing chicken men which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen watch this film at your own risk br br rated r for violence and nudity
<START> god what an awful thing oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something see the terrible use of music and pictures here but what for really the whole thing behind natural born killers seems to be a clever look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself please mr stone next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates avoid doing the same with your movie michael haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways how true only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap
<START> i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon i have to admit that i've never been a big baseball fan but i can sometimes get into a good sports related movie what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family biological parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heart wrenching and heart melting joseph gordon levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances maybe it was just my emotional state but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film
<START> this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection 'comics underground japan' and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt cheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell what's going on the dvd of this has director's commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them i'm giving this a 8 10 for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this
<START> i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it i t is not a mindless movie like leathal weapon part 58 you know the one where riggs is really crazy it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened br br don't let your doggy take a shower
<START> i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive dvd video laserdisc collection so luckily i didn't personally have to pay for it i had an inkling that it would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldn't play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad br br solar crisis is bad but it doesn't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at br br anyway the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it in order to counter act this imminent threat humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun which through some convoluted sci fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle leaving earth unharmed br br never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek even with an ensemble cast charlton heston peter boyle and jack palance solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts simple yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on br br the crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by boyle who insists on sabotaging the mission through means that are never explained he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crew's genetically engineered scientist played by female lead annabel schofield why is he sabotaging the mission because by his moronic viewpoint he believes the flare won't happen and that when it doesn't he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market in effect you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable br br the film's plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages and i would only succeed in losing your interest but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the film br br anyway the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed sci fi jargon back and forth at each other yes i know they already do that but imagine if that's all they did and that they used said jargon to set up vague and near nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement tension or interest in the viewer whatsoever br br this is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zero g environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion but doesn't bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs nor why he can't really escape in totality you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable br br then we have several scenes where dramatic build up leads to nothing jack palance's performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero don't ask around the desert before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits on his death bed palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball which he kept quiet about before colonel travis j richards the boy repeats it quietly after he expires giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film perhaps charlton heston's grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated something anything br br nope sorry any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic failed attempts at creating dramaÂfor a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palance's career just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred br br completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain's spell a climax which features another of the film's considerably well done visual effects sequences that even for the visibly elaborate care put into them still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle heston and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over acting br br grade d
<START> i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles dickens' classic novel that i have seen so far george c scott's performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge i've seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one br br what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie br br this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece this is the best version of a christmas carol period br br 10 10
<START> this was a classic case of something that should never have been gloria was now a single mother her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie bunker's right winged philosophies the series went on but it just didn't have any pizazz whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone maybe if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family it might have worked out ah well that's show business
<START> this movie is a total dog i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money and my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies br br they should have saved the money on getting d list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role br br this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was including the subplots after viewing this movie i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite like humor where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead
<START> i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and it's also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s it's impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but it's not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it
<START> ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional i got this game april 2007 two years after release and i am still impressed with the gameplay it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games br br i give this game 10 10 for the levels it contains especially the consulate level i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level it was too much pressure on the whole i like the game a lot
<START> have you ever in your life gone out for a sport's activity tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it where for a brief moment you were given a chance to be a hero and a champion and failed i believe many of us have had that moment in our lives this is the premise of the movie the best of times in this story a middle age banker named jack dundee robin williams suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake which happened years ago is inspired to re play the game again in order to accomplish this he must convince the once great football quarterback reno hightower kurt russell to make a comeback for reno who is satisfied with his present lot in life see's no need to change the past record which get's better as he ages added to both their problem is the fact years have passed and in addition both their marriages are floundering and in need of re vamping not easy when his father in law donald moffat habitually reminds him of the biggest drop nevertheless dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the greatest blunder of his life great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again
<START> there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video this one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential amy adams am oscar nominee and talented actress robin dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent and sarah thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas the film is also misstated this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that this was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay per view masturbation films fortunately for the actors hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes so if you are looking to see something naughty but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter
<START> i'm a male not given to women's movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner
<START> one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner br br first we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in 1938 a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills' waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining
