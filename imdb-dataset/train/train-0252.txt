<START> riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one this series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one though br br we're back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital mrs drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate want's it otherwise she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdom br br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones it's well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first series br br the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast they are all very good it's an odd story and setting some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectly br br much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact the cinematography is one of those qualities the hand held camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch br br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first also be prepared to see some more i didn't think that green thing looked all too good thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good the non digital effects looks good too little brother looks just really odd but you accept it all over i'd say effects are from ok to good br br the music is also quite good moody and nice some of it are really touching it fits really nice as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well br br all together this makes a good sequel if you'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed it has many of the same qualities as the first series however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this these two makes up a series you don't wanna miss
<START> why should you watch this there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis their life was certainly an amusing one edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats one was named ted z kennedy the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad edith died shortly after the film was released in february 1977 aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in 1925 and is still living in miami beach this film is both engaging and spellbounding
<START> clever gritty witty fast paced sexy extravagant sleazy erotic heartfelt and corny footlight parade is a first class entertainment what the movies are all about br br the realistic satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today especially considering that realism has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema br br this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh self referential critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age i'd recommend watching any film from this period that is 1930 1935 for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be
<START> action horror sci fi exploitation director fred olen ray shows he has some talent as a director character actor william smith is one of the best tough bad guys in the industry he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career as for randy travis he gives his best lee van cleef impression he's not bad in the film smith and travis make the movie as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out ray did a great job directing this flick smith and travis were good i'd give this b western on a scale of one to ten ten being the best a seven
<START> castle in the sky is undoubtedly a hayao miyazaki film after seeing it for the first time i'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint on the contrary you get your time's worth which means as to what miyazaki's films are concern that is nothing less than excellent br br produced early in his cinematic career castle in the sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies with strong but young female characters forced to grow up due to external circumstances helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters and of course the usual battle of nature versus civilization flying machines lots of it beautiful painted sceneries Â but alas no pigs at least that i've noticed after all i have only seen it once never the less miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier with nausicÃ£a which was a dress rehearsal for princess mononoke his magnum opus castle in the sky is set a bit a part from these two with a soft action packed first 30 minutes resembling his tv series conan and his directed episodes of meitantei holmes in here we are introduced to sheeta a girl who literally falls from the sky only to be found by pazu a young boy working in a little countryside mining town intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of laputa pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates as the movie progresses the plot gets heavier and much more interesting revealing myiazaki at his best br br the sound track is very reminiscent of spirited away or vice versa as castle in the sky was produced first and much like its director joe hisaishi the composer starts with a very light score that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward br br a note to the english dubbing with a good interpretation from the two lead stars although anna paquin's sheeta has a very thick accent which the actress still had at that point in her career and a heads up for mark hamil as muska making up for a delighting yet devilish villain br br don't miss this one people
<START> i find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film making prowess to pull it off br br the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror br br the surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon' a scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirrel eating albino br br part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the 'intentional' the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough wrap scene' blur hopelessly br br take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary br br while we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'dark stranger' who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already 'man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain' and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater br br i generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks br br the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and i'd file messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it's not particularly gory trashy or sleazy
<START> joyce reynolds seems a might grown up for the role of janie a boy crazy sixteen year old in small town america who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier and winds up on the cover of life magazine smooching at a blanket party all in the same week non stop barrage of wisecracks put downs bull talk and unfunny bits of business such as janie's little sister bribing family members hattie mcdaniel as the maid constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis janie's mother involved with the red cross and janie's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today's teenagers as the parents stuffy sexless edward arnold and pert chatty ann harding make an unlikely couple even for 1944 he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them nominated for an academy award for owen marks' editing warner bros followed this in 1946 with janie gets married reynolds must have outgrown her co horts by then she was replaced by joan leslie 1 2 from
<START> letting the class watch this in english was a bad idea films that are serious and more educational can have an effect but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class whenever the teacher left conversations quickly started and i didn't hear the words shakespeare or tempest being used at all and when you look at this it is easy to see why the acting is nothing special everyone seems bored to bits just reading from the page without a care in the world shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death but i just couldn't understand a word anyone was saying the costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects the class may not have loved the film but they weren't exactly taking the p ss either but it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy the scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren't too badly done though the rain looked a bit unrealistic everything else was done well and good but where were the severed heads and exploding masts where was the death where was the inspiration the character of ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes but as all was on show he was just another excuse for a joke this film is not in any way appealing to either sex the women and girls won't have any romance or comedy to enjoy and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off the tempest wasn't badly done but this felt like something the producers had to make not something they wanted to make and the general boredom and lack of inspiration show 3 10
<START> except for jon heder this guy tanked the entire movie br br the plot sounded entertaining a 29 year old slacker son heder still lives with widowed mom keaton who happens to meet a new love daniels slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship he also meets a girl faris br br i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach heders performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me
<START> i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second br br i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening br br i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years
<START> i just saw this film i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end so i watched it like 10 minutes ago and i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne marie because she said 'i love you charlie' and also 'i'll miss you charlie' just made me really cry ha ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha ha thats all i can say xd br br but i love this film its a true classic br br xx maverick xx 10 10
<START> verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party really gore in the second part this movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget i hope that the director will make another one
<START> when we talk hollywood hotel we could be talking about one of three things the actual hotel the radio program and this film which was partially inspired by the first two dick powell was the host of the hollywood hotel program on cbs radio network in which louella parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars br br powell and parsons debuted the hollywood hotel program in 1934 so by 1937 it had its fair share of the radio audience powell hosted sang and kibitzed with louella and her movie star guests with the power she had with her column she was able to get the various stars to go on and plug their latest films for nothing br br then the american federation of radio artists stepped in and demanded she pay wages accordingly and they won the case that ended the hollywood hotel program in 1938 of course both powell and louella went on to other radio venues the whole story is covered in the tony thomas book the films of dick powell br br but before the plug was pulled this film came out from powell's home studio of warner brothers inspired by the radio program powell plays a singer saxophonist with the benny goodman band who gets signed to a hollywood contract but when he gets out to hollywood he gets himself tangled up with an egotistical film star lola lane her lookalike double real life sister rosemary lane and a ham actor in alan mowbray br br when mowbray is called upon to sing in a civil war epic he's making with lola lane it's powell's voice they use then mowbray develops a lina lamont problem when he's asked to go on the hollywood hotel radio program broadcast from the hollywood hotel that's got the studio in a tizzy let's say the problem isn't solved the way it is singing in the rain but powell's manager ted healy proves to be resourceful br br richard whiting and johnny mercer provide a really nice score for the film the big hit song comes right at the beginning as the benny goodman band with scat singing johnnie davis sing hollywood's anthem hooray for hollywood my favorite however is powell and rosemary lane singing i'm like a fish out of water just listening to johnny mercer's lyrics about ginger rogers running the brooklyn dodgers or sally rand without her fan it's a compendium of american popular culture in the thirties br br busby berkeley does the choreography here and while the film doesn't have the soaring imaginary stuff that his earlier work with warner brothers has the numbers are well staged berkeley's big moment is in a drive in eatery where powell and healy have been forced to take jobs the number starts with benny goodman broadcasting from the hollywood hotel doing let that be a lesson to you and then at the drive in powell lane and the entire place start joining in song to the exasperation of owner edgar kennedy and you know what you can expect from edgar kennedy exasperation br br benny goodman gets to show why he was named the king of swing when the band with drummer gene krupa and xylophonist lionel hampton as part of his ensemble that together with frances langford singing as well and possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a fellow who had a small bit as a radio announcer he died in 2004 but not before he became the 40th president of the united states ronald reagan always credited dick powell and pat o'brien as being the two guys on warner brothers who were the most helpful to an eager young player looking to make his mark br br hollywood hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture dated but charmingly so
<START> well if you are one of those katana's film nuts just like me you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick br br starring tadanobu asano vital barren illusion ryu daisuke kagemusha this samurai war between heiki's clan versus genji's clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at gojo bridge the body count is countless br br demons magic swords shinto priests versus buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro sogo ishii will do the rest br br a good japanese flick for a rainy summer night
<START> with knightly and o'tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or not the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements
<START> the last command 1928 is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg it shows us czarist general grand duke sergius alexander emil jannings in his days of glory in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing he also had the love of a woman natalie dabrova evelyn brent about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution his old enemy lev andreyev william powell is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not the last command is very good silent drama emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead william powell is great as always there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie like many scenes with jannings and brent and then there is the ending with powell and jannings this is a movie that touches in many parts
<START> not even timothy hutton or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film for starters the script was definitely written to be made into a b film but somehow duchovny looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television and hutton looking for the two of a one two punch he had hoped would define his career after ordinary people became attached to the picture cheesy lines big bad wipes from scene to scene come on who uses wipes after 12th grade telecommunications class and plain old bad acting sink this film even duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film only timothy hutton rises above the material at all i must admit feeling duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice over while i found myself laughing when i'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of duchonvey's voice over if you ever need a doctor be sure to call 911 if only the studio had called 911 this dog of a motion picture would never have been made avoid at all costs br br
<START> a blair witch war movie that is as much of a letdown as bwitch was the title says it all save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as once upon a time in america the shawshank redemption or enemy at the gates if you want to watch a great war movie etc br br this movie if it were a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and single a was the rookies then this movie was high school ball it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera sure they went into a hostile area to make a film but i don't call that brave around here we call that plain stupid this is a pass all the way now go watch it and then you tell me what you think
<START> this has got to be the best movie i've ever seen br br combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot and you have a masterpiece br br dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes recoiling in horror during others and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending br br the film left a deep impression on me it's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender 'love' scenes the film is undeserving of it's cat iii nudity rating there are no nude scenes whatsoever and the 'love' scenes do not even involve kissing or 'making out' br br the message which this film presented to me all human beings no matter how violent or cruel they may seem have a tender side edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pang br br i rate this film 10 10 it's a must watch
<START> it's remarkable that for 'young mr lincoln's' supporting players ford cast lesser known other than star actors this not only heightens his film's focus on the central character of lincoln but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into lincoln as a man of his place and time a man embroiled as each one of us inexorably is in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them it's not so much through fonda's lincoln's words and actions but in the faces the reactions of the supporting players that ford tells the story of the formation of the young lincoln's worldview sense of place in society and polity and of how the people responded to mr lincoln's words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding br br give this a try instead of focusing on henry fonda next time you view 'young mr lincoln' shift your focus to the supporting characters you will i expect be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both lincoln and ford i like to suspect that ford's storytelling through the supporting characters' reactions to fonda's lincoln may have appealed to david lean when he directed omar sharif in 'doctor zhivago' in which it's the supporting characters' reactions to zhivago that actually tell about zhivago
