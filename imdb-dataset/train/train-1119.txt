<START> awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock stick some b stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didn't have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it' br br horrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak it's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie it's a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future investors it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious time br br don't bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back
<START> this thing is really awfull thereÂ´s no charachter with weight theyÂ´re all floating around in the bgÂ´s the motion capture is a fine toy but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film the machine canÂ´t do anything well by itself if you see it as a bizarre film youÂ´ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity in a 3d movie itÂ´s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics you need animators and 3d animators not data entries whom know 3d programs note the junctions like the elbows how they lost volume and get deformed the person who made the charachter design a very good one sufered for sure when he she watched them move Â´cos you canÂ´t say they come to life
<START> how did this ripoff of being there ever get to be so loved people say it's proof that a decent honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence they're wrong the movie is proof that luck is everything hope your friend invests all your money in apple and not atari hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back hope you don't get aids from your wife this movie is also politically reactionary all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs do drugs beat their girlfriends or die young in addition the product placement in this film nike and dr pepper is shameless an emotionally manipulative film that is very very empty
<START> never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful
<START> i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever i usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i can't even think of one good thing about this movie i like teen witch for heaven's sake but s i c k has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of twin dragons puppet master vs the demonic toys or even a very brady sequel although this is by far worse then any of those i beg you don't even waste your time believe me its 2 hours you'll never get back
<START> i am a big fan of stephen king i loved the running man so obviously i was very excited that someone had made a film of it and when a local network showed the film i was in heaven i was all ready for a night of fun br br the first indicator that something was wrong was when i noticed that someone had cast arnold schwarzenegger i could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part as was described in the book i still was convinced that this would be a good film however who knows maybe arnold had some hidden talents br br well he didn't i soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re written the entire story to make it about fightin' an' shootin' yup it was a standard arnold film hero is done wrong hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl br br i was stunned this is not what the book said at all i know that books can't be put on screen literally but this didn't even have ties to the book stephen king should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title the running man for this shameless waste of film i don't say it often but this film was bad if i weren't at home watching i'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen once again bad br br note that i used 'someone' a lot i did this because i'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and i don't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here
<START> i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either
<START> i thought this had the right blend of character plot futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board it will take a while to get going but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at i like the attitude too certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories
<START> hunky geordie robson green is owen springer a young doctor who moves home to manchester to be near his father along the way he falls for anna a woman 20 years his senior and who happens to be the wife of his new boss richard crane despite warnings from his new colleagues owen proceeds to get anna for himself going as far as to sabotage anna and the cheating richard's marriage this is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit the actors are superb green of the student prince and touching evil smolders on screen as the cunning yet warm hearted owen annis of dune fame is lively and proves a good match to green kitchen from to play the king is the right menace as richard whose comic missteps and snobbery underline his masterful building hatred for owen this is a perfect love triangle and despite the foibles and fallacies of our three characters you come away better for knowing and watching them
<START> this film is horribly acted written directed and produced but it's so campy it's actually semi watchable that's semi watchable br br the storyline what little there is makes virtually no sense whatsoever the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds br br many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of and of course sly stallone's even less talented brother well br br trivia it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont ont about 20 miles n east of toronto i recognized many local landmarks intersections buildings i think the drive in scene was filmed at the now demolished oshawa drive in just before it was torn down
<START> it's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family so imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be that's the premise here br br vince vaughn plays the titular fred an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother santa played by paul giamatti too much praise for simply being the limelight hogging fame hungry slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as then wouldn't you know it fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas and hilarity and life lessons ensue br br well that's what should happen the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of vaughn's patented fast talking a ridiculously out of nowhere music video moment kevin spacey playing an auditor out to close down santa's operation and he's one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit too much of john michael higgins in his elf outfit to be fair he's a highlight though and a movie that's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time br br rachel weisz is along for the ride too as is kathy bates but it's really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here unfortunately there's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker outside of vaughn's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem br br david dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas pudding nope we get a burnt bland lump with too much sugar on top forget this and stick the hilarious elf on again if you want a great modern christmas comedy br br see this if you like the santa clause 2 santa baby the santa clause 3 the escape clause
<START> i saw this movie today at the haifa film festival in israel after hearing rave reviews but i guess the critics were just sucking up to willem defoe and his wife the director who were present at the festival it is definitely the slowest movie i have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing besides defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie defoe's wife giada included was ridiculously awful how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me this movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall the only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money i appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time
<START> running out of films to rent i picked up freebird i struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see fortunately it really warmed up and i loved the movie quite a bit the second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time thankfully although there were bits of cgi included they were not overdone or prevalent br br i would have to say though the actors all have heavy european accents so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor br br i really loved this movie and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection
<START> how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too many br br raising victor vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clichÃ© in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent production br br it's supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose br br it's edgy so let's not waste any time lighting the film br br it's hip so let's have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface br br and so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film
<START> my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times i can't imagine how it could be better this isn't the complete history of wwiiÂno library could hold such a historyÂbut it is the best summary of that history lots of detail lots of personal stories and still keeps the overall picture in view br br olivier's narration is excellently written and of course superbly given the interviews are from all sides except the russian because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd we treasure our copy br br the producer's do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles for instance but still the episode on this subject is very well done
<START> i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie but it's already moving out of my short term memory in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity ben affleck once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man judging from this film the transformation doesn't seem to be taking as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like syriana affleck appears in this type of commercial pap at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried br br directed by mike mitchell whose most famous film is 1999's deuce bigelow male gigolo and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old fashioned christmas he never had the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays the real problem however is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill conceived films fortunately he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine o'hara playing the valcos the couple who decide to accept drew's monetary offer to pretend to be his parents br br gandolfini plays tom like a gruff non violent relative of tony soprano but he does what he can in the role from her classic sctv days to christopher guest's mockumentaries o'hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as tom's wife christine whether dryly delivering a one liner or posing in an inch of make up for a dominatrix photo shoot in what is becoming her standard screen role christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia who of course becomes drew's love interest despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drew's sister in front of his girlfriend's family her character seems to change in lightning flash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order it's rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script it shows but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end
<START> how strange the human mind is this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory and how much do we really know of it's inner workings of it's depth or capacity what is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream or can we perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see like looking at a painting by monet in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality it's a concept visited by filmmaker cameron crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness altering film vanilla sky ' starring tom cruise and penelope cruz at the age of thirty three david aames cruise inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father his fifty one percent controlling interest however has made him something of a marked man as there are seven members of his board of directors and each deems himself more worthy than the young mr aames of the lion's share of the company and fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that david lacks the focus the job requires br br admittedly david likes to play still he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit whether the board he refers to them as the seven dwarfs' likes it or not and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly but during a lavish birthday party in his honor one of the corporate lawyers thomas tipp timothy spall warns david that the seven are up to something behind his back at the time however it's the last thing on david's mind he's been having a casual affair with a friend julie gianni cameron diaz but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind her name is sofia penelope cruz and after knowing her for only one night she becomes a pivotal part of his life which is about to be turned upside down as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever and he is about to learn that sometimes there is simply no going back br br director cameron crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one far more than a movie vanilla sky' is a vision realized beginning with the first images that appear on screen he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting it's a mind twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away emotionally it's a rush and it may leave you exhausted because it requires some effort to stay with it but it's worth it think memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush there's darkness and light and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky simply put this one's a real trip it's exciting and it's a mind bender br br as to the performances here those who can't get past the mind set of tom cruise as maverick in top gun ' or his ethan hunt in mission impossible ' or those who perceive him only as a movie star' rather than an actor are going to have to think again in light of his work here because as david aames cruise gives the best performance of his career one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door he's made some interesting career choices the past few years with films like magnolia' and eyes wide shut' merely warm ups for the very real and complex character he creates here and give him credit too for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity this is cruise as you've never seen him before jerry maguire' earned him an oscar nomination and this one should also as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers cruise is not just good in this movie he is remarkable br br penelope cruz turns in an outstanding if not exceptional performance as well as sofia the woman of david's dreams there's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special something extra' to the part but crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors and he certainly did with cruz br br he also knew what he was doing with cameron diaz who is absolutely vibrant in the role of julie she's never looked better and fairly sizzles on screen but make no mistake this is no window dressing' part and diaz delivers a complete package with this character the quality of her performance can be measured in fact in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time and it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes julie so unforgettable overall a terrific job by diaz br br the supporting cast includes kurt russell dr mccabe jason lee brian johnny galecki peter armand schultz dr pomerantz noah taylor ed mel thompson l e ' man jean carol woman in new york and john fedevich silent ed about half way through this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality but rest assured by the end of vanilla sky' all will be revealed it's a reality bender to be sure and a wild one but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying and unique experience one you have to see to believe it's the essential and absolute magic of the movies 10 10 br br
<START> the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo br br the commercial killers however weren't the only ones shooting bison train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches there were even buffalo killing contests buffalo bill cody killed thousands of buffalo some u s government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once great bison herds br br the last hunt holds one of robert taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guy br br his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter who kills only for pleasure had its potential the will to do harm to another br br when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker stewart granger it is evident that these two contrasted characters with opposite ideas will clash violently very soon br br taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw debra paget who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort br br among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner russ tamblyn as a half breed and constance ford as the dance hall girl but taylor steals the show richard brooks captures in cinemascope and technicolor distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals br br the film is a terse brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero
<START> nb spoiler warning such as it is br br first off this is a teen slasher flick the spam in a cabin genre as joe bob briggs piquantly put it if you're looking for roshambo this isn't it and wasn't going to be it i'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performances br br secondly this wasn't zuniga's first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn br br thirdly you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof and the harvest time is now br br except this one gives the chop to the sweet virginal protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the lass too much credit br br then again this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one movie actors in history of the nineteen credited actors a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film three appeared in one other movie by the same producers only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits what was this the has been and never were mutual aid society br br granted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne br br 2 10
<START> oh dear as an englishman and a small part welsh a fan of anthony hopkins' work in the industry to date i am truly disappointed br br you see i am a nobody who hoped for better so my comments are as 'straw in the wind' but that's the point isn't it i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work i a full member of the great unwashed go to see a movie to be transported to another place to yes suspend belief for a brief period but not to enter a state of total disbelief br br had this been by an unknown author and director i would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion unfortunately its not and i was left wide eyed and confused having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am faintly worried br br perhaps its that i try without prejudice to view each movie on its own merits regardless of author director studio or even the notoriety of the content br br my advice as many before me don't write and direct the same production it is fraught with danger movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility br br as they say in school reports could and can do better
