<START> this movie was boring br br yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that br br the characters are too stereotyped there is no real story but short episodes with freaky side characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine br br shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary a mystery why they took the roles br br this is not a new hope for the hungarian film it was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique they could have tried much more harder than this 2 out of 10
<START> i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he's too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 9 10
<START> two sisters their perverted brother and their cousin have car trouble they then happen about the home of dr hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life he tells them that he'll help them get home in the morning so they spend the night then the good doctor gets down to work in this low budget horror comedy br br i found this to be mildly amusing nothing at all to actually go out of your way for i stumbled across it on netflix instant view streamed it to the xbox 360 but better then i expected it to be for a troma acquired film most of the humor doesn't work but their are still some parts that caused me to smile plus the late great anne ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch br br eye candy bambi darro sylvia lee baker got topless br br my grade d
<START> i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs br br its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and try to get the respect they deserve br br the acting is really good dabney coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy not really evil just unlikeable dolly partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here jane fonda is so so and does little for me lily tomlin is the best thing about this movie she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times gotta love her br br i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' i just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true br br 4 out of 10 stars but give it a try if you haven't seen it i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable
<START> this movie is a muddled mish mash of clichÃ©s from recent cinema there are some promising ideas in there but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film what he ended up with was a confusing mess lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with furthermore the movie is largely devoid of scares although in fairness there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery br br mild spoilers br br we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin diabolical librarians ghostly love interests identity confusion death by savage monkeys oedipal conflict abusive stepfathers sublimated homosexuality and crime gang connections the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent br br perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover the act itself is never directly portrayed instead director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys not very scary br br end spoilers br br avoid this one for an excellent psychological ambiguous horror tale check out the korean film a tale of two sisters 2003
<START> this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment
<START> hollywood's attempt to turn jack london's life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael o'shea as london has some londonesque speeches and it's nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between london's life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br jack london 11 24 43 alfred santell michael o'shea susan hayward virginia mayo
<START> i didn't know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn't i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film
<START> this is easily the worst ridley scott film ridley scott is a wonderful director but this film is a black mark on his career demi moore and viggo mortensen both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army very stupid and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way it is really not difficult to make a film such as this everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody the writers didn't have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess
<START> do not see this movie if you value your mind at the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5 of our brains during its course the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer br br most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me i hate this movie so very very much br br some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didn't take itself seriously but it does the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful whoopee goldberg isn't even trying but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree aka shaft as the blustering commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment br br i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall
<START> this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film at first the action seems rather off the wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves even if grudgingly through each other rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt
<START> this adaptation like 1949's the heiress is based on the henry james novel the heiress starring olivia de havilland remains as a well respected piece of work though less true to james' original story than this new remake which retains james' original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress Â most either love her or hate her Â and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like she's acting through gritted teeth she's not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly Â it's just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy she's not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie
<START> i'm a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie br br recommended
<START> if unlike some of the commenters here you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful extroverted bohemian gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making i'd defend this the film isn't any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate hardie think that's her name as the sarcastic drunk is spot on the one exception being david baddiel who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff it's light and we don't go for this kind of anatomising of relationship crap in this country but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this
<START> the confidential part was meant to piggy back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day however despite the a grade b movie cast and some good script ideas the movie plods along for some 73 minutes it's a cheap jack production all the way what's needed to off set the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director sidney salkow a few daylight location shots for example would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick ear material but salkow treats it as just another pay day exercise too bad that brian keith's typical low key style doesn't work here coming across as merely wooden and lethargic at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr goes over the top as a wild eyed drunk clearly salkow is no actor's director but you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication too bad she wasn't in charge my advice skip it unless you're into ridiculous bar girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait jacketed 50's fashion
<START> sadly 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in 2003 he was one of my all time favourite actors he had it all comedy who can forget him in three's company but he was also an excellent dramatic actor unforgivable Â worth watching tv movie as much i loved all the other cast members of the show katey amy kaley and martin john was the star he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time br br i loved how the show wasn't all sugary sweet as much as i loved the cosby show come on they were too nice to each other lol they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents but they still kept it funny a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not and this show didn't do that yes there were some like tackling important issues such as drugs and bullying but they didn't try and be anything other than a fun family comedy br br the way they wrote john's death in to the show was brilliantly done i still sob like a baby each time i see it you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes br br i'm sad the show was cancelled i still enjoy watching the reruns and i never get tired of it br br john ritter you'll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy you rock ritter
<START> the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves it br br this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a must see anyway br br i can't compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration br br the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x
<START> it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air there's been one couple that has stayed together married and has children but everyone else has broken up what's the point of continuing this the show can be entertaining at the beginning you see all the girls swooning over one man that almost all of them like instantly it's just like in real life the girls start to take sides bitch one another out and show their true selves or so we think but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after br br what is true love exactly how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them this show is unbelievable you thought dating online was bad but people have to go on tv to find love it's not realistic how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others making out with them none of these questions are answered and finally when the show ends you know there won't be a happy ending in the future for all we know everything is scripted
<START> just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity awful acting plus the lovemaking scenes are the most un sexy i've ever seen and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love since i'm gay br br again as in mil nubes de paz julian hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it and this time there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican gay community to talk about god gracious have mercy on us
<START> just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay movie the cat's meow by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit the key moments of the story seem implausible for example when hurst accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be chaplin basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived the story attempts to be a dark comedy but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation comedy there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters it hardly matters who is shot who is killed who is guilty and who is innocent there is not a strong character to cheer for as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental
