<START> i have watched this film twice now and think its quite good for the limited equipment used to create this film filmed in 1947 dr heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of south american pre colubian indians to the polynesia's islands by way raft fell of large balsa trees this documentary follows dr heyerdahl and crew as they select balsa trees in equidor and float with them down river to the pacific for assembly in peru they launch off on a 101 day sea adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft surviving only by means available to natives of that era see for yourself a real adventure
<START> finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a non documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass it's all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader it's near perfect where where can i get hold of it
<START> i saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release and man did it look scary especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon i was incredibly interested and thought that this could finally be a decent horror thriller film after years if crap well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements the advertisements for the movie did both which lead to my ultimate disappointment br br by no means is this the most disturbing movie in years hell i doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week's release this movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far br br this movie wasn't complete crap i must admit it held my interest and micheal keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means other than that though this film is one big clichÃ© after john's wife dies he learns about evp which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances he all of the sudden receives messages from his wife my god it's not just his wife reaching him it's other dead people gee imagine that a movie about helping dead people come on give me a break the clichÃ©s don't stop there there's also the obligatory clock stopping at the same exact time every night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero not only was the movie clichÃ© it wasn't scary the film literally had two jump scenes and those two scenes are almost identical the ending is horrible as it leaves the door wide open for a sequel there's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of x voices heard through evp are threatening with a nice happy tune playing way to break the mood you guys jeez in the end if you want another forgettable horror film see white noise the only reasons i could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a keaton fan or that they are interested in evp sure the evp aspects may be slightly interesting but i don't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face this film tries to be scary original and disturbing but it's just the opposite you know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film i will see this film no more
<START> stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head imagine the auditions for this can you no that's not quite it thank you next anyway he's bitten by a bat and then he's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or he's not for no one else sees his strange transformations but he himself seems to think that he's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws etc to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually transforming into something until almost the very end this has some good locations sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting kind of fun in a so bad it's good way but leans more towards just plain bad 4 out of 10
<START> a brutally depressing script and some fine low key performances by peter strauss and pamela reed and some good location shooting in ohio power this fine tv movie about hard times in the rustbelt as the mills close and the union jobs disappear the blue collar workers are threatened by everyone management owners their wives and children strauss is completely believable in his role and pamela reed is as always wonderful see if you can recognize john goodman before he put on weight br br the heavy metal score was someone making a pun is at times obtrusively annoying but the cinematography by frank stanley is knockout particularly the mill scenes
<START> this movie was banned in england why tom savini george romero dario argento lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since br br this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film good looking girls who can't act to save their lives by the way a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour a scythe a crazy brother wandering around the family estate and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end but banned seriously when the english parliament banned this movie the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were br br there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly underdone there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made obviously but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned br br i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with as it stands the film is entertaining but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result br br banned what a joke
<START> well if you are open minded enough to have liked barber shop then you will like this canadian film br br if your mind is as closed minded as fort knox then you will give it the current score that it has 2 5 br br this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds it is engaging it is true to life on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes but many times especially towards the end you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like br br i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film
<START> i rented this film just to see amber benson though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good story however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense the second problem was there was no set up for these characters yes i got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each other so why did they keep getting together flaw number 3 the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in he was sadly mistaken it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time trying to bring this back to life my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film
<START> there are two groups of people those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films i can also honestly say that i can't stand some of them my opinion by the way is not just some knee jerk reaction i have seen most of fellini's films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors with this in mind i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the intelligensia while the average person would never sit through some of their films heck even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films so since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses it's not surprising that their films are so often praised it's like a cult if you don't believe me think about many of godard's films such as first name carmen or alphaville or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits these films abound with boredom weirdness and incomprehensibility now i am not saying a film can't be weird after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer but it must be watchable br br now on to this movie somehow fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy this is no small task it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable instead of cheap sexual thrills the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul i know some of this must have been fellini's intention but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance especially since sutherland's lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself unfortunately when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades there really isn't anything else to watch br br an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini's wife giulietta masina considering that in addition to this that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i've ever seen followed by peter pan 2 and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the hunchback of notre dame 2 all these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes i'm not saying the jokes are bad but they make up most of the movie the first time i saw the movie i would have given it a 1 10 but now i think about it most kids don't care how good the original movie was they just care that the movie is entertaining i still think the movie was a bad sequel but that doesn't mean it's horrible now i think it deserves a 3 10
<START> indian summer is a warm multi character film that would make a fine afternoon film with a bit of editing br br the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp uncle lou the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay br br the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well it never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself br br for a warm nostalgic character movie i sincerely recommend
<START> i must admit there are few books with corresponding movies that i have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation nineteen eighty four happens to be one of those rare cases the book was great it was immersive and interestingly prophetic but the movie just plain sucked it is easily the worst film i have ever seen the only reason i didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two part assignment for a class it was dark and grotesque but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere the acting was nothing above average and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out this was severely disappointing the book for example didn't give me the impression that winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time boring disturbing and visually unappealing the movie totally cannibalized the book wait a second isn't it british
<START> house of games is spell binding it's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens there are few movies i've seen that can grip you so quickly from the opening scene this movie just gets you br br i'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don't read anymore if you don't want to know br br i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen bar none from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed br br lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately joe mantegna was also wonderful the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices i also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was br br there were a few movies i've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really house of games is completely different in it's way margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying you know something's going to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think you've guessed what the something is you realize you haven't even scratched the surface br br house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion br br in closing i'd rank this 10 of 10 call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists i've ever seen as well although i love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesn't get much better then this see this movie
<START> the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims on the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a not so positive message about rape aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying br br the director satish kaushik went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way the director is famous for being chauvinistic his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong br br the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya 'cleans' herself after just being raped she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confusing message about rape br br the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout the music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully picturised the only bright point of this film sonali bendre's role is disappointing and pointless overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion
<START> in the first 20 minutes every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director there was the ntsb primary investigator with the tortured family life the politically tortured ntsb board member played by i can kill any tv ted mcginley the tortured father of a crash victim and the torturing sleazy ambulance chasing lawyer br br hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft the crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap the first third of the fuselage was intact the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in iowa after it lost its hydraulics most of this tv plane wasn't even burned br br it reminded me of the scene in air force one where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch thick steel br br the show was so bad it was impossible to watch even my wife who is more accepting than i was commenting on technical flaws what had me stunned was how this pos could ever get made are the producers of these things so used to clichÃ©s that they can't even recognize them somebody read this script and said yes i want to spend a million bucks making this real i wish i was the guy's next appointment i have title to a wonderful bridge in new york that i'd sell cheap
<START> remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90's the one that people praised the one that people of all ages could all appreciate the one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit the one that had villains you could relate to the one that had villains with real motives br br well clearly warner bros doesn't hence this dreck br br honestly do these people know anything about batman have they even looked at a batman comic before do they know batman's meant to be a 'detective' putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective that makes you a slightly intelligent monkey br br this is the basic layout for an episode br br penguin steals something 'opening credits' batman finds dead giveaway of where he is batman goes there and get's into trouble commercial batman finds obvious stupid way out of it penguin escapes penguin does something obvious again batman follows they do kung fu by the way everyone and i mean everyone know's kung fu for some reason batman punch's penguin he get's knocked out goes to arkham note it's usually a different villain every episode br br well as you may have noticed from that batman's not a great detective joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground maybe he's at the old amusement park yeah maybe he was there the last 6 times br br and i've already mentioned this but everyone knows kung fu even penguin what where they thinking probably because it's from the people who made that jackie chan animated series br br what's really upsetting is that the show is just action no smarts none if batman needs think he'll use technology then do some kung fu br br but hey let's not forget the villains afterall what would batman be without his rogues gallery br br well first off i gotta say kudos for originality i don't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread locked monkey man riddler like an emo and poison ivy as a minor which is kind of confusing when you think about isn't her sexuality meant to be her main strength br br what's even more crap however is that every character is now a 2 dimensional stereotypical crook br br e g br br killer croc wants to flood gotham for no reason br br man bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason br br penguin just wants to steal everything for no reason br br noticing a pattern here br br but the most insulting has got to be mr freeze br br do you remember the emmy award winning 'heart of ice' episode from batman the animated series the one that gave mr freeze motives for his crimes the episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story mad scientist the one that made him a victim with a goal hell even batman robin acknowledged that using that as mr freezes origin in that p o s movie br br well this series says f ck that and makes mr freeze a jewelry robber before his accident with only wealth in his mind then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold he then continues to steal jewels for no reason while saying sh t lines like have an ice day br br maybe they did watch batman robin after all br br but hey look on the bright side this series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you're a good person good for you
<START> a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
<START> my 3rd year french classes always enjoyed this film very much in a multi cultural inner city high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in french in class but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class the most obvious is the relationship between protÃ©e and aimÃ©e compared to the one between protÃ©e and france br br i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes i had ever seen in a movie one year a 17 year old african american shouted yes when he figured out the scene the one where protÃ©e is helping aimÃ©e lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexy br br most students had trouble understanding the end of the film one suggested that one theme of the movie was africanism and that no matter how much one loved africa or africans one cannot become african like the driver tried to do one must be african
<START> the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah's own stand up it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart the fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it it's a very polarizing and one dimensional show so if you don't like it after 10 minutes you may as well give up there if you do like it after 10 minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the last br br like all shows though it is not perfect personally i love the program but there are some huge faults with it racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize a problem that i had with jesus is magic as well it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isn't br br another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python upright citizens brigade etc it is nothing like those shows i can watch monty python all day but as much as i like this show i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time it gets flat very fast the repeat value for this show is low too the second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion it's boring br br still that first time around is very very funny give it a shot
<START> make the world go away get it off my shoulder say the things you used to say and make the world go away br br well dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller were in a pickle one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down they ended up in well nothing the whole world except for their house went away br br it is kind of weird but funny too just what would you do if you were all alone in the world the two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want but that gets old fast it seems br br then they start to improve their live by hating away memories the sound effects during this were great br br things really got weird at the end this film was the product of a great imagination and written and directed by vincenzo natali with help from the two stars it just has to be seen
