<START> this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer br br by the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about
<START> a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine and here susan lucci performs as a siren although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one isabelle lucci inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins john o'hurley begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart in the wake of the hit man's assault upon collins a pair of police detectives performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott become increasingly curious concerning isabelle's possible involvement in the crime while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements released upon a fremantle dvd this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top flight visual and sound quality and although no extra features are provided the above average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards
<START> gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story it's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan the movie's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't work and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided the movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1 please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
<START> this was a new alltime low among westerns the writing is excruciatingly bad characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism 'ride with the devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect
<START> lets enter the world of this movie for a second so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here br br edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50 000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars shouting at them and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief instead of just walking up and pop what do you do the bad guy he talks to him he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun they have nothing to talk about shoot him shoot him now but he talks to him anyway oh another thing at the end a newspaper says pulitzer prize winner story right here or something right above on a front page of a paper when its like the first time the story is printed so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast yea you know those types of stupid movies yea well that's edison in a nutshell br br you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places and who's last line duck was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks little cocky bastard the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best denzel from training day impression which was pretty entertaining br br oh yea so whats the movie about eh something about scandals involving the city edison's fictional special unit police force called f r a t i swear i'm not making this stuff up which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s w a t anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from frat and he goes scurrying off looking for a story gaining his boss' freeman trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought blah blah blah its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day the pacing was slow and off the script was horrible and the acting was extremely uninspired it jumped everywhere without going anywhere people get put in comas and you forget about them everyone in this movie just didn't think damn what a stupid movie its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended no lie basically do not waste your time
<START> it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to albuquerque gabby hayes juke sounds like duke is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general with his girlfriend pearl being an exception he then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of pearl who is the town barber no less and who claims if everyone followed his example she would be out of business this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers but is a definite plus to this one it's too bad he wasn't in more of the better randoph scott westerns to help lighten up randy's usual iron jawed demeanor also on this stage are randy cole armin his future wife cathrine craig as celia wallace whom he is getting acquainted with and a little girl myrtle to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of randy's wheelchair bound uncle john armin george cleveland who essentially runs the town br br randy soon learns that his uncle and by extension himself is not exactly popular among the town folk he does however quickly form a useful friendship with gabby after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor celia wallace and the associated murder he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for celia and her brother ted russell hayden instead of for uncle john br br as his rival's prospects rise uncle john decides to plant an informant barbara britton as letty tyler in the wallace office to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run when this doesn't work he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office for which randy is blamed unfortunately when the fire was discovered randy was in letty's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle john myrtle and letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered this puts him and letty in the dog house with celia his apparent beau and ted who hopes to woo letty this news also ends uncle john's trust in letty as an informant and he suggests she leave town instead she switches sides and tells the wallaces why randy was in her apartment uncle john tries once again to sabotage their ore run and when that fails there is a general shootout in town you can guess the results br br the plot is well constructed and executed with complicated relationships between the principles and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome with the sometimes aid of his associates at least randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination but arrogantly trusted that a woman wouldn't have the guts to carry out her threat the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women as well as little myrtle much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival as uncle john put it br br it seems odd that barbara britton the bad girl gets top female billing over catherine craig randy's love interest barbara's on camera time was much more limited br br those who grew up on the lassie tv series featuring george cleveland as gramps will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain we may wonder if his wheelchair bound status has a bearing on this persona this leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild west without apparent family to help support him except randy he can't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town on the other hand from his conversations he probably achieved his status as the town boss before becoming wheelchair bound
<START> i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself the devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy maidens are chained up the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner peter weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her
<START> i don't know what it is with this movies but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy of course it's not 100 accurate it's difficult to make 100 accurate films nowadays when even the experts disagree with each other therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies br br so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast the series should have been a three part story his childhood being the first part but if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that br br there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane more scenes where he doubts himself etc noah taylor did that more in the movie 'max' which seem to work better i think nevertheless i'm glad this was made and own it on dvd just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best 7 5 10
<START> if they could get ed asner why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers and why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger it forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability i guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work if the d bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better he has good reason to be jealous good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective controlling manipulative father all the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the 'bad' boyfriend how did they meet anyway a wine broker and a saw mill worker
<START> br br worst movie ever br br what was the purpose of filming this remake aside from turning it into a 90 minute informercial for the movie's soundtrack zombies that run i guess the director never watched the original dead films which show stiff limbed from rigor mortis creatures shuffling shambling toward their living prey br br and how exactly did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve br br 1 10
<START> there is one good thing in this movie lola glaudini's ass sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth too bad she didn't do a nude it would at least have made this mess tolerable we see another chick's boobs but she's nowhere near lola and man is armand assante old or what the man looks like crap consequence is the usual b movie you would expect the story had potential it's like they had good ideas but didn't know how to execute them the cinematography is just plain awful ugly the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap slutty way but not even she saves consequence from being trash and not funny trash just plain old stinking trash
<START> i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie
<START> up until the last few minutes of the movie i would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars however the ending is so terrible and hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80 of the movie br br the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles the captain gene hackman is all for launching while his first officer denzel washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first the problem is to launch both the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched cool however here comes the part that just doesn't ring true after they are back on land and go before a review board washington and hackman who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other shake hands and are all buddy buddy huh too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me
<START> at the time my left foot was the little movie that could it was hugely popular and everyone applauded the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the oscars br br since then movies like my left foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about it's certainly a well made and competent film but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day lewis who immerses himself in the role of cristy brown a man living with cerebral palsy day lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in rain man and the academy followed suit by giving day lewis the same honor br br the only thing really separating this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that its budget in every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product that's not to say it isn't a good movie but it's not a masterpiece br br grade a
<START> but i regret having seen it since the ratings on imdb are relatively high and they must also have been relatively high on netflix i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk a category that has produced many films i liked immensely saving grace on the other hand falls into the category of laugh less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless brenda blethyn is a capable actress and i have liked her in other movies the concept a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband's death does not offend me notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor the film falls flat on its face falling flat on its arse might have been funnier as far as i and my wife were concerned be forewarned oh gentle reader not all offbeat british comedies succeed this one is a dud
<START> this is above all else the typical crown international pictures drive in read passion pit programmer the 1975 sammy johns hit record chevy van is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack this movie has even been reissued with the title chevy van despite the film's title vehicle being a dodge danny devito makes only six minutes of on screen appearance but countless vhs reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick the movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale will bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one night stand his customised van facilitates or must he wait until tina the girl of his dreams gives him the time of day still it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male american high schoolers of the time and on that basis alone the van has almost in spite of itself become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the period's popular american cinema
<START> in 2006 the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman br br walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now they've taken their stabs at live action film making and it's been hit and miss all across the board disney then created a sub division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i've seen in quite sometime br br narrated by the great james earl jones earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter br br it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven't experienced before it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails it's one thing to watch mufasa fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods it's all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film this shows penguins polar bears elephants all types of families from all walks of life living and dying in their natural habitats these real things make a real movie experience br br though a bit heavy weight on the graphic nature of the film which many people will disagree earth is a touching experience there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own at the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we'll witness in the film we live here yet it's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another earth is beautiful br br
<START> wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe that i started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce i started watching i couldn't stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even eartha kitt and ruby dee forrest whittaker and james earl jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people don't know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about i've never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses only looks down on because they were privleged and mixed race i highly recommend this movie
<START> an unassuming subtle and lean film the man in the white suit is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course br br the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired kind hearts and coronets from 1949 this time he merely plays one character rather than eight but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton he always finds the correct tone and expression along with guinness' subtle expressive performance the rest of the cast are effective of the main players cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father father that is of joan greenwood the deftly delectable comic actress who is at her insurmountable peak in this film resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction she is quite sublime in this film a fine contrast with the similarly unusual but more maladroit guinness the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing br br the themes are handled very effectively with no easy morals drawn the complexities of the relationships between science business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick this film is technically adept in all areas evocative photography fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script all quietly impress a thoroughly satisfying film with guinness and greenwood magnificent br br rating 1 2
<START> this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas honky tonk in the early 1980's john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull if you love a good romance film then you will love this movie
