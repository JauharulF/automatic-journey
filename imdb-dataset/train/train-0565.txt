<START> i remember watching lost missile actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me i was from time to time the eric cartman of the 1960s sorry guys and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million degree heat emerged as a plot device even as a second grader i knew that a mere missile just couldn't carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation br br my inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self punishing crime br br the film's production values were very good the acting isn't bad apart from the shatnerism of the actor who played governor's aide that someone else here mentioned br br but the idea of a missile easy baking the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its exhaust no br br how'd the people at mystery science theater 3000 miss the lost missile anyway br br it's a great classic of unintentional comedy watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend
<START> in reviewing this film i can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in july august and september of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth fort polk louisiana take the high ground was not anything like i remember basic training br br but one has to remember at the time this was post korea which ended in a stalemate but it was a conventional war as we knew them it was not vietnam a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit the draft at that time was an unwelcome but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense br br richard widmark is a veteran of korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas the film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train they're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade br br one thing i will praise take the high ground for is the fact that mgm recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of william hazard as a black recruit in the platoon it was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing br br but i will say that a recruit like russ tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one richard widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give jerome courtland confidence with a weapon and no way would have he worried so much about robert arthur deserting he's have just let the mps deal with him br br of course being shot in and around fort bliss and el paso texas did give take the high ground good authenticity but view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day br br i do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you weren't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95 of the time but there ain't no way that karl malden would have slugged widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits both would have realized that would have undermined authority something the military just doesn't let happen br br i wish i could have said something better about take the high ground because i certainly like its talented cast it's talented director richard brooks even the silly theme by dimitri tiomkin and ned washington fresh from their oscar a year before for high noon the film actually got an oscar nomination for best screenplay and story by millard kaufman it must have been for kaufman's vivid imagination
<START> this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers br br a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it's good br br it's just bad
<START> this is an absolutely incredible film it shows south african racism from the perspective of the victims and provokes a feeling of anti racism in everyone who sees it it is the best historic film i have ever seen
<START> i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season 9 should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool
<START> i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didn't feel like a film it felt more like a documentary the part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year old girls i know br br all in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films
<START> i dunno sometimes you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved bat people which i saw under the title it lives by night is just such a movie you can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on night gallery and not one of the better ones either br br the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were bat who drinks human blood actually you'd think if he was turning into a real bat he'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket but because this is a cheap lurid horror movie blood's the word in spite of the fact that he has grand mal seizures at the drop of a hat and black out episodes almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr mustache aspen extreme insists that he's just having an 'allergic reaction' to the rabies shots meanwhile the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls and one wino also meanwhile the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction br br it's not so much that the acting is bad you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff okay it is pretty bad but it's bad in a clichÃ©d wooden professional way it's just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involved br br i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite but br br 1 the director needed to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until pataki agreed to act and not just channel dennis weaver br br 2 he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bites human who then turns into a bat scenario br br 3 he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes' instead of resorting to man has a seizure page from the little golden book of clichÃ©d acting mannerisms br br 4 he needed to rework the whole 'wife' character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant br br i would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bots it's bad but it isn't bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still better than battlefield earth or waterworld though
<START> most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia cut off from the communities in which they study and live their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty steven greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members br br the documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population as is usual the people who scream the most get the most media attention other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set the documentary was well made my only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them br br naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals
<START> this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children's comic i gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good br br this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened
<START> at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie i referred to it as the most important movie i'd seen in ten years and found myself bumping into people who said similar things br br bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had into a corrosive adult world view the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers hi skip i wish you weren't my brother so i could you br br bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york results in the immersive trying on of various personas all of which fit poorly for our amusement but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black imperative values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her it's been a while nina simone comes to mind and she has an impressive solidly built black lover in the movie a pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to be authorizing sandra's faux blackness but ultimately rejects her br br just as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection it's the only value system implicated in the films world outside of bernhards arty confusion br br for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money it's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way
<START> with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy sub story line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did
<START> it's not like that big mechanical toy says a character early on commenting on jaws well blood surf would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the jaws series in other words the digital special effects of this movie are terrible acting and directing are not much better either they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble gum commercial than to a horror movie the attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but for the audience too saying you liked this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap further destroying the poor horror genre 1 2
<START> for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and film making as a reminder to those that live here locales include boulder creek bonny doon davenport big basin etc the bank was the bc firehouse chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236 empire grade rd and hwy 1 br br production jeffrey jones was the most approachable matt broderick was above us all even back then as far as the film goes a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot but who cares at this level a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery br br additional notes joe's bar jed's tavern in the film original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw the old erba's parking lot was the town square the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days
<START> why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing bye bye birdie at the opening she reprises it again at the ending too in a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if that's all of it that you watch you'll agree i'm sure br br everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as tyne and chynna in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their 'all ' but it's like trying to improve on casablanca it just can't be done it's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors
<START> sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one you can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension why he lent his name to this vermin
<START> a typical romp through cheech and chong's reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs pee wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and space coke it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as nice dreams there are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work also funny is cheech's song mexican americans and chong's follow up song another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones human noise machine from the police academy series and the old laughing man all in all this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not br br celluloid rehab
<START> in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights this must have been very hep for 1936 but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see however bette davis daisey appleby the whales of august '87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brent johnny jones the spiral staircase '46 daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye davis and brent made a great couple one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter off stage davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film if you liked bette davis and george brent this is the film for you
<START> did you ever wonder how far one movie could go br br schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo br br harry is an aggravated writer killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck harry begins his killing spree br br from director ron atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmed br br the only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled schizophreniac necromaniac br br this is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone but if you are looking for something disturbing different and horrific then this would make a fine choice br br do not expect anything like modern day horror such as scream br br viewer discretion is advised
<START> this film is so unbelievable the whole premise is bunkum the fact that a serial killer vampire or otherwise could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable the vampire himself would not look out of place in a bela lugosi film most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot i await the day when someone makes a decent film from a steven king novel with the exception possibly of stand by me this film suffers from what most stephen king films do lack of money used for the special effects poor actors appalling characterisation and dialogue this film is cheap tacky and fails in everything it tries to do
<START> sakura killers 1 outta 5 stars maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool if you had never ever seen a good ninja movie cheesy '80s music cheesy dialogue cheesy acting and way beyond cheesy martial arts sequences the coolest scene is at the beginning with an aged chuck connors playing golf on a beach several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and naw i won't spoil it for you if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me the story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something a bunch of dim bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something like that strange these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before oh well the movie does move along pretty briskly the fight scenes may not be great but they are plentiful and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles
