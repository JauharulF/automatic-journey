<START> i read tom robbins' even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager i loved every word it was sexy funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing but when i saw the movie i could not believe what a dull sour joyless piece of junk it was how did this happen i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under gay pride women lesbians that's the library of congress subject heading now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians any more than star wars is about real space travel the book was obviously and i do mean obviously written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians in the nude all the time but has never really met one br br still someone in hollywood said uh oh better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble so they handed it to gus van sant nothing against the man but however gay he may really be he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film gus van sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt free girl girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull literal minded lesbian power recruiting poster it's like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy not pretty br br the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting his clout allowed him to hire the very best his ignorance of the novel's real subtext a straight man's fantasy not a gay pride recruiting poster caused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre br br let's meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues br br pat morita as the chink okay there are few name recognition asian actors and pat morita in happy days was fairly funny but casting him as the chink was wrong wrong wrong pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man gus didn't tell him pat also doesn't seem to know that the chink is well sexy in the book he's not wise old mr miyagi he's more like hugh hefner he's a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean you see in the book they aren't really lesbians do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet br br john hurt as the countess okay he's a gay friendly man but he is a serious shakespearean actor you need someone who is fun and camp for this role for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more and sadly shake his head now richard you know you've lost your soul entirely for shame my former student and yes john hurt was funny and pretty gay as caligula but that was black humor not playful and breezy humor like the book br br rain phoenix as bonanza jellybean no talent no training no problem except that in the book bonanza is funny playful cheerful mostly heterosexual and loving in the movie she's sullen passive expressionless and dull as for her taste for women robbins in the book puts it like this god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits uh gus did you read this book br br uma thurman as sissy hankshaw this is a tough role in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine still a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye or a sway in her walk to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures uma doesn't pull it off probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs uma plays it more like she's in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia br br this movie is sour and dull and i accuse you gus van sant
<START> the minute the forward started i knew we were in for trouble the premise is laughable at best the story line was even worse if that is possible br br the acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience you expect more from the likes of slater reid and dorff lines were delivered as if from a robot and i'm sorry i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an archaeologist slater and dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks br br the continuity was off through out the entire film the creatures weren't bad but they really weren't good either br br bottom line i want that ninety minutes of my life back they can keep the money but give me the time what a waste
<START> douglas sirk directs this over acted drama about the unhappy affluent kyle hadley robert stack and mitch wayne rock hudson are boyhood friends with different looks on life kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon mitch works for the hadley oil company both fall in love with the same woman lucy moore but it is kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her sister marylee dorothy malone seems to be the town's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch for mitch who always seems to be the one to clean up the hadley's messes ambitious with pretension a little over the top but the stars make it a movie to see i was most impressed with malone rounding out the cast robert keith edward platt john lurch and robert j wilke
<START> resnais wow the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old embellished inter titles was a nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party this is all in the first 60 seconds br br then the music starts a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i can't blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film br br i'm not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out i endured br br it didn't get much better i'll tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we don't even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around a lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it's as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie with bad songs br br the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did 1 hour was that i was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all i admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours not me maybe tomorrow i'll try watching the end aw who am i kidding i have more important things to do i'm sure you do too skip this
<START> i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read it does not do justice to this incredible movie for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child my sister and i couldn't wait until every april when we could see it on t v it is one of the best horse movies of it's time it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch the romance is clean and endearing the story line is interesting and the songs are great they don't make movies like this anymore good acting and not over the top pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
<START> perhaps i couldn't find the dvd menu selection for plot on off clearly the default is off when the end credits began to roll i couldn't believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty cheap br br the characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writer's disdain for wealthy thatcherites was all to apparent i consider myself a roosevelt democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtlety br br of course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i br br the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was the nice scenery human and plant
<START> this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver's license it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars br br such things as dune buggies drag racing custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times none of the people in the film are actually heard instead everything is done in narration and voiceovers sorry but i can't stand that br br there is nothing educational or interesting about dad can i borrow the car it's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their wonderful world of disney tv show 1 10
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed bilal's graphic novel when it came out and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself the film however was a major letdown the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks and the story is poorly told bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel and he doesn't do a very good job at it either br br the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship hate relationship between nikopol and horus they were both out of their right time and place forced together by circumstance most of all they were funny and likable not so here nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid even though the film is french horus doesn't have to be br br we have all seen films we enjoyed but wouldn't recommend to everyone for some reason or other i wouldn't recommend immortel to anyone except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources bilal's a master storyteller but obviously not a master of every visual medium
<START> some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one br br the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences tomas beccket who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was cold hearted however after beccket showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his softness inside it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold hearted br br millar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through one's heart as what beccket said what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award br br these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other br br sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one
<START> wwe was in need of a saviour as wrestlemania 14 rolled around the departure of bret hart and subsequent evaporation of the hart foundation had left the vile d generation x stable unchallenged in the wwe their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the interference of vince mcmahon and with help from his cohorts triple h and chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy but at the royal rumble a new contender had emerged stone cold steve austin hated by mcmahonagement austin had dx worried so worried in fact that they'd enlisted the help of the baddest man on the planet mike tyson as a special enforcer austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaels br br but first there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no 1 contenders for the tag titles i'd actually forgotten this match existed until i rewatched the ppv no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time br br next match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila the wwe had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in wcw it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at wrestlemania short match going about five minutes and in fact too short for much to be achieved what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw taka retaining his title br br ok our next match saw dx member triple h defending the wwe european title which he'd won in farcical fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and hadn't defended on ppv against owen hart the sole survivor triple h got a big entrance with the dx band there to perform his theme song chyna accompanied triple h to ringside but was then handcuffed to wwe commissioner sgt slaughter triple h and owen have a nice little match before chyna interfered causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h retaining the title good match could have been great had it gone slightly longer br br but of course we wouldn't want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc mero and sable defeat goldust and luna vachon in the first mixed tag match at wrestlemania in 8 years and in all honesty it wasn't worth the wait while not terrible the match was in no way memorable either this was the nearing the end of mero's only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with sable br br next up we saw ken shamrock flip out and cost himself the intercontinental championship as he destroyed ic champion the rock but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold resulting in the referee reversing his decision this was a short match but decent for what it was br br next saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team champions the new age outlaws lost their titles to cactus jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun dumpster match the decision was overturned the following night as cactus and chainsaw had thrown the outlaws into a dumpster backstage rather than the one being used in the match but this was still a fun match br br now it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then killed him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before this was a decent match and told a nice story as the underataker absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match br br this left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike tyson as the guest enforcer michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations triple h and chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside the match ended with austin ducking an attempt at sweet chin music and hitting the stone cold stunner with the ref down tyson then came into the ring to count the three celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match it turned out tyson and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along br br that was the final ppv match for shawn michaels for four and a half years it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by tyson's appearance proved a crucial turning point in the wwe's battle with wcw austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history and along with the rock mick foley the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance and it all started here at wrestlemania 14
<START> jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think it's the former and his self centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don't like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my all time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
<START> i couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned jodorowsky br br barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired content wise he can produce eye candy and i like candy but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy br br i am afraid that many people don't distinguish between similar but really only on the surface works of jodorowsky or even more linear film makers like tarkovski or kubrick i love 2001 odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes that kind of art as m barney's makes adds confusion and fends off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema typical empty post modern conceptual art and check his interviews i just don't buy it sorry and so boring br br i was never bored seeing alejandro jodorowsky's movies while drawing restraint 9 was an utter disappointment especially while it offered the possibilities to be something to actually tell something in a non linear unorthodox way like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail out ships meeting on the sea ideas of feces as an object of value if it was feces those pearl divers everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content but it didn't and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony how vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty can it get br br i has some great picturesque scenes but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick br br and it doesn't have good tempo i like slow pace movies but this was just boring in some scenes because it was pretentious and fake so i was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity br br that kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view br br i want more jodorowsky
<START> it was the tag line in the tradition of american pie that fooled me into renting this movie what i got was a piece of junk in the style of jackass with the major difference that compared to this jackass the movie seems like a citizen kane br br this movie made me regret that i rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10 because now i can't go beneath that this one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats br br i actually turned it off after 45 minutes and that's something i very rarely do but it was just too plain boring stupid uninteresting and unnecessary br br can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10 what did your parents do drop you on the head when you were just a child or was it the very first movie you ever saw so you got nothing to compare it to are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off something must be wrong at least br br my advice stay clear of this one even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking choose something else or you'll regret it for sure
<START> marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio high art studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film
<START> this is is a thoroughly unpleasant if slickly made movie i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum two good actors and because the plot line a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution sounded promising the movie is billed as a comedy sorta what we have is an endless series of shots you should pardon the pun of people in dimly lit and elegant if somewhat surreal interiors shooting each other in the head stomach kneecap foot heart no part of the anatomy is avoided it seems while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue some of which is supposed evidently to be humorous in a sort of post modern way goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card and he wears a single facial expression a sardonic grin throughout ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can burt reynolds does a cameo the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop but i somehow missed them good move on their part the whole thing is cold sterile mechanical and unsavory an heir i suspect to the style of 'pulp fiction' 'fargo' and 'natural born killers' if you liked those you'll probably like this
<START> last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito's way carlito's way rise to power 2005 which went straight to dvd no wonder it completely and i mean completely s ks waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it i don't understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh t fest of a movie except for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay hernandez who plays the young brigante reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh ty movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth
<START> there is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that i hit a gem with this one from beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks br br father of two sons hears messages from god to kill people who he is told are 'demons' br br when the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non stop from beginning to end br br and there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub plots and the script is first class br br all the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional br br this film is at least as good as the likes of 'silence of the lambs'
<START> wha bam someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture writer howard cohen expands the sword sorcery concept with a couple of extra s's like sex silliness more sex and sheer stupidity this isn't just a movie this is every juvenile pervert's dreams fantasies come true deathstalker has it all blood violence trolls female mud wrestling attempted rape successful rape life sized pigs awful hairstyles hideously oiled muscular bodies multi sexual orgies gay warriors tournaments to the death delirious witches dismemberment laughable villains and boobs boobs booooooooobies deathstalker literally wipes the floor with its obvious role model conan the barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance the story is evidently of minor importance lone and gay only he doesn't know it yet warrior deathstalker goes on a mission as commanded by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of creationÂ or something like that on his journey he combines forces with a troll turned human a fighter who's even gayer than he is and last but not least a luscious lady who doesn't really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil munkar where they'll participate in a warriors' tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements munkar is bald guy with half a spider's web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous okay granted deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie the fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make up effects are downright pitiable for a moment when beholding the opening sequence i actually feared i was watching troll the prequel the monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but it's undeniable entertainment if you're in an undemanding mood i presume this isn't a favorite amongst feminists as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat ÂumÂdiscriminating most of the gals exclusively serve as eye candy in the harem they're allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths the two leading ladies barbi benton and lana clarkson are ravishing but in all honesty if it wouldn't be for their continuously exposed racks they would hardly be worth mentioning either
<START> in my opinion this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece if you ask me the stepmother voice of lucille la verne was truly diabolical you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why on the other hand despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping cinderella voice of ilene stanley was a very beautiful lady to me the scenery was beautiful the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well now in conclusion i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it you're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> cabin fever is the first feature film directed by eli roth roth and randy pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by roth this a zombie film which owes a lot to george romero and his earlier living dead movies and to the original texas chainsaw massacrenot to mention sam ramie's evil dead there is nothing original here and the story is not compelling the acting is about par with this genre it's just that the story fails we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made having said that after having achieved commercial if not artistic success from this movie roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious mean spirited pointless though much more ambitious crap fest hostel roth should have quit while he was behind cabin fever is not a good film however compared to hostel it is a work of art i hope somebody preferably a psychiatrist convinces this guy that film making is the wrong career choice as for cabin fever a weak 3 10 for not being as abysmal as hostel
