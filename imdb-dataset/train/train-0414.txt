<START> on this 4th of july weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the declaration of independence alive and well in the film war inc just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war profiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government to include privatizing war itself br br the cast in this satire absolutely shines john cusack is wonderful as a droll conflicted corporate assassin and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest my gosh george costanza was right marisa tomei is so attractive but it is john's sister joan cusack who really steals the film her portrayal of a bossy yet simultaneously sycophantic personal assistant is priceless and more than once i just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance she not only possesses fantastic comic timing her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor dan ackroyd too has a short but very effective cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war the tamerlane corporation sitting on a throne with his pants down around his ankles ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power you won't have to think too hard to recognize that person much of this movie was filmed in bulgaria which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war profiteering i especially enjoyed the character of omar sharif as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install and uninstall in power br br naturally this film won't appeal to everyone if you believe that the on going privatization of our foreign policy the military intelligence collection and analysis prisons and the corrections system public health and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film if you believe however that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination i think you'll find much to appreciate in this film nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping well deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be
<START> in 1983 director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface ' starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles the story begins in may of 1980 when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states 125 000 left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hard working people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted but not all among the marielitos' who streamed into florida approximately 25 000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba's jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada ' scarface br br now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all wealth and power that was montana's dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro's goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana ' along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives and in short order montana sees to it that lopez's brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america br br lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and it's even more lucrative cocaine lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top ' with a cold blooded iron will montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before it's over he will realize the price for his dream and he'll pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what it's like to be the man and he will also know whether or not it was worth it br br in step with de palma's vision pacino plays montana larger than life and he does it beautifully from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude he's got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him it's quite simply a dynamic memorable performance br br michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montana's dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanor br br the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic ' and blow ' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah's the wild bunch ' de palma's scarface ' originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time but the reward is always worth it and that's the way it is with this film i rate this one 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war and it really happen not exactly as the movie but it is a great story i was impress by this film the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it's giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca rector that maruschka detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way i recommend that everybody have to see this film special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film this film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the ww2
<START> being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films some good and some bad but i would have to say that 'summer rain' is by far the worse film i have ever seen i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as 'secrets and lies' or 'lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education' school production the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start 'michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and gary was so wet he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes that by the end of the film i really didn't give a damn about either of them all i could think was ' i paid Â£3 for this pile' i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production so please avoid at all costs thanks for reading
<START> i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid so i didn't recall much of it as i watched it recently i sat there thinking this is the weirdest thing i've seen br br the 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose the animated characters are mostly oddly colored voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters some not so disney things i noticed kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes during the portobello road song br br it was very entertaining though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them also the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during ww2
<START> naturally i didn't watch 'gi jane' out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house br br gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isn't the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable br br 'gi jane' fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining 'gi jane' tries to be real and fails br br this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very non credible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it 2 10 instead of 1 10 is for some of the technical work
<START> if you like film don't miss this one if you prefer action or horror or romance then you'll wonder what's happening everyone here is stuck in a gangster film and what happens is transcendental murder br br there are few similar films no doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find but the search will be worth it if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol then this is indeed a film to study br br you can't watch it once if you do you'll never see what's happening dark city is better joe vrs the volcano is more fun but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism or at least to think twice before shooting again
<START> 'the rookie' was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience making them realize that your dreams can come true if you loved 'remember the titans' 'the rookie' is the movie for you it's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages 'the rookie' hits a major home run
<START> this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
<START> when many people say it's the worst movie i've ever seen they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like however of the nearly 700 movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry this is my first movie review by the way and i registered with imdb just to rave at this movie's badness i went to see it when it was in the theaters myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there and after 15 years i can't remember very many specifics but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear br br spoiler alert br br oh my where to begin fat loser left at altar goes on ski weekend meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him takes him home to meet the family they're all cannibals and he's the main course pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother's girlfriend they live happily ever after puke firstly the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny and that this was a comedy the special effects what few there are look like they were done 15 years earlier the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them i'm sure that there's much much more but i have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher
<START> good times working with the quiroz brothers and the entire cast on this project as the guy on the bench i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true b horror film hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer at the time it was renting more than ring2 which was also a new release at the time the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya jaysun barr guy on the bench 2005
<START> there's plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying sequences period costumes props and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire in this bunch of catty snobs we found only one character who is at all likable Â a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their malicious schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining even the dog is detestable we threw in the towel after two of the six episodes so you should discount these observations accordingly but what i could find written about this mini series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
<START> definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos iman's appearance is especially self deprecating it's also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos typecast themselves
<START> when his in laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend forced to take the rap by the gang to tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way br br the decoy is a real life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films it's talky illogical slow and ultimately very boring br br there's some good costumes sets and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer director producer star justin kreinbrink who apparently had too much money on his hands br br they used to make westerns like this that were under an hour long trim this of about half it's length and you might have something watchable
<START> you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so you'll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith and that is not my intention so my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh darn nice too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the church's beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film instead the people are almost cartoon like in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic the non mormons were all devils and brian donlevy playing exactly the same sort of role edward g robinson later played in the ten commandments is the trouble maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy it's all so very simple too simple almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial br br brigham young especially was a very complex man with many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad don't even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly it's also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley only the facts that led to his being almost super human were emphasized heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious films they often come off as one dimensional trite and bland let's have a full and more complete film of these men one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals br br now if you can ignore the fact that you won't learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough it's obvious someone at 20th century fox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors tyrone power up and coming actors linda darnell jane darwell and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger john carradine and brian donlevy the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss it just didn't have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups talk of gold in california even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn't be discovered until 1948 as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smith's many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene and no one seemed to care even though it was a very hostile audience don't you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it br br one final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when it's shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop ups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market after all who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others
<START> i watched this movie on the grounds that amber benson rocks and nick stahl is generally pretty cool i figured that any film featuring two actors i like and respect couldn't be all bad and in that sense i was right considering the cringe making dialogue they were given both of them perform reasonably well not well enough to stop the movie from sucking you understand but well enough that i was able to make it through the 75 odd minutes of movie and that's the main sign of an awful film when at 40 minutes through you're already praying for it to be over br br it's hard to know where to start with the problems in taboo the dialogue as mentioned is appalling wooden and completely unnatural january jones' acting is unbelievably bad and since she's the character we spend most of our time following around the house this is an unforgivable flaw the plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clichÃ©d as to be completely predictable literally not one of the major 'twists' in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler a few interesting shots aside the director tries far too hard with far too little success awkward tracking shots and jittery camera work distracting from what little element of story there is br br three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains amber benson and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone ever under any circumstances avoid at all costs
<START> i have to admit that i'm a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but nooooooo a maniac wants to destroy arnold's house between many other places so many people tries to stop this br br i must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold gerald and helga 'cause they are experts on a video game br br honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon but after this crap of movie i'm not quite sure if i'm going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the past br br other thing nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don't do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good br br honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie
<START> in this movie the old amitabh bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again he meets her in his restaurant the younger woman tabu flirts with him he does not know what to do and asks her out her reaction on his invitation is rather weird is was supposed to be funny br br and that annoys me about this whole movie it wasn't that funny the jokes and script was terrible the only jokes i liked was about the teeth of a waiter but after a several times even that began to bore br br amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy this was a weird relationship a little girl with the mind of an old woman it was frightening i know someone can be attached to a kid but this man has adult conversations with this child it did not make any sense br br tabu's father is paresh rawal he has to give amitabh a hard time but we all know paresh he can't do that so even the conversation at the end when they sit all around the table even that was supposed to be funny br br i only like movies who really are funny i suppose i will never watch this movie again
<START> i think dark angel is great first season was excellent and had a good plot with max jessica alba as an escaped x 5 manticore creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice br br the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first the plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of it's charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing don't get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the manticores however they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of br br so i really wish they could start making new episodes and with james cameron behind this it can't go wrong so as a conclusion i would say it's a great series however i'm still hoping for a third season
<START> enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
