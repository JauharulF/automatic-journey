<START> i went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb with such a low expectation any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise the soundtrack was the best part of the movie but poking fun at the nonsense that goes on in singles wards was also amusing br br this said there were many things about the singles ward that were completely annoying the entire film was poorly dubbed and made watching mouths while listening to their voices very irritating this lack of professionalism was surpassed only by the cameos of mormon celebrities who have no business acting br br this film will do well among mormondom especially in college communities where singles ward exist however the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried only the pretty girls in the singles ward get married the fat ugly ones don't but all the ugly men do ultimately we realize that the whole film was an advertisement for ldssingles com
<START> vulpine massacre should have been this movies actual title and the tag line should have read guaranteed to make your kids cry this is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den giving insight into the animals loves and lives lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals sounds good huh well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core br br spoilers below or they it may be a warning br br almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind but seems to get along well enough and there's a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him and then he dies next we have one of the siblings adventures and then he dies one of the sisters gets her screen time and then she dies and so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and vanish and even by a bunch of snowmobiles by the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen least not in the version we saw unlike say tarka the otter the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out one or two losses would have been acceptable it is a nature film after all but not nearly the whole family br br do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids watch it with some foreknowledge that things are not going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are you may enjoy it or you may not
<START> i've seen a great many films but 'in cold blood' stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the black white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood
<START> how this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before no one seems to be grounded in the real world the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down the hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbing not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic finally for a movie about l a being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly boring what a shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them sadly it wouldn't have taken much
<START> the premise sucked me in but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece romero comes to mind but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 or simply get a lobotomy jennifer what happened to ya and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc i like to think that god is a little greater than that
<START> this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg danny glover in addition to that have always trusted respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles grand canyon for example i just could not finish this movie after what seemed an eternity but was probably just a little over an hour we had to turn it off there was no comedy there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited confusing and unnecessary what could have been a great idea for a movie even as a drama not a comedy although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better because i love to watch white people freak out start acting like complete idiots it makes me laugh became a waste of my 1 credit at the video store
<START> as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was available br br the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ping pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i found myself muting much of those scenes br br oh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it br br i can't recommend this trash to anyone it's not even the good bad movie it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true
<START> one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film and i've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies too the actors the beautiful settings locations and surroundings the deep emotions portrayed the sweet songs especially the singing voice of udit narayan my favorite everything was just lovely the human imperfect element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution alok nath is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise
<START> complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didn't most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
<START> i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday the episode with hilton's eccentric genius brother george played by the late roscoe lee browne is classic hilarity it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy br br mr cosby and ms rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists br br the roster of comedic dynamite madeline kahn phylicia rashad and mr cosby classic genius
<START> the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy it's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldn't have expected him in and he pulled it off well br br hanks' good performance aside though i certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasn't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster largely raised by rooney paul newman who's a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of father son bonding movie br br although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story it's really very dark throughout that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks' performance the movie as a whole just didn't pull me in 4 10
<START> dr k david h hickey has been trying to master a formula that would end all disease and handicaps but needs live donors to complete his work his doctor brother richard dennis o'neill has a son named eddie derek philips who is accepted to medical school eddie has a girlfriend named sarah lizabeth cardenas who is pre law and plans to attend law school herself the coming fall she and eddie resume their relationship when sarah calls things off with her current boyfriend who is also shagging the lady of walt bill sebastian eddie's best friend who recently paid for his cheating girlfriend's boob job eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the throes of death when dr k makes a suggestion to richard let him recuperate eddie using his secret illegal methods when dr k applies his serum to eddie horrifying results occur eddie's face bulges massive warts while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh many will die so that eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite he can't quench soon he may even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend eddie monster must be stopped br br typically awful direct to video horror flick suffers from a severe lack of budget acting and overall talent the premise which seems like an interesting fright fest fails to deliver even as a zombie flick the gore is limited with a few munching scenes but most of the violence occurs off camera the use of time to move the story along can really get annoying
<START> this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show but i remembered this as being live action i don't think i ever saw the cartoon but movie maybe i remember it very clearly the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom he even had the red jacket it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him the car guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street and then proceeded to drive off that is all i remember i really hope someone else out there remembers this too if not maybe i'm still crazy but i'm hoping i'm not
<START> based on christy brown's autobiographical novel this endearing film tells the story of his life him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother amazingly he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot which is the only part of him he can control an amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by daniel day lewis 9 of 10
<START> while filming an 80's horror movie called 'hot blooded' the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer after all of this the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film from this it's labelled as a cursed production not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role but not as the daughter but the mother but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer br br look what 'scream' started hey i enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses during this stage the sub genre came back with vengeance but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise 'cut' which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick but you know what i found it a cheesy delight yeah it's gawd awful and highly forgettable but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted although i did hate it when i originally came across it but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again but this time it wasn't so sweet br br the film came out around the same time as 'scream 3' and 'urban legends the final cut' did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie 'scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut though it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of scream's bastard offspring pretty much the film is given b grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense while the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it she plays the wash up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send up performance she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars that's if you're an australian with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts also pop singer and supposed actress kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up nice these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue because they have no real substance to be there br br the plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden u turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinkingÂ oh my this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way but don't you just love an opening ending also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential tongue in cheek approach predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over stated at times but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness the cinema scene is done rather nicely too br br now now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but it's more then decent for such low budget flick there are one or two creative deaths but the rest are systematic the killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought well the smart ass attitude didn't sit well with me another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut away editing out of place soundtrack and kimble rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness br br the imagination matches the budget that's for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else pure schlock that's slightly amusing
<START> it was extremely low budget it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder however it does have a good plot line and its easy to follow 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard then she see's her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for and you'll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not overall good movie reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part
<START> two old buddies are sent to japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie first they just have to learn some ninja skill because only ninja can beat the ninja br br sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja flick but fails that badly the whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before characters are too briefly drawn direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising even in the ending scene which by itself reduced movie's trash value br br even 80's ninja flick fan who understands the esthetic of trash movies is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable it simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer neither in visual level nor in plot shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes br br it's hard to recommend movie to anyone even franco nero's clumsy performance in enter the ninja falls behind sakura killer's american ninjas even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie there isn't any in all one of the most futile ninja flicks i've ever seen doesn't interest even in curiosity trust me on this one br br Â½ out of 10
<START> the third fred macmurray carole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across it's yet another adaption of the play burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day br br the original play burlesque ran on broadway in the 1927 1928 season for 372 performances and it's the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck originated on broadway that brought her to hollywood a version starred nancy carroll in the early days of talkies and later on betty grable and dan dailey did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at me br br in fact i have a vinyl album of a radio version that al jolson and ruby keeler did for the lux radio theater that's an interesting work believe me br br anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old chestnut the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz trumpeter note a nice performance by dorothy lamour as the latin vixen who gets between fred and carole also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombard br br swing high swing low holds up real nice today and i wouldn't be surprised if we see yet another version of burlesque for the twenty first century
<START> i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the story line was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you're into super geeky cheese romantic scenes you'll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like dr spock unable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you're up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real story's much more interesting though br br if i had to sum up this film in one word it would be br br lame
