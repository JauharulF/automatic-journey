<START> anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie soylent green are far better choices than those series soylent is probably science fiction 's best kept secret it remains one of the biggest yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day charlton heston overdramatizes his role yet it works edward g robinson in his final role makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching br br it is manhattan in 2022 the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune a small jar of strawberry jam costs 150 a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case br br the secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie soylent is enjoyable to watch but the whole screenplay is a joke it is just as cheap as the entire production the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie yet were completely hilarious everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants the character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie but still you realize that soylent green sucks an enjoyable piece if you have the time but do not expect anything more
<START> in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies this is amusing at first but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable br br characters often interact in a peculiar way with no tact or manners or respect i believe this is intentional not bad acting after all who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that br br i didn't like most of the action scenes apart the death of the priest too cheap even for the seventies the plot isn't too polished but the great scenes and ideas like the death of sol the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with the furniture outweigh the shortcomings of this film br br 8 out of 10
<START> what a disappointment especially in light of the budget provided the technical resources available and the talent assembled isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief poa 2001 creates a plausible beginning suckering us in but thereinafter mr burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains the over the top libertarian of helena bonham carter's chimp the worthlessness of the humans' lockup the ease of their escape their extraordinary skills of horsemanship this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable mark wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down compare to the original in which chuck heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events the uniformed wahlberg preserves his modesty but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation and we never really wonder about his well being unlike heston he seems never to be in real jeopardy tim burton should have used some of the f x budget for some competent screenwriting in fact after this inferior fiasco i wonder why hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats let them walk trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in planet of the apes 2001 i'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent it could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination another opportunity lost
<START> certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator
<START> if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme 95 style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up it's just boring pretentious twaddle br br the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme 95 overseas it'll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy it's called dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera br br
<START> in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice br br michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock central australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area no one believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an accessory after the fact the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing the chamberlain's trial was over before it began br br lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the chamberlains should have been acquitted br br fred schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson's novel that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock br br schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay his screenplay co written with robert caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred br br the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was streep's is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part br br technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the rock editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce smeaton provides a telling score br br for all aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said i don't think anybody really understands what innocence means to innocent people br br saturday may 20 1995 video br br even on return viewings fred schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980 is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving br br schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson's novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down br br amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence br br meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn't cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling support br br editing from jill bilcock is very timely ian baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton's music is perfect for the part truly a must for all conscientious australians br br sunday june 15 1996 video
<START> in the aftermath of watergate a number of conspiracy movies appeared such as this one written by the late adam kennedy based on his novel br br gene hackman plays ex vietnam veteran 'roy tucker' a loser who has wound up in prison he receives visits from marvin tagge richard widmark who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted they offer him freedom and despite distrusting tagge he accepts but he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of spiventa mickey rooney exactly why is hard to see as spiventa is an irritating little man who drives tucker mad with persistent talk of sex not what you want to hear when you are behind bars br br tagge's benefactors kill spiventa before tucker's astonished eyes reunited with wife ellie candice bergen and given a new identity strangely he does not attempt to change his appearance shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start he settles down but finds there is a catch tagge wants tucker to do no less than assassinate the president of the united states he refuses so tagge has ellie abducted br br i will leave the synopsis here but i am sure you can guess the rest for yourself the script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book neat trick that the people tagge represents are never revealed the allusions to j f k 's killing are unmistakable despite the findings of the warren commission the doubt as to whether lee harvey oswald acted alone persists to this day br br this was stanley kramer's first movie in years and while no turkey it lacks the grip of say john frankenheimer's 'the manchurian candidate' or alan j pakula's 'the parallax view' being a left wing conspiracy movie it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it i prefer right wing ones myself they are funnier 'domino' has the look and feel of a made for t v movie and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the michael caine classic 'get carter' br br what makes it watchable are gene hackman and richard widmark the latter who sadly passed away earlier this year is superb as the mysterious tagge who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall just like dominoes as tucker the innocent pawn hackman is marvellous you have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place in his shoes i'd have fled to the other side of the world anywhere to get away from these fanatics hackman's love scenes with bergen slow the plot down and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched presumably the producers thought so too which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise voiced by british actor patrick allen warning the audience that 'they' are out there and that 'they' are out to get us comedian les dawson later spoofed this opening in his b b c show 'the dawson watch' br br mickey rooney had earlier worked with kramer on 'its a mad mad mad mad mad world' his 'death' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead br br conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left but now the right are getting in on the act too last year 'taking liberties' an absurd concoction of lies and half truths about tony blair's government turned out to be britain's answer to 'reefer madness' at least 'domino' had lovely candice bergen the best chris atkins' film could offer was anne widdecombe br br surprisingly 'the domino principle' was made by sir lew grade the legendary british television mogul behind 'the saint' 'jesus of nazareth' and 'the muppet show' he worked with adam kennedy again in 1980 on 'raise the titanic ' whose failure was so great it sank grade's ambitions of being the new louis b meyer being somewhat open minded i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy
<START> smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life's great mysteries d
<START> i couldn't have been more thrilled just eight years old back in 1983 i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater the best day of my life was about to happen to that time my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet br br and boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes jabba big rebel spaceships the emporer a green bladed lightsaber wow since that magical day i must have watched this movie hundreds of times i can't even form an accurate estimate at this point with those multiple viewings i have of course observed that this movie the real episode iii does have its flaws br br of course in the context of a star wars movie those flaws are more like quirks br br millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 in may of 1983 i had mine and this was my star wars movie
<START> yes this movie is a real thief it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to boost the acceptance support for the wars u s is still fighting today i do not really want to go here into politics but come on this is more clear than the summer sky hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding no real plot at all i really feel myself in the 50's of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like the same propaganda movies were produced that time only with the exception that those were black and white even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the u s wars are cool genre you surely have much better movies to choose from
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival based on a novella by science fiction author brian aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band br br almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if you'll pardon the pun by mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha lose their way pretty quickly i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much plus the promised rock and roll just didn't move me i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch a film i found original and moving but in this case the songs just weren't as good nor were the main characters sympathetic a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine
<START> a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my time br br he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the 1970's hit tv series 'the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characters tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
<START> godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi's take on tolkien's magnum opus the lord of the rings has actually been made by peter jackson the recent trilogy to me aren't even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments br br but as one who has not read the books i end up now looking upon the two versions live action albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books and with bakshi's version it's almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what jackson really had probably final cut robbed of return of the king's big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointing br br what's interesting too after seeing the jackson films first which i also slightly regret being that i might've reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf br br the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context but there is some level of interest always with the characters and here there's a more old fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more this is not a garden variety disney adaptation warts and all this is a bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth br br and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation in some parts yeah it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in bakshi's american pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comic book form done in a different way still there's much i admired in what was done br br the orcs for example i found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings they're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live action especially during parts where there isn't battle footage that's really the real hit or miss section as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback it's creepy in a good way and the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together it's almost something for art film buffs as much as for the ring nuts br br so how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings i don't know to tell the truth it's certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i've seen the hobbit and i've yet to see the animated rotk and there is some real artistry going on there's also some stilted dialog an all too rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films br br if you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out i would say it's worth a chance even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement where as with lynch's dune it's bound to draw a dark mordor like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't i don't
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies of the year the plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid it all begins when michael keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman loses his beautiful author wife anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible vw bugs even though she's supposed to be rich in his grief batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby recording nothing and then watching it he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his tv pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to evp or electronic voice phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones anna cell calling but she's dead must be ghosts mhmmm no other possible explanation i'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately etc why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained anyway eventually batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know he gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves d mn it can travel between the living and dead using electronics but i'll be d mned if we can be on time am i right guys they nod in bemused agreement he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie look hard or you'll miss him is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in raiders of the lost ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are just then some detectives show up and save the lady after batman's funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of evp is to expose him to it the little kid just smiles nothing phases that dude not even when his dad batman of course starts talking to tv's the high point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out it's anna
<START> this movie is outrageous funny ribald sophisticated hits the bullseye where 99 of hollywood movies don't even make the target paul bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era he's the american renoir bunuel combined glad i have the videodisc
<START> saturday june 3 6 30pm the neptune br br monday june 5 4 30pm the neptune br br few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura's brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz' masterpiece iberia suite at the approach of its centennial saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland the twelve impressions of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura's camera creative use of large flats and mirrors moved throughout the set combined with screens shadows fire rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song dance and instrumental performance photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program connecting the passion of the music to its great creator saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors
<START> ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her ex lover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting br br i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes a convoluted semi historical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally i don't mind dark movies but the absence of light the bone jarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad film making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i don't think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability br br the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator br br all in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he 2 10
<START> this movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month i've watched it a dozen or more times and it never ceases to delight me if it was on tomorrow i'd watch it again such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith two great magicians of the acting profession can create helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden bob newhart and robert morley not forgetting others in minor roles br br it is a simple tale simply told of an ex con a lovable embezzler battling and succeeding with the then new age technology i e computers and finding affection in the process even if it is a tad tongue in cheek implausible even unbelievable the characters are not there is no violence no sex no bad language and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today a real lesson to modern movie makers on how to make a great show from and with virtually nothing except outstanding talent

<START> i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales a true aristocratic family it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family the money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper unforgettable
