<START> this complicated western was a milestone in the career of james stewart after his return from war service wanting to change his image by doing a western which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the '50s since it's very impressive too bad it wasn't photographed in technicolor br br stewart wins first prize for the gun that won the west but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen shelley winters is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and stephen mcnally is the local bad boy gunman in dodge city will geer is wyatt earp and dan duryea is shelley's bad boyfriend and wouldn't you know that it being a universal international film tony curtis and rock hudson both quite unknown at the time have bit roles br br an interesting sequence features the first indian attack whereby charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off leaving shelley alone in the horse drawn wagon he later redeems himself but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another but finally ending up with the rightful owner br br stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as duel in the sun's blazing guns finale mcnally makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the '40s as a low life gunslinger br br tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann and it's fun to see rock hudson credited as young bull wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive shelley winters br br well worth viewing and definitely an above average story
<START> the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't director james cameron from 'the terminator' did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is 'the dinner table' scene in which rose's family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the one' i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband br br jack and rose have a connection that is 'movie stuff' but it's good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk br br the movie is long but it's fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it
<START> from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie the poster is possibly the funniest i've ever seen for a movie i immediately bought one for my dorm this september br br every element came together in this movie so beautifully it's not often you see a movie with so many penis gay and racial jokes so praised by critics carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid the supporting cast is brutal each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves br br one of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given this is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly this movie will often be brought up when the words chest waxing and condoms are mentioned in conversation br br watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it i saw a group of four mid 60s women come in despite an older audience this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter br br i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on family guy too the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women br br i don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended however when you are at the movie just remember this movie is all in good humor the jokes aren't gay jokes they're just jokes and they're funny
<START> at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup br br that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay br br the city's top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis's henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat but caprice's moves are making him a target for tracy br br in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself will our hero sort out this thicket of crime br br the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious when people like al pacino dustin hoffman paul sorvino william forsythe r g armstrong get themselves outrageously made up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham you've got to love this film br br al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor but any of these guys could have it's only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time only beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him dick tracy won oscars for best art set design best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna sooner or later the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun as for madonna the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney br br before this film dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl can you believe a cast like bing crosby bob hope frank sinatra dinah shore jimmy durante judy garland frank morgan and the andrews sisters try and find a recording of that gem br br until then warren beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely
<START> i saw the big bad swim at the 2006 temecula film festival and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into it br br the film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons a humorous idea in its own right the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives br br what surprised me about the film was how real it felt rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely and the drama that took place outside was very poignant nothing seemed out of place or out of character and ultimately it left a very strong feeling much like attending school or summer camp where you find fast friends form strong bonds and make discoveries about yourself yet have to depart all too soon br br my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed i suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class though br br aside from this i found the film very well rounded and quite enjoyable see it if you get the opportunity
<START> 'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli' such was ned's bravery br br in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there br br many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited br br evidence of all the events in the movie except for his love interest can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify neds actions the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it br br the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is ned's biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
<START> original claymation rudolph pretty good original frosty cartoon needs a little work but could be worse but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july c'mon give me a break this was one movie that shouldn't have been made it was bad it didn't really go for any holiday in particular except july 4 that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph are usually associated with the christmas season and any movie can be ruined by too much singing the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime characters with an american traditional holiday which almost seems to limit it to america too many pointless songs and a lousy plotline the result a bad movie that can't really be watched at any time of year i would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like frosty and rudolph
<START> with all the european studios involved in this one you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a minimum br br irritation 1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop wtf the story is hopelessly confused there's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused is she or isn't she a lesbian serving no purpose whatsoever the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time there seems to be some message about the mid '30s spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead one doesn't see the point in it br br despite the bull fighting backdrop of part of the narrative which part who can tell you never even get a good look at a bull fight earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose with my blessings
<START> this film tries to be immensely clever and tarantino like br br before you try that though you need solid filmic fundamentals these include good sound editing set design etc br br lets talk about the sound in this movie absolutely atrocious i have never been more distracted by a sound track ever br br and before we talk about low budget film made in chile etc lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been anywhere and more info on technique is available then ever before br br the sound in this movie is plain bad the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout the atmos is equally terrible i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie which are the result of poor sound editing the sound inside cars is awful the sound of car doors closing is awful the sound of the lady singing is wrong foley is either overboard or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up the spaces are wrong everything about it is wrong br br and yet not letting limitations of creativity get in the way at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene we hear sound when we're not supposed to sound edits precede visual cuts every trick in the book is used and yet the foundations are just not there br br editing wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc yawn all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard br br overall the mix is crap the sound is crap and so the film is crap how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise chile's cinematic new wave the best creative output that chile has to offer i hope not and i think not br br my theory is that chile's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risquÃ© content equally the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called 'world cinema' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons they likely revel in it's trashiness of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality br br this film is rubbish it's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6 8 rating the film has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino new wave inspired porno
<START> this movie was laughably bad a friend rented it from netflix and made me watch it there are so many gaffes and goofs that it's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot how about these for example br br the vermont airport surrounded by palm trees br br ben's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversation br br the priest's palatial office complete with a folding card table desk br br there is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie but even if you look past the technical flaws you'll find horrid acting and casting i was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the right wing religious zealot brother his opening scene sitting in his immaculate apartment stroking his kitty cat was hilarious br br i applaud the writer director producer editor star caterer cast dentist composer and whatever else he did on this move for actually getting a movie like this distributed if you have nothing better to do it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but don't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage
<START> what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes it's arty and yes it's foreign but that's not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly made br br the people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for them br br the violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous it's like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him either br br and oh yes if i had neighbours like these i'd move
<START> it's interesting how the train of research can flow i started out looking at an article about cristo's the gates in central park the article stated that the maysles had been cristo's filmographers for years hmmm then i got to looking at their body of work i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation grey gardens sounded very interesting video station in boulder co is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock dvd and vhs edith and edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past it was edith had been well off born a bouvier married well had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties her daughter edie had been a dÃ©butante a fashion model and had many beaus she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind worrying too much about things it is only a shadow of the world they live in though because jackie o came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out but in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude but she doesn't in the movie edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings tea for two edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56 it was a good movie though not for everyone when the cat is urinating behind edith's portait she states at least someone is doing what they want
<START> the final pairing of nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald is basically a complete misfire the script is weak and has been presented badly the film just has no life in it eddy and macdonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing there's nothing wrong with their singing its just everything else in this turkey thats overcooked
<START> first of all for this movie i just have one word 'wow' this is probably one of the best movies that touched me from it's story to it's performances so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni i was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie the story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity if you have the chance see it because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for many time simply amazing 9 10
<START> has anyone been able to buy this movie my uncle hutch was a real not reel pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings br br he's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie he was killed in a dogfight over italy he was only 24 at the time do we know the film studio that made it br br or has anyone seen it at a video store like blockbuster i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd's these days br br please email me at nfny40 yahoo com if you know where i can buy a copy thank you
<START> i never met a single person out of hundreds who hated this movie bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur or a victim of one this film has everything ask yourself are you a fan of then go see laputa br br it's not my favorite movie but my favorite is directed by the same person hayao miyazaki in any case this one ranks among my top five and i've seen a lot of movies
<START> i guess i am coming late to the party i just saw this 1995 version of bye bye birdy on sky tv i didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when i turned it on br br i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do i was not impressed with this newer version it just wasn't enough fun it was not colorful it lacked the exuberance of youth the lighting was bad no one seemed to mention this fact this is not a moody musical it is bright and up beat the lighting decision was a poor creative choice br br bye bye birdy is a farce a comedy of errors i got no sense of that in this version the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances the dance numbers seemed anemic as well we do have music videos these day at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those or how about some of the best of broadway the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed br br although all the actors were supremely talented there were some really bad casting choices vanessa williams is not latin and with so many talented latin performers out there wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie vanessa is african american lovely and talented but bad casting jason alexander's effort was astounding he always does intelligent work but he just wasn't albert he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version br br the medium of film is not the medium of stage there needs to be translation from one medium to another the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed the spirit the essence of the production must be brought forth to me the 1963 film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people
<START> what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other br br this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene br br if you haven't seen this movie it is essential check it out
<START> the good thing about this movie the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing its a small world and this little movie shows us br br the bad thing there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie br br its a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven't seen br br 8 10 br br not rated i would rate it pg 13 for brief violence some language and sexual situations
<START> i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb but i went to see it anyway because i am a big fan of bible related material first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van dien didn't see those jones movies through but he should i believe he tried his best but script just stunk music tried to be kinda jones style too great work but for such movie it seemed like too much work like the video part did't deserve all that great music robert wagner gave his best acting skills he did a good job but somehow the script was bringing everything down jokes are old school somewhere 20 years old they brought only cynic smile to my face there are some really bad camera angels sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story in my opinion but i love such stories but things just didn't work out in the end maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head when i in first minutes saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies' i hoped that i will at least 'hear' a good story but sometimes movies just disappoint
