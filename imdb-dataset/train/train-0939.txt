<START> macy ullman and sutherland were as great as usual ritter wasn't bad either what's her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie to bad the plot was atrocious it was completely predictable trite and boring br br from the first 15 minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting which was a pity br br finally too bad the script writer wasn't the victim especially with the precocious lines from the child which were completely unbelievable br br again it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score
<START> two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets a slimy south american drug lord and a prominent general br br moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller taking it's time establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat some detours here don't add up to much but this film is far better than his stallone stone travesty the specialist br br billy zane usually incredibly tiresome does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels
<START> i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama in the same vein as remember the titans however i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie actually one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment at least with the televangelist sermon there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self help pulp the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie
<START> shiner directed by christian calson centers around three couples and their relationships with obsession and violence pretty good start as far as i'm concerned interesting the couples break down into a heterosexual couple two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being harmlessly stalked by a gay man br br the het couple really don't have much of a role in the film there are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized my assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex violence are integrated in a couples life the couple aren't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way as characters they don't add much to the theme or plot br br the two male friends make up the bulk of the plot they engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley this escalates into violence and the violence changes them it becomes a means of sexual gratification and their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses the main problem i had is the violence is not convincing never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger it just doesn't work given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence this is a major problem unfortunately the make up doesn't help either sometimes it's okay other times it is very bad in one scene i really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face confusing br br the more interesting pair of the characters is the stalker couple here calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two br br i appreciate that calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film it is admirable most low budget flicks don't aspire to much i don't think calson achieved want he was aiming for myself i found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling shiner was unconvincing this doesn't mean however that the director can't achieve something with his next film br br he seems to have something to say
<START> the acting is bad ham all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children assuming they have below average iqs i realize that it was meant for kids but so is malcom in the middle yet they still throw in adult humor and situations br br what should we expect from a show lead by bob saget the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a man's groin which is probably why he stopped hosting america's funniest home videos br br parents do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer
<START> belmondo is a tough cop he goes after a big time drug dealer played by henry silva normally a great villain see sharky's machine but here he is clearly dubbed and because of that he lacks his usual charisma he goes to the scuzziest places of paris and marseilles asks for some names beats up some people gets the names goes to more scuzzy places asks for more names beats up more people etc the whole movie is punch after punch after punch it seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the french equivalent of dirty harry belmondo who was 50 here does perform some good stunts at the beginning apart from those le marginal is a violent episodic trite shallow and forgettable cop movie 1 2
<START> how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you can't stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so i'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all br br some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes br br one of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on that's actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n' giggles and the eyes actually move br br but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad br br i hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film you'll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though don't' bother
<START> some gorehound friends recommended live feed to me and basically i can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the so called torture porn ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick twisted make up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co eds tried up suffering and begging for their lives there's no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twenty something friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun they're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply apology clearly doesn't suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if you're used to watching independent fan boy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental s m executioner is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dim witted losers go right ahead and watch
<START> remember the name kevin lime and please please never let br br him direct again timing pacing editing all hopelessly wrong br br three or four decent professionals next time guys walk off the br br set can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like alice br br evans and the kind of production standards you'd expect from br br teen produced children's shows on british tv br br greatest mystery the music a score so inept inappropriate and br br ill matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is br br a case of sabotage add an acoustic that booms apparently br br unengineered from a single mike and a director who only br br intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen and we br br have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of br br recent years
<START> i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles after the film lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them i can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland sweden the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see even people who don't normally go to subtitled films definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small town community with everyday people it is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit a must see
<START> what can i say i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya soraj have always been different movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find love and joint family that loving and great vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage shahid has done fine work anupamji as always brilliant amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role we've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras and main ho on na so quit different role that she isn't in to she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role anyways great going work by barjatya this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot sweet film of the year great music and lyrics i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original soraj's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him great work by all the cast the crew and everybody lovely family film to enjoy with your parents siblings friends and love ones i give it 10 out of 10
<START> barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story br br to have a chance at obtaining an education babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy anyway at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she's a guy br br don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs' male friend thinks she's a man but pins 'him' to the ground sits on top of 'him' and looks affectionately into 'his' eyes snicker br br mediocre film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting
<START> absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill researched it's ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that it's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age br br the worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world br br if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but it's not a high quality film so i just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is br br i would have given it 0 10 if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
<START> if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece how could it be worse more you ask well at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra other than updated graphics modern day themes such as terrorists modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene line in the story was going and for anyone that didn't see the first one well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again
<START> i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh's performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why u s actors were not cast in this film i second that notion it's wonderful when actors actresses wish to expand their horizons but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but he's a such a great director br br well i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man
<START> i've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i've seen from the house of bruckheimer the casting especially of the younger officers was spot on and the script and editing the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour d'force if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best i hope there's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated because i'm sure i'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around
<START> this movie was made for people who found gremlins too serious and critters to hardcore like many of the critters trolls gremlins movies of the 80's this movie is bad the sad part is that there's no punchline to that comment it's just bad and not in a funny way br br the problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as howie mandell was in walk like a man what made the other 80's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary but were hilarious because they failed so miserably someone must have told bettina hirsch yes the bettina hirsch she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie unfortunately they were wrong br br sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the lost boys is amusing but not enough to save the movie br br by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character his paul reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy not that i did that br br so the bottom line is run don't walk to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves
<START> ealing studios a television and film production company based in west london claims to be the oldest film studio in the world though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces many starring the great alec guinness such well known titles include 'whisky galore 1949 ' 'passport to pimlico 1949 ' 'kind hearts and coronets 1949 ' 'the lavender hill mob 1951 ' 'the titfield thunderbolt 1953 ' and 'the ladykillers 1955 ' one of ealing studio's most beloved films 'the man in the white suit ' was released in 1951 and starred alec guiness as sidney stratton a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends br br sidney stratton is poor and unappreciated but he has scientific talent in great abundance due to his under qualification the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company's own money and equipment after being found out and ejected countless times sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry encouraged by his daughter daphne joan greenwood textile mill owner alan birnley cecil parker takes a keen interest in sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth shattering explosions sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation an almost luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out br br if sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero then he was sorely disappointed the all powerful bosses of textiles industry headed by the frail sir john kierlaw ernest thesiger unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention which could completely cripple their businesses never goes into full scale production likewise the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence fearing for their jobs the inventor however is convinced that the ever lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many and refuses to give in to the demand of others despite being threatened with violence and offered â¤250 000 in compensation throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support birnley's daughter daphne who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with sidney's plight anyway br br 'the man in the white suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy made great by a witty script written by john dighton roger macdougall and director alexander mackendrick and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable alec guinness there are also a few good natured swipes at capitalism and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate
<START> this movie had me going the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors band together and plan to take out the zombies dead wrong it's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation br br first off the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face what are zombies but mindless debatable intelligent cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies sure the eating and killing is there but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre it makes fun of that genre and asks the question why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much it's an insult and as for scaryÂnot even
<START> this is the sorriest collection of clichÃ©s strung together on a straight line with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i've seen in a long time canibalising scenes from star wars reign of fire godzilla lord of the rings and harry potter it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence was this movie good it wasn't a movie at all br br even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy the movie does offer some laughs the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films gandalf can be funny talking korean the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jaja bing or whatever his name was br br bottom line any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers not on the director writer shame on you shim
