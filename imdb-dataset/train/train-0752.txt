<START> feh this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living people pusses both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been better br br maybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesn't come to pass even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girl's spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as she'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle at which point i was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girl ewwww the robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and that's it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over the top cheesy face make up no screaming mimis i was very disappointed
<START> lily mars a smalltown girl living in indiana dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show lily follows unknown to john of course and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show's leading lady isabel rekay jealous when isabel gets fed up with the john lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and john decides to make lily the star isabel returns later and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance very charming film and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role her reading of lady macbeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career i enjoyed heflin's character thornway more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film rating 7
<START> in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully i use quotations for that word jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who can't seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film and i'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben hur length feature has to offer it's that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want br br what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jean pierre leaud has with the women around him he's a twenty something pseudo intellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie bernadette lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible love of his life left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika franÃ§oise lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but we're mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink in br br we're told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i can't say having not been alive in the period to see it first hand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions but eustache's point if not entirely message is that it's practically impossible to have it both ways you can't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with f ing as the characters refer over and over again br br the mother and the whore's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious though it could appear to be but that it's about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when they're ultimately alone in the morning br br if you thought films like before sunrise sunset were talky relationship flicks you haven't met this but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or 'deep' or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional it's never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who can't get enough of a good talky film it's exceptional while his style doesn't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustache's new wave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on them br br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can't ever perceive them as 'faking' an emotion or going at all into melodrama it's almost too good in naturalistic realism terms but for eustache's material there is no other way around it luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film's climax of sorts in one unbroken shot and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late parisian br br sad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i've seen from the country in general it's complex it's sweet it's cold it's absorbing and it's very long perhaps too long it's also satisfying on the kind of level that i'd compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film's release
<START> the movie 'gung ho ' the story of carlson's makin island raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war it shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda the value of this film is only collection and no artistic in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film if you want to see a film for the second world war they exist much better and objective i rated it 4 10
<START> i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of archie's life a mystery captured his humanity i don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone's life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves men become what they dream you have dreamed well good job to lord attenborough i also wanted to mention that nathaniel arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films
<START> shot in the heart is wonderful it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary gimore a convicted murder who requested death shot in the heart shows the ordeal that gilmore's family torn up by hatred went through this movie is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting 10 10
<START> the dentist is a really good thriller and pretty disturbing i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters vampires or zombies that's exactly why this movie is so scary during this film you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times whether he's capable of doing such things you better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him that's what the story is all about a respected dentist in la snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool boy that must be the greatest profession in the world by the way poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work from then on our dentist dr feinstone can only thing about taking revenge he can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax controller a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his at one point dr feinstone can't take it anymore now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him the dentist is written and directed by brian yuzna and co written by stuart gordon you can take that as a recommendation to itself these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies and personal favorites of mine like re animator from beyond and society with the dentist they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller this film came right on time actually the decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far i'm not at all saying this is a masterpiece but it's a nice change corbin bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor but he can sure handle a psychotic character the rest of the cast does good work too the woman who plays feinstone's wife is really attractive also it was great to see ken foree acting again the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film yuzna casted him in from beyond too 15 years ago and i thank him for that i don't recommend this movie to everyone if you have a weak stomach i'll advise you to skip it but if you do watch it you'll enjoy it very much you'll be disgusted but that's an extra reason i think it's been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film it's a great topic to handle in the genre and yuzna does it in a great way too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel my humble opinion on the dentist 8 10
<START> theo robertson has commented that waw didn't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler's rise and wwii br br perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period joined the hitler youth even and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in waw br br this documentary is so far above the history channel's documentaries i also own that there is no comparison br br the only fault and it is a small one that i have with waw is this the numbers are not included many times for instance if you're talking about lend lease then how much war material was lent leased how much to russia how much to britian how many merchant ships did the u boats sink and when how many ships did the german or japanese navy have total in 1941 what type were they how many troops how many troops did the allies have in total and by country lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off but i would have preferred more and naturally i always want to see more military analysis like why didn't patton clark trap the german army that was at cassini after they had it surrounded instead of racing monty to rome and letting it escape i don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on total war like the fire bombing of dresden it's like trying to understand auschwitz etc before you see the clips of the death camps you just can't wrap your head around it it's too unbelievable br br unknown at that time and of course unfilmed were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese including cannibalism read flyboys and some live vivisection of medical experimentation prisoners w o any anesthetic br br dave
<START> i am a youth pastor's wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didn't get it and i didn't enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
<START> have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is set br br it is certainly hard hitting and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene' the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments br br will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared br br totally agree with steve thomp's articulate and well thought out comments
<START> normally i have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened when it's done on purpose br br but this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done then realized they had 5 left to finish on br br i saw it on tbs i recommend you not spend money on it either if you catch it on tv watch all but the last 15 minutes then walk away and make your own ending in your mind br br really the movie would have been better if they had simply got away and come back with the state poice of feds only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone and by all appearances had never been there br br wish i had more thumbs so i could give that movie 4 thumbs down
<START> this straight to video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career as is the disney tradition quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash in this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man' when this kind of thing was done properly shockingly this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time
<START> one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than you'd think for this era and make the non fight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chan's police story i cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 1 3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary br br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 1 2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars kar leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy there's only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then there's this it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with br br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here won't dissuade you and if you don't you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this
<START> warning spoilers contained herein br br this is a semi autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island there's absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role and it shows she's just madonna playing madonna and she can't even get that right i know what you're saying you're saying how do you know this is what madonna is really like you've never met her correct i haven't but we all remember truth or dare don't we i know kevin costner does br br you would think in the year 2002 that madonna might have learned something one way or the other from the crossover ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen for goodness' sake hasn't madonna seen glitter mariah carey showed the film world how it is done mariah kicks madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty talent screen presence charisma characterization you name it all we see from this glimpse into madonna's world is she's the only one in it br br if there's one thing to be said for madonna it is that she's consistent when she was an mtv darling she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years now in film she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years by glamourizing all the most hated horrible reprehensible odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess br br here's the spoilers don't read any further if you don't want to know br br here's the one good thing i will say about this film and i really was impressed by it they didn't go for the hollywood ending madonna's character lives in the typical happy hollywood ending madonna's character would have died on the island and her long suffering oppressed whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good decent woman a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife and they both live happily ever after but in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued and once more this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife and his life will once again become a living hell br br here endeth the spoilers
<START> a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool it's all thrills and spills as the ex spy has to restart his career just as he's getting some serious r r cataloguing butterflies how british is that br br trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle upon tyne to liverpool via ullswater he's just been thrown out of mi5 or something and she you guessed it is on the run wrongly accused of murder there's seedy docks rolling lake district hills sheep country pubs coppers getting lost waterfalls a bunch of amateur cyclists rooftop chases and lots of chinamen don't ask and it's all very hitchcocky and hannayesque br br and a smashing example of british noir
<START> found this one in the video store and rented it it's one of those quirky quasi comedies that's more interesting and weird than funny it's a good one at that it reminds me a lot of being john malkovich if you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one
<START> this film was quite a surprise i wasn't expecting much to be honest greta garbo's first hollywood film so what probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm waving and facial contortions that low grade silent films so often show br br well was i mistaken greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me because this film made her a star and deservedly so she instinctively understood the power of just standing still or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen i kept thinking to myself how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film she was just years and years ahead of her time br br the story isn't all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost it is only the performance of garbo as leonora the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away that gives it life co star ricardo cortez is serviceable but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout at one point he is made to wear garbo's clothes leave in a huff then ignominiously return and give them back and let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife way too ordinary he didn't have much of a career after this and i can understand why but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonora's obsession br br there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all leonora you are becoming conspicuous yes conspicuous indeed br br if you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole film just watch the last 30 seconds or so garbo's glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything she must be so happy she has everything she wants yes garbo's face says it all about that i have to see this one again garbo is just amazing
<START> i saw this film on tv many years ago and i saw this film when i got this on tape i thought that this was reasonably well done it was not the best of all movies but it was good enough the movie has enough talent to inspire many people especially younger kids the acting was good with danny glover leading the cast the plot line was not very believable but the script was well written this movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans it does not directly apply to a action packed sports movie it directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film overall the film was good but not great i give this a movie a 7 10
<START> i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all
<START> the previous poster obviously worked on the movie it's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did mentioning all of the actors' names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he's involved with it in some way br br it's on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars the one called ava is gorgeous and well endowed were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason br br also when i first saw it i was sure it was made in about 1986 and i was born in '73 so i thought i knew what i was talking about but no it was made in 1993 unbelievable br br though i would call it one of those so bad it's good movies like watching a train wreck
