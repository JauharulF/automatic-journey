<START> im gonna make this short and sweet because i don't think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show ever br br you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes br br its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox mila kunis now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show
<START> i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it's his company but you're fired or you're hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve br br i'd love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that
<START> while movie titles contains the word 'mother' the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children br br however the mother tells a different story br br the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child here notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her br br before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond here he plays darren a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother and sleeping with her daughter as well anne reid who was a familiar face on tv series takes up the challenging role of the leading character may br br the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband toots in a family visit to her son bobby while she befriends darren a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby's house she was shocked to found out that her daughter paula was sleeping with darren at the same time may was coping with life after the death of toots fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her may starts to find her life going off track until she spends her afternoon with darren br br darren was nice and friendly to may and may soon finds some affection on darren instead of treating him like a friend she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple later may found sexual pleasure from darren where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family br br the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for br br anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series as she do not have much movies in her career resume the mother has put her on the critic's attention daniel craig on the other hand had took on a similar role in his movie career such as sylvia 2003 and enduring love 2004 if his reprising role of james bond fails film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career and the mother is one of them br br the mother may not be everyone's favorite but it is definitely not your usual matinÃ©e show to go along with tea and scones accompanied by butter and jam
<START> the only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to mind we all joined in br br this movie is soooo bad its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can invent lines and throw popcorn at
<START> the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel since the real star dolph lundgren would not be able to reprise his role from the original there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write off bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white to their credit they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role for once his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times and it does not get irritating the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films and therein lies the problem you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action you go because you want comedy however unintentional br br unbeknownst to many people universal soldier was followed by two direct to video sequels i have only seen the first which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career the sight of jean claude van damme comes as a welcome relief the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct to video sequels and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original after years of investigation and explanation the unisol project is still going ahead with some minor modifications for one the new unisols are stronger and more damage resistant than their earlier cousins for another all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth in the early parts of the film seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome br br being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut the unisol project is on the chopping block which essentially means that seth will be turned off seth somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down his only problem is that every so often a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown two individuals possess the code in question seth kills the first in short order and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be the rest of the film revolves around the unisols' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting br br the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichÃ©s when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness es gee seth you mean they will not be our strong points all kidding aside the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength it leaves the action without adequate setup in the original we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols how they work and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film here the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate at least in the original a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice here one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body getting up every time without stopping for breath br br i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner if you can see it on the cheap knock yourself out this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre
<START> the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too it was extremely funny angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet the parents are hilarious they are caterers as well as enemies the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart spoiler ahead i think they sneak off after a party and do it surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie if you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one
<START> this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one and i'm jewish br br anbody go to journalism school read an editorial freshman year rhetoric these alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable or any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe br br and thank goodness for that i wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap br br a good lesson for me and hopefully a cautionary tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it
<START> i was very impressed with this film i would have to rate it as one of the better classic era westerns i say that for the whole thing the acting mature dialog no nonsense story and excellent cinematography br br director anthony mann who did several well photographed film noirs around this same era also made some westerns such as this one it has that same film noir look mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period if you like this movie i recommend the mann stewart film bend of the river br br in a nutshell the story is about a man lin mcadam stewart who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle a weapon he won fair and square in a contest it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain all of those villains are interesting characters br br aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters dan duryea stephen mcnally millard mitchell charles drake will greer and j c flippen all of them are fun to watch it was a bit of a stretch however to see rock hudson playing an indian young bull but you can't have everything
<START> my take makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement br br the plot is familiar an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states the first traitor in the united states secret service as his fellow secret service agents pursue him he tries to prove his innocence of course we know his innocent and the real culprit is just around the corner but i was still entertained by the sentinel in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences the sentinel is a good lick back to all those good old fashioned political crime thriller the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances br br michael douglas the perfect man for the job is long running secret service agent pete garrison who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president former colleagues in the secret service kiefer sutherland and eva longoria pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service this leads to a lot of chase scenes that surprisingly and thankfully are never unbelievable the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady played by kim basinger this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films br br the films director is clark johnson s w a t who manages to make the film look good although many have criticized it as should have been a tv movie i must disagree agreed this is not a perfect film and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland but even so this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details the performances are terrific with a top notch cast its bound to be even with the by the numbers script br br all in all i award it 1 2 not perfect but not far from it br br rating 1 2 out of 5

<START> i'm one of those people who'd crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film from trust and iris to henry fool and my hartley favorite no such thing hal's unique brand of movies are an acquired taste infusing equal parts mystery espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte the comedy isn't in your face necessarily and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition and that's the case with fay grim the sequel to henry fool br br parker posey stars as fay grim abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry's only son ned fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen his name is fulbright jeff goldblum man of the year and he wants henry's notebooks there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings apparently there's much more to them secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists who knows but henry agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry and it works but not the way they think br br fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry's notebooks and to seek him out she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon james urbaniak out of prison he'd helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession spy rings shoot each other to death henry is discovered being held in safety by a jihadist fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son's life and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger br br hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes and he does so to the extreme here even character names grim fool fulbright fogg have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny the over the top espionage films of ol' are given plenty of screen time too as guns blaze in stop motion sequences never striking our heroine even though she's right in the line of fire br br now that i've heaped praise on this creation i will say that parker posey's excessive portrayal of fay grim isn't the best part of the film which is a shame considering how much time she's on screen i realize this was probably what mr hartley wanted an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme but it was still painful to watch at times br br even so fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more though this wasn't my favorite hal hartley film i know i'm ready
<START> god this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film it is a waste of time br br emraan can act but was really pathetic in this film i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie it was just really bad br br celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever she can't act at all and there was no point of her being in this film as for the other girl radha she was okay i guess but could have done better br br what a waste of time please buy the great music and don't watch this movie
<START> riveting drama scripted by william mastrosimone based on his stage play in which farrah fawcett plays marjorie attacked in her car by rapist joe james russo she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do she realizes however that joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives when her housemates pat alfre woodard and terry diana scarwid are off at work joe pays her a visit to finish what he started after joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him knowing full well she's in another his word against yours situation and that no rape technically took place she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to pat and terry what his intentions were br br the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents as it goes on marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis fawcett does a creditable enough job while russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation with only two characters on screen for much of the running time the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage director robert m young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times and by the time marjorie has the upper hand things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood and one hopes that pat can make her see reason br br extremities i felt was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity woodard and scarwid are both fine in support scarwid has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim and the pace is consistent granted the dialog isn't always very sharp but the material is compelling every step of the way br br 8 10
<START> well i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze why because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is it's unbelievably bad just to let you in on how bad it is i'll offer this little detail about the movie during scenes of mayhem which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies they intercut scenes from the video game yes you heard me right this movie really sucks in fact it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days and to see corn filled crap like this there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills i'm really disappointed with this knowing that i watched it ok i'm dumbstruck it's so bad i can't even find the words rating zero out of
<START> awful awful awful br br a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make once again i'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap br br i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good i wonder if she has seen this br br watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you
<START> i agree with the above comment i love the realism in this and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which i dislike because its not reality not meaning to say things can't get better and not meaning to say things don't in this movie but it doesn't spend most of the movie creating all these problems and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again when people have eating disorders people don't just admit it and want to get better and then life is peachy it takes time and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters we go through the difficulties with them getting better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and i loved that i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders it is scary to see how people react when they find out especially if they approve of it i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told and defiantly one of my favourites
<START> 666 the child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named donald boo boo stewart who is adopted by news reporter erika sarah lieving her cameraman husband scott lawson adam vincent after they covered the incident for channel 6 news at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after warnings from a nun vicar scott begins to believe that donald is evil the cause of all the deaths br br this straight to dvd horror flick was directed by jake perez under the pseudonym jake jackson one has to say 666 the child is really rather poor whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried i get very worried since their track record is awful they seem to specialise in making or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip offs of some recent successful big budget horror film in the case of 666 the child you don't need a degree in rocket science to realise that it's a complete rip off to cash in on the recent the omen 2006 which was released the same year the script by benjamin henry austin laurel is terrible simply can't match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent i mean just what exactly does donald the antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town it's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it every character in 666 the child is some form of the main character's from the omen the adopted parents the priest who tries to warn them the sinister babysitter there's a real lack of incident there's barely any gore the plot is poor i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random needless what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from there's just nothing that ties everything together it's just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly the references to the number 6 also becomes annoying are very unsubtle br br director perez does alright i suppose it's competent if nothing else there's virtually no blood or gore there's a few sprays of blood a cut off hand someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen it's certainly not scary there's no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house there's no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do there fore there's no threat from him br br technically the film is alright it's reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference the acting isn't that great but at the same time i've seen worse br br 666 the child is a poor mans the omen rip off i'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week not good definitely not recommended followed by the sequel 666 the beast 2007 which also went straight to dvd
<START> the one of the most remarkable sci fi movies of the millennium not only a movie but an incredible future vision this movie establishes a new standard of s f movies hail and kill
<START> i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess as any kid would be i was delighted with the imagination inventiveness and energy of the film several years later i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years in addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre this is korda the storyteller at his very best when you see thief as a child you know that you ve had a great time when you see thief as an adult you know that you ve seen a masterpiece it s as timeless as the story it treats an amazing work br br thomas mccarthy
<START> the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow's during world war ii it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor especially the lines expressed by the acid tongues leo genn anthony steele and david tomlinson later george banks in mary poppins are marvelous as the two heroes the direction is taut and fast moving throughout highly recommended
