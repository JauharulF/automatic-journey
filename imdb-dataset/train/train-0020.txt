<START> in cold blood has to be ranked as first rate movie making even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work based as it is on a true life crime spree br br it opens with quincy jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward kansas city effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end the b w photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start br br also clear from the start robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair hell no there are two kinds of rules in this world one for the rich and one for the poor says wilson taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel br br both are destined to cross the path of a farm family showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind br br blake reminiscing about movies and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico says remember bogart in 'treasure of the sierra madre' an ironic moment because blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets i got you pegged for a natural born killer wilson tells blake br br john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case discovering that all four family members were tied up shot in the head and one had his throat cut don't people around here lock doors asks paul stewart they will tonight is the terse reply br br after the murders the killers discover that there was no big fat safe in the wall like their prison informant told them so in the end it was truly a stupid senseless crime the question is why did they do it and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth it takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation br br it's these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they've made numerous mistakes and left a living witness the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end it makes no sense blake tells forsythe mr cutter was a very nice gentleman i thought so right up until the time i cut his throat the screenplay by richard brooks is concise and to the point and so is his direction br br summing up brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere 43 chilling
<START> first let me be honest i did not watch all this movie i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on it didn't this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become a decent horror movie because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made this film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung
<START> being the first feature film with robert de niro although not released for years later this is worth the watch de niro's role isn't huge yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today
<START> this film is a very good movie the way how the everybody portrayed their roles was great the story is nice it tells us about raj who is in love with priya they get married she later becomes pregnant but shortly their is a problem sadly they wont get the child raj later meets madhu he bribes her she later becomes pregnant but she is not married to him the movie is very good the dialogues are wonderful the songs are melodious to listen the picturisations are good the wedding song is very colourful salman rani preity were excellent the cinematography is excellent the film is beautifully pictured in swiztertland the cast makes the movie great to watch worth the money and time rating 8 10
<START> i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of h g wells' classic novel war of the worlds timothy hines has finally done it i just couldn't believe how good it was from the acting to the costuming the out of this world special effects i just can't say enough it was wonderful dramatic intense full of first rate performances by a top notch cast it's got to be seen to be believed i sure didn't and i've read all those negative comments by the others and can't believe what they were saying we must've been watching a different movie huh and those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy guy whoever he is well he just doesn't know what he's talking about br br keep up the good work mr hines
<START> back in 74 eric monte made the classic t v show good times jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on t v land jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie walker's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if jj would't have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended instead of 1974 1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when i was just growing up
<START> i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful how wrong am i br br it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it mira sorvino is so bad in the movie it is very painful to watch the scene with her she is a pretty girl but in this movie she is not seductive at all but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters it is so ridiculous br br and the dialog of the film is so pretentious and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable br br totally failure
<START> kenneth branagh's hamlet hits all the marks the acting is magnificent the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous the oscar nominated costumes and sets are stunning and patrick doyle's score also oscar nominated is sensitive and moving oh yeah the screenplay by some guy named will s isn't too bad either film critics ribbed branagh for receiving the films' fourth oscar nod for adapting the screenplay but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one i can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by br br nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly the use of england's blenheim palace for exteriors the edwardian dress and the staging of to be or not to be in a hall of mirrors to name a few the casting of hollywood luminaries such as robin williams billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting but that's nitpicking the principal cast excels derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius kate winslet acutely depicts ophelia's descent into madness julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of gertrude richard briers is pitch perfect as the conniving polonius and nicholas farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship every speech every line every word is delivered with passion and conviction there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film the final scenes magnify the extent of shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations br br branagh's hamlet is a bold ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery it's arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed Â strong praise but well deserved
<START> yes the first howling was a classic a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role maybe you could have gotten into an american werewolf in london hell that could have been possible it was set in london after all heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene in fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding
<START> the rumor is true girls like coyote ugly more than guys and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer and after initial frustration of having no luck overhears some girls partying about the 300 each they made last night she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise the place is completely full of two year old toddlers bursting at the sight of babes dancing br br the story is not bad and some characters are likeable especially cammie the fashion coordinator part was cute and the bouncer but let's face it the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie and check out violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer br br for the first time i could think of how could the production be so terrible for a brief moment with this movie hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying you were warned instead it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world advertising babes in a bar but showing a paper thin pursue your dream story disappointed every male teen you targeted br br and finally the music there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie especially when it was needed the hospital scene every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened but the climax was an ultimate laugher an '80s like song you would expect cyndi lauper to jump on the stage and jam with violet heck i personally thought bon jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too br br other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing especially the wet scene and a couple cute cliches coyote ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about whether you watched or made it it looked like nothing but time killing or wasting depending on how you look at it
<START> honestly if anyone has a brain there's not 1 positive thing br br to say about this movie what so ever br br i lost my 1 renting this i'd rather laugh at will smith saying if you got a dream you got to protect it br br all the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time even matthew mc conahay however you spell it was better then all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw 4 if you see this movie and have anything good to say you iq must be extremely low with such bad taste in movies it hurts thank you and the truth has been spoken br br save yourself from the misery br br get devil's rejects now that's a classic
<START> acclaimed japanese director takashi miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller an adaptation of yasushi akimoto's book concerning an evil old woman and child abuser who is part of a new urban legend if your cell phone rings with a strange tone and you see the message 'one missed call' you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of reality tv cameras intruding on the future victims but the not so elaborate deaths which include a hidden piece of red candy are disappointing and dispiriting the frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid hollywood predictably jumped on the far fetched plot in 2008 yet the u s version fared no better no stars from
<START> this movie is terrible terrible one of the worst movies ever i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this previews made us say no but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now we decided to go ahead and give it a shot br br stupid us br br affleck is not an actor he's an image and can look good with explosions but not even the kind bruce willis got in die hard if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys it would be a comedy br br the best part was catherine o'hara she's always good gandolfini flops again if it weren't for the sopranos he'd be washed up like he did in the mexican br br affleck hogs every scene and as others have said no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world her community is open among it's members but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals hmmmm this is starting to sound familiar lol it's not your typical movie very campy performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull kim novak is always a pleasure on screen but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual but not fatal to the story br br with re newed interest in all things witchy and dark this film deserves to be discovered and re discovered by old and new audiences it's still a hoot
<START> there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and it's drivel on satellite re runs now br br it might fool you because it has 2 moderately well known names in kistofferson and henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice monument valley scenery br br it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot br br if that's all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happy br br it's still drivel though
<START> of all movies and i'm a film graduate if that's worth anything to you this is the worst movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just haven't seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover talk about being young and retarded she's uncredited her role was unbelievably small how did she make it on the cover imdb doesn't even list it in her filmography this movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case it read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie
<START> i really enjoyed girl fight it something i could watch over and over again the acting was fantastic and i thought michelle rodriguez did a good job in the film very convincing might i say the movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life she had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time dealing with a ignorant dad didn't really help her much even though he loved her he was really hateful her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role the love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also i felt the passion the y had for one another then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream i thought it ended just right it was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them for all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i 'd suggest that you check this one out
<START> if you haven't seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don't waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i can't decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwin's hairstyle ellen pompeo's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break there's only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than ocean's 12 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one
<START> for movie fans who have never heard of the book shirley jackson's the haunting of hill house and have never seen the 1963 robert wise production with julie harris this remake will seem pretty darn bad br br for those of us who have it is just plain awful br br bad acting what was neeson thinking goofy computer enhancements and a further move away from jackson's story doom this remake br br do yourself a favor and rent the original movie it still effectively scares without hokey special effects the acting is professional and believable br br for readers of the book the from 1963 follows the it much closer
<START> i was overtaken by the emotion unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people the performances were faultless and outstanding
