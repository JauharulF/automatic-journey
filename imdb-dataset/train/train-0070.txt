<START> hobgoblins hobgoblins where do i begin br br this film gives manos the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made this one is fun to laugh at where as manos was just painful to watch hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term 80's cheeze the acting and i am using this term loosely is atrocious the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k and that version is the only way to watch this mess this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one liners they have ever done if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots god help you
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books he states you and i were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic nor do i think god had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe i hadn't seen a river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book a must read i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god's creations a combination of macleans story and my desire to move back to the northwest has driven me to move to montana i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go fly fishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside a place where you seldom worry about crime i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their mercedez bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentions br br anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones there is a lot of deep thinking in this film the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life it takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning if you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera angles movement etc then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks the fast and the furious is the greatest film granted it was entertaining but shallow br br the bottom line this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together quality not qauntity
<START> this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and three's company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers oh well just my thoughts
<START> i just watched this for the first time in a long time i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are with the scene at the candlelight club in waterloo bridge among the most romantic ever filmed br br anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunter niven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld br br my favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time but this one is superb br br
<START> there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned one either likes it very much applauding its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else loathes its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and play concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime a crushing bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only intermittently that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say as in rhine i still can't stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy's long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days i urge a peek at watch on the rhine as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago
<START> this early film has its flaws a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images it's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically note for examples the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery br br its core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing even though you know that the hero has to win it becomes quite believable that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his motivating the final plot pay off is very well entwined with the progress of the match the inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should you can almost hear the ticking even though this is a silent film the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it br br the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of laserlight a public domain company as with each hitchcock silent they've released they've attached various musical selections mostly orchestral to the action the sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality varies widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here br br this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films
<START> first of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic gregory's girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated while it's true that sequels are usually bar a few notable exceptions a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense in the case of gregory's two girls bill forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins on the one hand revisiting the plot of gregory's girl while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers schoolboy gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy although now thirty five gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances also sixteen despite the fact that music teacher bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend there's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who actively and comically pursues dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over at thirty five gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished save two pointless scenes with his younger sister who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants who he is and why he is the way he is why for example is he friendless why does he never see his father who is clearly still alive why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended why is he so interested in noam chomsky and injustice why has he become so apathetic why is he attracted to frances why isn't he attracted to bel until the last twenty minutes of the film what in heaven's name do bel or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school kids does gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything to make matters worse actor john gordon sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy on top of that it's hard to feel any sympathy for or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia it's hard to know what was going through bill forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all that at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent as it is gregory's two girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less gregory's girl was responsible for launching bill forsyth's career here's hoping that gregory's two girls won't be responsible for sinking it
<START> like many americans i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw spirited away i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki one of his earlier works is castle in the sky although it's still enjoyable it's not as good as spirited away though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair br br a young boy named pazu james van der beek is working in a mine late one night when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky when she wakes up the next morning she introduces herself as sheeta anna paquin but sheeta has a secret and before he knows it pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates the army and a lost floating city br br going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing a sense of wonder and magic many filmmakers have tried but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood br br because the film is animated dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words it also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors the voice acting is varied james van der beek fares best he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta she's frightened by the events going on around her but she knows what she has to do mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska he's dangerous and wants something from sheeta and will do anything to get it the other voices are bad cloris leachman is awful as dola leachman may have won an oscar for the last picture show but she's annoying as the pirate leader leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous it's so bad it nearly ruins the film jim cummings is an effective voice over actor but he's miscast as the general br br i would definitely recommend seeing castle in the sky i'll probably end up buying it myself but even though it's not as good as spirited away it's still pretty good
<START> wow what a snoozer definately one of bacon's worst films the bad acting coupled with a formulatic if not incredulous script make me yearn for time i wasted on viewing this on cable television back not really much i can say about it a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by spoiler a basketball game grade f
<START> there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen br br zorro's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off it's a republic serial in 12 chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman like actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon br br another big difference is that the setting isn't california the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop br br don't get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro one br br the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and there's lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial
<START> i watched 'ice age'in the movie theater and i liked the movie spite of the fact that 'ice age'has many flaws and scientific errors like humans sabers dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period and even the location of where the story passes looks north america but has some characteristics from iceland for example we can have fun even so unless you are very severe br br the planet is entering an ice age and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer sid is a stupid sloth that is left behind by his own family that can't stand him any longer walking in his way he meets manfred or how he calls '' manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north worried that he can easily be captured sid decides to follow manfred and in the middle of their journey they found a human mother with her baby the mother dies but manfred and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans diego one of the sabers decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp what manfred and sid does not know is that diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food what will happen will depend of diego's behavior and conscience br br aka a era do gelo brazil
<START> i was the production accountant on this movie and i also got to do some voice over work on it so i'm not entirely unbiased but if it were awful i would say so i thought it was a fun film not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way the bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your health br br so many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film susan sarandon of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame melanie mayron was seen on tv on a weekly basis as a photographer in the thirty something tv drama series robert englund later became known as freddie krueger still haunting people's dreams one of my personal favorite actors on this show was dub taylor who played the sheriff he was an excellent comedic actor and a truly nice sincere person we all had fun working on this show and i think that fun comes through
<START> ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie its about this pampered rat who lives in a palace then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats he plans to take the gem and to flood rat city the cool part about this movie is the slugs they do all the sound effects they sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny ok bottom line it is aimed at 7 year olds other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see i didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though more like wallace and gromit i thinkthey slacked a little on that the movie was just decent not worth spending 9 50 for though sorry
<START> the true story of the friendship that shook south africa and awakened the world br br richard attenborough who directed a bridge too far and gandhi wanted to bring the story of steve biko to life and the journey and trouble that journalist donald woods went through in order to get his story told the films uses wood's two books for it's information and basis biko and asking for trouble br br the film takes place in the late 1970's in south africa south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race the blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army we are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants then we are introduced to donald woods kevin kline who is the editor of a popular newspaper after publishing a negative story about black activist steve biko denzel washington woods goes to meet with him the two are wary of each other at first but they soon become good friends and biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to woods this encourages woods to speak out against what's happening around him and makes him desperate to bring steve biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's south africa and to the world soon steve biko is arrested and is killed in prison now woods and his family are daring to escape from south africa to england where woods can publish his book about steve biko and the apartheid br br when i first heard of cry freedom i was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of steve biko i had never actually heard of steve biko before i seen this film as the events in this film were really before my time but it's more about the story of donald woods and his journey across the border into lesotho as he tried to elude the south african officials woods was put on a five year type house arrest after steve biko was killed so in order to publish his manuscript on steve biko he had to escape because the manuscript would be considered treason in south africa and that could have resulted in woods meeting a fate similar to that of biko's the real donald woods and his wife acted as consultants to this film br br denzel washington is only in the film for the first hour and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie but he was amazing as steve biko and captured his personality from what i've read really well and his accent sounded perfect his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor kevin kline delivers a excellent and thought evoking performance as donald woods and penelope wilton is excellent as his wife wendy br br filming took place in zimbabwe as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in south africa while in south africa the south african gestapo followed the film crew everywhere so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring zimbabwe instead despite everything and the fact that the apartheid didn't end 'til seven years later cry freedom wasn't banned in south africa but cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats br br richard attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination he doesn't hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown turns into a massacre when police open fire on them the film ends with the names of all the anti apartheid movers who died in prison and the explanations for their deaths many had no explanation quite a few were epilepsy which is hard to believe and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were suicide from hanging no one will ever know what really happened to them but i think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands but at the hands of others or to be more precise at the hands of the police br br cry freedom is a must see movie for it's portrayal and story of steve biko it's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence
<START> ever notice how in his later movies burt reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes br br must have been hanging out with hal needham too much br br and from the looks of stroker ace way too much br br can you believe this was based on a book neither could i but it was and probably not a best seller i'll wager br br burt's another good old boy in the nascar circuit who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team anderson provides what love interest there is and nabors does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic best friend lugs br br a lot of people here are friends of burt's or hal's others must have needed the work and even real nascar drivers get in on the act and look to have more talent than those with sag cards br br as far as laughs go bubba smith pre police academy gets them as beatty's chauffeur and petersen in full elvira mode gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know lugs real well real well br br it's a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like stroker ace where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not they didn't bother to write a character for him why bother to act br br two stars mostly for petersen and for the out takes at the end now they're funny
<START> i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it i wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama it had elements of both mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful our image of 60 year old women has certainly changed since aunt bee they are vibrant beautiful sexy the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the mtm or rhoda shows from the 1970's i'd have thought that since it was set in new york city where rhoda had been set that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared assuming of course she was still in the big apple br br it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows by the way what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion or an eventual series wasn't that the network that carried the mtm and rhoda shows
<START> how can a movie that features the singing of curtis mayfield be bad it can't the groove tube is a series of scatological black out sketches that makes fun of anything from 2001 to the olympics the highs koko the clown the easy lube recipe outnumber the lows an all too long the dealers but even the lows are funny best of all is ken shapiro's manic dance down a busy manhattan sidewalk that is shapiro not nat king cole singing just you just me definitely dated now but at the time the groove tube was irreverent bold shameless and hysterically funny ken shapiro made this minor cult hit then 7 years later made the christmas day opening bomb modern problems though i enjoyed it and since then unfortunately nothing he could possibly be playing drums in a jazz group the groove tube remains to me an unending burst of positive energy a movie that 26 years after my initial viewing still brings me real joy
<START> love this film also saw it when it was first shown i8n germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie br br it doesn't exist much copies of that film mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of therapist br br for the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible
<START> as much as i like japanese movies this one didn't just cut it a movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot br br the photography is ok though i've seen much better sword fight scenes in other japanese movies the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince me at all the soundtrack is so weak you don't even notice its presence but worst of all was the way the plot evolved i have to admit that at some times i had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a hollywood influence br br all in all if your looking for an action japanese movie this isn't it its very slow with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental in a bad way
