<START> i'll just put it out here that was the worst sequel to a classic disney film i've ever seen in 1950 disney released what i hail as one of his greatest films of all time now take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost tv show put it together and what do you get the biggest load of crud i've ever seen after i saw this i thought it was all over for disney cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after not this garbage this film did not deserve a sequel like this i thought it would be like a twist in time which was moderate but better than this also what do we care of anastasia she switched sides like iago did but it didn't help anyone
<START> french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary everyday suburban life this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps time out a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job as is the penchant of french filmmakers many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema verite feel to the story yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage most notably a swiss mountain retreat running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production jacques audiard's gritty crime caper sur mes levres read my lips actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that as with the earlier french release it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them in a paris construction firm carla a shy diminutive young woman sits at her desk sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms br br obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla's desk to chat and drop off their half finished styrofoam cups of coffee partially deaf carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant preferably male as if she were at a personals agency he should be 25 years old and clean cut with extensive computer and filing skills when the agency sends over an unkempt menacing looking young man carla is both shocked and intrigued they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery where carla interviews her prospective assistant when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on although she is basically kind toward her helper carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips later when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on a furious carla asks paul's help in seeking revenge on the man from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where carla's lip reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars there is a teasing on again off again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars that being said what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city in this case paris where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared it's hitchcock with the gloves off
<START> a charming funny film that gets a solid grade all around i saw a screener of this film recently at work it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day so much so that i figured i'd write in not sure if this film is going to theaters but i hope it does its a nice film to see with friends its a charmer and has some funny jokes the acting was terrific especially howard hessman and larry dorf the directing was pretty good not a film that needed to be over directed what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing it was like neil simon seinfeldish and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm as an aspiring screenwriter i notice those things i'm a dork anyway a really cute film that i recommend
<START> wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one outside of the uniform positive reviews i've read turns out i could have never imagined this movie because it's very close to the bride with white hair in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic this walks a fine line between being a farce a comedy and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling there's nothing scary about it that's not the theme it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost this also takes place in ancient china with wild outlandish kung fu exhibitions and a trip to hell more or less some of the stop action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are top rate all the way i could watch this genre of chinese movies all day because they are highly entertaining great visuals and pretty much tongue in cheek and i'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also highly recommended
<START> i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's tom bighouseaz yahoo com the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement br br i have seen zatoichi 1 13 15 16 i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 usa zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing the story line was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines at one point i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film br br this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects a head rolling limbs severed blood and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action and won a great following without having to resort to effects br br i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend this is the first zatoichi film from his studio i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films and recommend them
<START> this was without a doubt the best of the dirty harry series from the opening credits you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge eastwood has many aside sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but show harry at his bad assed best loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective action flicks this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any fluff i can watch this again and again okay not in one sitting because it's a gratifying out for revenge yarn the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable go ahead make my day you feel lucky punk classic eastwood as only eastwood with his anguished rubbery expressions and whispery menacing voice can do it
<START> i tried twice to get through this film succeeding the first time and it was like pulling teeth and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer the problem it's simply too boring br br if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene which takes up most of the second half of the film you have it made but it's tough getting to that point there are some interesting talks by abraham lincoln henry fonda during the trial the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen br br it's a nice story well acted and such but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film
<START> this is one of those movies in which people keep saying that's a great idea about the worst ideas you've ever heard then they act on them i like it this picture's funnier than any 3 dozen seth rogen projects well so is shoah br br gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin stories since the 60s but this one goes further what can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck this travesty presents a ww2 suicide brigade on the last of the marshall islands presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the us marines away then the japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard they retreat to the mainland where one of them becomes a business tycoon br br then it gets complicated br br blonde men from the future irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating godzilla before he destroys japan the help is questionable as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed circuit tv but hey they shot the script you would think that by the 90s the japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships fortunately for nippon the white guys you can tell they're american because they say nucyaler erred by bringing back in time the one japanese girl left in the future in a touching display of ancestor worship she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a sailor moon backpack turns out these time traveling fashion disabled caucasians are just jealous of japan's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world in the 22d century japan's going to buy africa which sounds more like a liability than an asset these blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace godzilla with king ghidorah who will destroy all of japan except tokyo a strange choice but toho's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that tokyo skyline set again br br sure enough we are given the alternate spectacle of fukuoka my garden city and some other heretofore unscathed by rubber monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1 3 of a hydra in a surprise revelation we are informed that king ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down wait didn't the spaceship blondes already destroy godzilla yeah they killed him in the third reel but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles ha ha don't worry we don't keep it in japanese waters with which to jumpstart a new godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur only they don't have to because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made godzilla whole again oh and godzilla finally gets to tokyo reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition they look into each other's eyes and godzilla nods as if to say gotta do it man the tycoon nods in understanding then godzilla blows him up br br i should also mention here that in order to prevent godzilla's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying japan the japanese girl from the future goes back to the future to ask for help from yes a balding white man probably because he pities her as the sole asian character from the 23d century he agrees to build a mecha ghidora and send it back to the 1990s so that together these two giant monsters can uh fulfill godzilla's destiny and destroy japan in a wonderful nod to those notoriously self willed whipping heads the girl piloting mecha ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick br br this godzilla suit design owes much to the sumo his thighs are flabby enough to double for rush limbaugh's and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous but there's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures which makes up for a lot also features a man with a passing resemblance to robert patrick playing a killer robot yes in the future even the robots will have bald spots plus megumi odaka reprising her role as micki the only japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that it's not her fault many japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face i did some acting for japanese television and i can tell you they push you to go for it they apparently urge their writers in the same way thank god
<START> the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer director star or is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a movie tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy
<START> i was going to give it an 8 but since you people made 6 5 out of a lot better votes i had to up my contribution the river styx was pure genius sure woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the dialog was clever enough and woody's card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be and a plus a little sorcerer's apprentice to go along with it and of course did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy charles dance is always entertaining as was hugh jackman
<START> i will admit i thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but i soon changed my mind the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help greg kinnear is an awesome straight man as his role as a mild mannered man from denver who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners mostly about sex br br the imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the bullfight scene when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
<START> the boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear the voice of an angel that would be miss van doren auditioning and going under the name of miss andrews because her father doesn't approve of her being a radio singer however she hopes a certain big wig mrs bixby a friend of her dad's will hire her and then he will have to give his approval br br she leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out to kill them after they ruin the recording session finally things calm down whew we eluded them says moe yeah we got away too answers curly br br the boys then fool around in the studio put on miss van doren's record and curly gets dressed in women's clothes and pretends he's singing mrs bixby walks in is impressed and hires seniorita cucacha on the spot for an extra 500 she's asked to come and sing at their high society party that night the rest as they say is history as curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results oh by the way he accompanied by senior mucho and senior gusto br br what happens at the party is simply that the truth wins out but not before a few slapstick antics take place in all a pretty good episode i enjoyed it but wouldn't rate it as anything special
<START> since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequel br br the little mermaid one is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a child's self perspective the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the ending feels like recess br br the little mermaid 2 starts out when baby melody is presented to ariel's side of the family abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama a giant tentacle grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute it's not funny the baby's being attacked okay i'll stop laughing morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly br br throughout the feature melody seems superhuman which i defend is how most children envision themselves this quality in melody's character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face br br like the first movie melody has a lot of ariel's problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parent br br the music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much orchestral work went into it it's great for little ones because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them br br the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water it's definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking it's time for recess ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun
<START> prom night 2008 br br directed by nelson mccormick br br starring brittany snow scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis br br plot three years ago donna brittany snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher jonathan schaech who has a bit of a crush on her now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends once there they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt br br pros i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves br br an example br br everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she doesn't seem that great has escaped from prison their reason they don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends lol br br cons let me start off by saying i'm a huge slasher fan usually i can have fun with even the bad ones i even like some pg 13 horror films tourist trap 1979 one of my favorites was originally rated pg i also enjoy poltergeist 1982 and the grudge 2004 so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg 13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie br br first of all i had a big problem with the story i like slasher films that don't even have stories at least they can be entertaining this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student so he kills her entire family a few years later he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about claire jessica stroup is fighting with her boyfriend she has cramps and i couldn't care less this should have been a lifetime feature not a remake of prom night br br and then this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes i don't even care that it's not that gory some of my favorite slashers halloween curtains the original prom night were not that gory but they still had effective murders here we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony i'm sure that 10 year old girls were terrified but not me br br i also hated the characters there was donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby scott porter and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life unless you are a gay male then we had donna's annoying friends claire stroup and lisa dana davis and the token mean girl chrissy brianne davis if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying try watching this movie and don't get me started on ronnie collins pennie and the dj jay phillips who gave me flashbacks to usher's performance in she's all that br br add to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker
<START> three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt jane stanton hitchcock's novel for the tube yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit struggling artist meg tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy enigmatic ellen burstyn who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom after learning about the last gathering held there ellen's daughter's coming out party tilly decides on her artistic theme never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close scrutiny one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity burstyn's role teeters on camp while tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy eyed waif routine only one sequence late in the film the morning after the mural is finished is charged with honest feeling anger and betrayal the rest is piffle
<START> if i were to create a movie thermometer this movie would be absolute zero out of ten stars i would rate it as follows br br plot zero stars video quality zero stars sound quality zero stars acting zero stars br br it is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera made up a plot and shot a movie it is so lacking in any artistic value that i'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie br br however something is to be said for the abysymal depths the shootout in the staircase is one of the most train wreck funny scenes ever first of all the combatants simply wave plastic guns at each other jerking their arms back and forth to simulate recoil the pair actually duck each other's non existent bullets no squibs no sparks no blanks just waving spraypainted squirtguns around if you want to see two grown men play actor give it a spin someday after you have cleaned the fridge combed the carpet polished all of the doorknobs raked the gravel straightened the books on the shelf etc
<START> here is an innovative television drama which so easily blends a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to it's own tune whether it's audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula prison break 24 and desperate housewives come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television this is how it's so defiant of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the naysayers lost is has been and always will be there to appease it's cult following first and the general public next but it's a testament to it's inventiveness that it's garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences
<START> this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe the original bucked the trend of big budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat grinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphy's zany behavior this film would be a flop
<START> the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family low income working class dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown's witty arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movie lovers
<START> this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think that's always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and i wasn't expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i don't expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen king's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies i'm sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong
