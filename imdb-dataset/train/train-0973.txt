<START> this so called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of dangerous liasons the plots are identical as is most of the script i loved the book its based off of and i loved the first movie but i'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie the pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal and i just can't stress how bad the movie was if you don't want to take my word for it just watch it and you'll see what i mean if you've read a review that says that 'if you likes the first one you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because it is the exact same movie although the plot is not even as good they took so many lines from the first movie its hard to tell which movie you're watching
<START> this movie is one of the funniest saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the balkans yet again 45 years after the time depicted all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types however make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex yugoslavia to its madness in fact no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie and its twin maratonci trce pocasni krug did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen
<START> this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie and quite true to my own experience of bulimia it was actually well researched and i can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details the characters were quite well drawn and the performances by mare winningham and alison lohman were great i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for beth's bulimia it wasn't some diet gone out of control caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media pressures we're not actually going to address her mother wasn't completely clueless too often on television they'll take an issue that everyone has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't diabetes what's that oh my world is all askew doctor please explain it all to me as if i'm a small child etc it was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs and the scenes where beth was throwing up weren't overly melodramatic and sensationalist and concentrated more on bulimics' need for secrecy and their out of controlness the scene where beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room br br okay so i liked those bits what didn't work for me so well was the ending which headed back to the tv movie territory we know and don't particularly love but i guess they had to wrap it up you too can cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in america br br and can i just say again that i really like mare winningham she's great
<START> i am and was very entertained by the movie it was my all time favorite movie of 1976 being raised in the 70's i was so in love with kris kristoffersons look and demeanor of course i am no movie critic but for the time era i think it was very good i very much like the combo of streisand and kristofferson i thought they worked very well together i have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as esther and john norman i am a very huge fan of kris and see him in concert when i can what a talented singer song writer not to mention actor i have seen him in many movies but still think back to a star is born
<START> the intruder l'intrus a film directed by french director clair denis is the liberation of film it follows its own spirit across time space and character there may be a plot but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd sleeve honestly it's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations the film demands that the viewer think but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding br br the human heart is the film's enigma every image questions its role its nature and its form the heart is the intruder that of the viewer and that of louis louis' character is played by michel subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character honestly anyone could've played louis' character if he or she possessed a wandering willing and comfortable heart yet subor is the one featured here he becomes the film his identity is inseparable from it many of the film's images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions vocal but mainly physical br br the intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take surrealistic has been a term used in describing this film but perhaps quasirealistic is a more adequate term nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light br br watch the trailer a few times if you're attracted to visual imagery see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom
<START> as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up even the grim ripper made us smile those two alien things made me laugh bill and ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie this is a lot better than the first one and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something something big something important made a better house and girlfriends no i'd say better villains use clones instead of robots i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks br br the grim ripper don't be scared he's not the deathy kind is funny when he fell from the sky i split a gut splat i'm not sure about those aliens what where they scientists no way
<START> this animated movie is a masterpiece the narration music animation and storyline where all remarkable my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot when i asked them to come along to see it they thought it was a movie about horses but afterwards they realized it was more than that i liked esperanza spirit rain and lil' creek who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that i found to be empowering and inspirational br br i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again i enjoyed spirit tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic dignified and non stereotypical unlike the movie the road to el dorado which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way but dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit and i would like to see sequels or spinoffs to spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping american indians br br i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit stallion of the cimarron
<START> ahh talespin what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most well written shows i've ever encountered live action or animation the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for but not talespin br br the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones br br the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren't specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons in the episode stormy weather for instance kit cloudkicker decides that he's going to join an air circus but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan to which kit screams no you can't tell me what to do your're not my dad and buries his face in his pillow the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays br br the characters have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you can't let that deceive you she can be a real hellion sometimes kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a pirate br br in the end it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in all's whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit's word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults baloo and becky's relationship is also realistic due to baloo's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol' sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he'd still do jobs for rebecca br br the sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the plane's functions don't change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super planes of other cartoons it doesn't have one single weapon on board unless you count mangoes and relies instead on it's cunning pilot's great skill to get out of trouble it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus it's just such a darn cool design br br this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars
<START> if you like to be entertained do not go see this movie if you like to see heroics of war do not go see this movie if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay do not go see this movie if you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war go see this movie otherwise don't waste your time i am always interested in war movies because i think that if they are done well they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war this film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside saying whorrible cliche lines doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed this film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the united states of america can you imagine being a person from europe or africa or any other country and watching this being told that this is how americans truly are no wonder everyone hates us please please please don't waste your time on this piece of junk if you must wait and rent it 4 10
<START> unfortunately this film has long been unavailable as other posters have noted but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty town it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers and it's a surpassing example of how the director frank borzage was able to create an almost fairy tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social inequity which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were this film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need and it is totally life affirming this is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known
<START> ettore scola one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have is not yet available on dvd it's summer 2001 right now mysteries to goggle the mind br br this grand classic returned to the theaters in my home town thanks to a sophia loren summer retrospective and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video tape it is a true gift br br to avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film he never saw the film before and doesn't like those italian oldies like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder even during the end titles the theater remained completely silent br br this special day is truly special a wonder of refinement and a big loss if you haven't seen it yet

<START> let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many far fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life this is combined with popular tv show csi style flash forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the arguments clues are far fetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it bottom line it's a pretentious fantasy csi documentary not worth watching

<START> witchcraft witchery la casa 4 and whatever else you wish to call it how about crud br br a gathering of people at a massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel torturous methods photographer gary david hasselhoff is taking pictures for linda catherine hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble ee yor of the winnie the poo cartoon a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without permission rose brooks annie ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and along with husband freddie robert champagne who is always ogling other women much younger than him pregnant daughter jane linda blair and grandson tommy michael manchester who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch sesame street instead of starring in this rubbish go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by realtor tony giordano's son jerry rick farnsworth obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet along with these folks is architect leslie leslie cumming whose character is a nympho who might help rose re design the resort the boat's captain is killed by the lady in black hildegard knef wearing her make up and lip stick extra thick and a storm is brewing the boat drives off by itself guided by the invisible power of the lady in black i guess with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort which is in dire need of repairs most of the victims before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension perhaps a type of hell or something where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage one victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney roasted as the others light the fireplace one poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck one fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge and bleed and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in hasselhoff's face one fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice one is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering the film despite it's excesses is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of hasselhoff and blair who deserve better than this almost unbearable at times building little to no suspense clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer we do get a chance to see pregnant women who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs jumping out three story windows oh and the lady in black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see tommy has a little sesame street recorder which tapes the lady in black's mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later for some reason the lady in black likes to visit little tommy he's not at all scared of her for tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear need i say more this one's a real stinker ugh
<START> make no bones about it there are a lot of things wrong with this movie it's clichÃ©d the whole way not very funny predictable and illogical let's start at the beginning characters there's the boring luckless guy giving stiller another notch in his boring luckless guy belt the allegedly wild but in reality just fairly normal love interest whom aniston plays well but really needed no effort to do so the fat jovial friend and then the assortment of clichÃ©s an annoying daredevil australian guy a confident spanish guy etc the storyline the beginning is slightly unusual but thereafter goes into the standard any movie style with every plot turn as predictable as your average knock knock joke the biggest problem was that stiller's character's development really seemed to come from nothing like your average school play the writers knew where he started and where he ended but didn't put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit finally the alleged 'jokes' were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard gross out humour there was a regulation chunder scene sweaty fat men etc br br in conclusion the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing hamburg really dished up a dog's dinner here and the sugar coating of stiller and aniston may have lured the viewers but the taste left at the end was just as rancid br br final comment this film may have been dreadful but aniston still picked a better between friends seasons movie than kudrow's odious 'marci x '
<START> this is a refreshing enjoyable movie if you enjoyed four weddings and a funeral peter's friends etc you will see a number of familiar and talented actors made me laugh made me sad i view movies for entertainment and english set movies generally fit that bill for me enjoy
<START> if you've ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer what's the question then perhaps you should thank god if you've never met a lacanian slavoj zizek the most evangelical of lacanians would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacan hegel br br zizek's star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselves br br the ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego superego and id god knows what happened to zeppo or gummo Â perhaps they're the sinthome or is that movies themselves this is simply what they are in zizek's output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god's will br br what's wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek lacan is the answer Â so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance zizek's exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a voyeur's fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek's two hour and a half cinematic sermon br br his analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue velvet is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance zizek says that isabella rossilini's character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation this is an example of her jouissance well possibly but sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this in the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan but this may be due to any number of things isn't that the point of so called feminine jouissance according to lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is non sensical and entirely mystical it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek there's feminine jouissance for you why is this feminine jouissance because i say so br br what example can really be garnered from these films only zizek's psychology why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on botega bay he says he wants to f rod steiger too is this not the wish fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films as the saying goes freud would have a field day with the pervert's guide to the cinema but with zizek himself nobody else br br zizek's theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire for as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised if at all zizek's love of making everything an example of lacan's answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in zizek's desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don't like letting the subject speak for itself br br the pervert's guide to the cinema is a summation zizek's love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isn't zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into question br br zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing he's a kind of henry ford of cultural theory mass production and any colour as long as it's black he is perfect for today's highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same c ap over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me zizek's third matrix pill is a suicide capsule br br ps i loved zizek's solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect people's sympathies did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws
<START> kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is scatter shot its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still don't know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together i'd take a pass
