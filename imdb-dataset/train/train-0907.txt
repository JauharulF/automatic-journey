<START> i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love it's not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime everything's pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess i'm not the target audience for this but i'm not sure who is everything's muted and soft focus and earth tones nothing's very interesting i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it's handled so discreetly that i was disappointed rent personal best instead
<START> the night listener 2006 1 2 robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance br br what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm br br in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate br br written by armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core br br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for
<START> a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films the trail leads the mother all over europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep br br this is one of the countless soft core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill personally i'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of s m to the proceedings the violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement its all so incredibly fake worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting basically par for the course for many of these films br br you'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur but there was nothing the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a buick i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller br br avoid
<START> i was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when i checked it on imdb after seeing it this really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies it looks like a good movie in the beginning but when he comes into surgery i couldn't believe how bad it got this voice over destroys everything just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says i saw the movie in german so i don't really know what he said in english but ironic stuff like yeah right it doesn't hurt what is this telling yourself think about something else and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just stupid and his mother how the hell does she figure something like that out someone comes to tell her her son died in surgery what she kind of had to expect plus she found some letters in jessica albas bag plus that she knows the hospital stuff and then it takes her one second to figure it out what the hell and the ending why does the police bust them the patient died in surgery thats all that happened that drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either and then they bust them all even the girlfriend why despite all that i think christensen did a bad job but that doesn't really count for me those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem i watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed as i said one of the worst movies i have ever seen just don't watch it
<START> this is not one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i have ever scene the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries but without the sex the only reason i bought this was i wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one i could find possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever the soundtrack is really tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed i would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students do not buy this movie the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights utter utter utter uttter unbelievable garbage 0 10 if only the voting system would allow that
<START> about a year ago i finally gave up on american television i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office extras blackadder and the league of gentlemen it was then that i decided to switch to british television among all the shows listed above the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet characters included are the most unhappily married couple a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid probably for the best a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people and the worst veterinarian ever this program is one of the best i've seen
<START> comedy central has had success with original programming using professional comics the chapelle show mind of mencia the daily show and the hugely popular colbert report all star professional comics and all are or in the case of chapelle show were solid shows given that sarah silverman is one of the best female comics in the business i was expecting good stuff when i tuned in br br i was so disappointed br br there were some mildly funny sequences but given that the star is the caliber of silverman the show could have been much better it was just the pilot and hopefully next week's show will be better if not get her some help in the form of better writers for the show
<START> i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family
<START> you know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives it all goes downhill from there unnecessary matrix influenced bullet time camera work pointless cuts to video game footage crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye even the zombies are boring br br i was hoping for at least a so bad it's good zombie movie but this one is so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again br br
<START> this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still i'm generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed i'm in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do like br br i got home and popped it in my patience lasted 15 minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture br br after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani 1 65m 5'5 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i haven't finished it yet so i wasn't positive br br after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back yes it took me 5 5 years so dani in fact was funny as satan manson super evil man's helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess he's just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it br br we have a couple of short stories joined by dani's character my favourite was about a guy who steals someone's leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly br br the acting's rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stinger's cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is let's just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his size br br you might think after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good but it's just bad cradle of filth fans can add 3 points i added one for gore
<START> when i ordered this from blockbuster's website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe i'd forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late 70's style wide collars bell bottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster br br the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and porno quality music on the would be viewer from the opening scene with the poorly done effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues' br br throughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barker's impacted bowels but it had menacing pencil thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two with some assistance br br moving on as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue we found out that they're caught in a space time warp how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less off the cuff fashion like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice cold bottle of refreshing coca cola was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein's theories br br the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad there's not enough 'really's' to describe it really br br i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion bury this one quick
<START> i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway i love the broadway musical and i love the movie i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so i developed a philosophy really early assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it is br br i danced for 12 years before i had to make a choice i was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but i wasn't super talented i was however super talented as a show rider i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that i had to make a choice when i turned 14 that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week and dedicate to one or the other so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies i just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it i love the movie i love the broadway musical
<START> well here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film making the rudimentary premise of what's the matter with helen is quite shocking and disturbing but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hushÂhushÂsweet charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but there's a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique we're literally catapulted back to the 1930's with a sublime depiction of that era's music religion theatrical business and wardrobes following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winters flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies the script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced there's never a dull moment in what's the matter with helen although the singing tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters she's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees' and michael myers' combined there are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like michÃ©al macliammÃ³ir as the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies' house there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an oscar are breathtaking
<START> this bomb is just one 'explosion' after another with no humor and only absurd situations really pyrotechnics to the extreme reality is not one of its strong points i give it a 1 out of 10 i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted sorry but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles but then at times we all need to have money and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey but if that was a turkey this movie then is not even a gizzard i wish i could say give me back my money you can bet i would if i could but that is the trouble with premium services the subscription variety
<START> everyone should totally see this movie it's freaking scary but doesn't resort to lame jump out at you just to surprise you and pass it off as scary things it really is great see this freaking awesome movie the director is stanley kubrick easily the greatest director who ever lived every single one of his movies are masterpieces including this one the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the colorado rockies as caretakers for the winters and get snowed in well the house is haunted the kid is psychic the husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels and well hilarity ensues not really it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions and it gets scary not just the classic here's johnny scene it's memorable but can't speak for the whole movies it's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately and you just gotta see it so go on netflix and get it geeeeeetttttttt itttttttt
<START> well then thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie i was about 5 when the original movie came out and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing so now that i'm 16 and feeling masochistic enough i decided to rent this movie thus i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it right down to the last detail br br in this movie ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter melody and go to show her to everyone in the ocean broadway style after the musical number ends within minutes the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton doesn't give up the trident thus he gives it up without even a fight eric stands there gaping though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody morgana escapes so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caught br br well uh nothing of note really happens eric is a total wuss he never really manages to do anything ariel sort of does something melody manages to screw things up plus the animation is a new low point for disney the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds ever single opportunity for character development is wasted the songs bite br br look don't waste your time i'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens they won't want to sing the songs if you manage to grab a copy of this throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it ever
<START> i would have liked to write about the story but there wasn't any i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like 5 minutes after that its overkill i would have liked to swoon over the 'keep u guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as um mm a yash raj movie i would have liked to talk of the edge of the seat action but i don't like cartoons much br br sigh br br all in all this movie is perfect for 1 people attempting suicide i promise it'll push you over the edge 2 sado masochists this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da vinci code wore 3 people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 movie piraters more power to them if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch this is it 5 barnacles most types of plankton green algae because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers afterthought the director of the movie obviously is a species of his own and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind one is enough br br things that could have made this a better movie 1 a story 2 a choreographer 3 a screenplay writer 4 a stunt coordinator 5 a story did i already say that 6 a director preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job 7 anil kapoor bubonic plague avoid at all costs 8 a statutory warning watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health br br things i liked about the movie 1 kareena kapoor for obvious reasons 2 the english sub titles mera dil kho gaya becomes my heart is in a void chaliya chaliya chaliya turns into im a flirt im a lover im a vagabond priceless br br in short tashan to me is like the opposite of a rubrics cube the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player tashan promises to lower your iq and that in a mere 2 5 hours woot br br sigh but thats just me i could be wrong you've been warned anyways
<START> this is a very beautiful and almost meditative film there is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of children's films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children
<START> i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are br br those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
<START> i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse funnier and funnier better if you're a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or movie making skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast forward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv
