<START> i saw this recently on a cable channel the movie is great it's one of the few musicals i have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on i didn't know where to look next one day i shall go and see this on the big screen just so that i see what's happening but what really lifts this to another level is oliver reed's performance as bill sykes not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else some inner demons he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner he was capable of anything it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness just awaiting the trigger i have seen the robert newton's bill sykes from the 1948 movie and i thought he was 'just' a bad egg but oliver reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room
<START> with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10
<START> the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships first and foremost an adult son and his father but also that son with his wife his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semi autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny poignant and thought provoking it led me to re evaluate my own relationship with both my now deceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as paul's father the role could not have been better cast i hope that both mr falk and mr reiser are recognized in next year's movie awards for their efforts falk for his performance and reiser for his script
<START> worst movie with the best reviews given it i've ever seen over the top dialog acting and direction more slasher flick than thriller with all the great reviews this movie got i'm appalled that it turned out so silly shame on you martin scorsese
<START> i saw brother's shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait
<START> when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet as far as the main storyline goes they are very similar an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar's sophomore effort sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of toy story nor is the animation out of this world however the story is top notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot i could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics br br there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here between our lead flick needing to keep his self esteem up to save his colony the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons he is not doing it to be mean but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth it is very much a circle of life but not one that can't evolve with the ages br br when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good compared to antz the rival film of the time this is much more realistic and less cartoony the water is rendered nicely as is the foliage you don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production the reflections and moistness despite the smooth exterior shows the realism all the bugs are finely crafted too the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on whether for a small role or a more expanded one it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments while ant island is nice it is just the outdoors bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything from the ice cube trays as circus stands the animal crackers box as circus wagonÂcomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideÂand crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades everything is done right br br as far as much of the humor you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit i dare you to think of someone better our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louis dreyfus as princess atta as well as the always fantastic kevin spacey as hopper spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits yes a bug's life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar a tradition that has continued on with many tongue in cheek bug jokes laced throughout you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast full of those guy actors it is people like richard kind brad garrett and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs br br overall it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience there are joyous moments sad times and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters tuck and roll there isn't too much bad that i can think of saying about it
<START> apparently the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood i use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director andy copp's commentary which i didn't have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers won't have a clue what it is about br br gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage but unless they're also fond of pretentious headache inducing experimental art house cinema they'll find this one a real chore to sit through br br 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity if you've still got all your marbles you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watched the whole thing but am well aware that i'm completely barking
<START> this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matter br br the main character's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his her goal at least in my opinion br br to wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead
<START> i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library cary grant in a comedy set in the services director stanley donen so far what's not to like it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things when did all involved including some well known names realize they had a turkey on their hands and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects still pondering the first but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script the uncertain tone the lack of consistent and well developed characterization and the lack of rapport between the characters you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under rehearsed quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery i have to say however that i was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar jayne mansfield go away with the appearance of suzy parker what's to like about the film for me chiefly the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly like dignity generally speaking the film is nice to look at the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite even grant can't look elegant in his back to the credit side ray walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre hogan's heroes werner klemperer speak without an assumed german accent
<START> so let me start off by saying that i saw this movie as part of a bargain i was really bored one fine 1997 day and so i biked over to the movie rental store i asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was without hesitation he walked me over to lucky stiff he told me that he'd waive the 1 rental fee he said it would be wrong to charge more if i promised to watch the whole movie so watch it i did for free br br this movie is terrible god awful even i don't need to go into plot details read the other reviews the jokes make no sense the acting was terrible i know it was supposed to be a comedy but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting you might try to watch it as something to laugh at but it's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way avoid
<START> the title above is used to introduce the film gen to its audience gen is about a young doctor doga rutkay with an ill mother the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job while she drives we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital she sees the death body of a patient this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days br br two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide in fact they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions all their communication with outside world is cut off too there is no way out in those few days there will be more nasty murders now everybody suspects from each other br br in my opinion the idea is brilliant it could have been very scary indeed there are positive sides of the movie of course i really like the beginning of the movie especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital actings are okay some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie what i am saying is it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn't work well also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital lastly i would like to say a few things about the director i am sure he will improve this is his first attempt i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old that made me feel more positive about him and his future films i am not going to rate this film out of though
<START> everything a musical comedy should be gene kelly as joe brady doesn't miss a step and frank sinatra as clarence doolittle doesn't miss a note scenes with them together are very good showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot sinatra's i fall in love too easily is an indication of his then and future best kelly's mexican hat dance with a young mexican girl is delightful kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor and there is a bushel of truly funny lines like you think the navy takes dopes you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep and we got in a little trouble we picked up a little kid a thoroughly enjoyable movie just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii
<START> baseketball is indeed a really funny movie david zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again in a really silly but many times smart comedy br br the 2 creators of south park the main actors in this film play very good surprisingly good actually but this is the first time i see them as actors the movie oftenly reminded me of south park one of my fav shows br br it's a really good and funny film so don't miss it br br vote 7 5 out of 10
<START> why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour divorced women with indifferent daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on tv it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis and rhoda would return to nyc but why couldn't phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course but it could have been better much better well there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion a dick van dyke show reunion hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again
<START> lil bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on comedy central it takes place in a fictional cartoonish washington d c and centers around the satirical childish representations of george w bush condoleeza rice donald rumsfeld and dick cheyney other politicians are also satirized in the same manner and act as minor characters br br the pilot of little bush much to this commentator's expectations proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production which barely delivers on its featured promise a satirical look at the current presidential administration while one must admit that premise of the show does have some merit even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired execution that can only be described as sloppy at best and downright awful at worst has marred what little potential the show had br br lil bush which may be technically classified as satire tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar but not particularly original entertaining or funny ways the show's consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording bush cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television as such most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichÃ©s some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already comparing the vice president to darth vader for example may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the daily show colbert report letterman conan o'brien leno monologue any late night talk show ever but it is not funny here as if that were not enough the show's plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old tiresome bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program br br in the show's defense when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke which seems to be a rarity it is often somewhat humorous if the show were to expand its depth somewhat and place its characters into new situations exotic situations rather than the same old mistakes and quagmires perpetuated by the bush administration therefore not having to rely on the same old bush jokes over and over again the show might be considered somewhat tolerable and possibly even innovative br br ultimately it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the lil bush series the most damage its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality or its painfully narrow minded ambitions it is reasonable to expect that lil bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans that is if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing so long as the program continues to lampoon the bush administration thoroughly even so the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation the price is right perhaps
<START> time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds they're fun to consider in a 'what if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek first contact' the 'back to the future' trilogy 'bill and ted's excellent adventure' 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage 'window of opportunity' heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film '12 monkeys' it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians br br bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget which is no particular surprise after the 'munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'don quixote' i would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved gilliam's description of the film as his 7Â½th release on account of the film being written by writers other than himself and therefore not really 'his' film' doesn't do the film itself justice br br brad pitt's portrayal of goines is curiously engaging although his character is not especially sympathetic watch for his slightly wall eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum it's disturbing and distracting br br probably a coincidence the louis armstrong song 'what a wonderful world' was used at the end of both '12 monkeys' and the final episode of the tv series of 'the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy' both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones br br '12 monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain it's not a mindless recreation that's for sure
<START> i grew up with scooby kinda the re runs of where are you i hate scrappy love daphne and feel its not complete with out the whole gang but this is sad scooby doo is mystery solving comedy not bad totally spy's jap anime i like whats new they had to give danger prone daphne a makeover sometime and try to lose the sex drug jokes of many a generation but this get a clue is flat out crap and should not have the scooby name attached they even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song now i'm gonna go watch my dvd of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes
<START> wow i just saw this on t v as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated g there wasn't really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a spoof but i don't think so for a spoof you need something called humor this low budget crap fest didn't have a shred of humor and it didn't make much sense either you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets killing people i guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so i guess that's good enough br br the military tries feebly to kill the monster which isn't much larger than a man they have very bad aim then the military flees wow did this movie make the u s military look pathetic or what the monster while hard to kill doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks it was a slightly interesting yet a total alien ripoff br br what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality also why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless
<START> in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era br br however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example br br moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction br br the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie
<START> the idea of in the name of the people is good a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter and you could expect of the actors especially scott bakula to do some good acting unfortunately they don't in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking
