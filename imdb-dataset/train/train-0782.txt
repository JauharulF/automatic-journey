<START> my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock's psycho i was very scared and deeply disturbed i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way but none where satisfactory amongst those tried and failed were the birds night of the living dead the silence of the lambs the blair witch project ring the evil dead the sixth sense 28 days later the texas chainsaw massacre halloween near dark alien peeping tom the cell rosemary's baby don't look now witchfinder general friday the 13th and the omen that should confirm i was desperate long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse ÂÂ br br paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own called marianne dreams paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film i discovered the truth while on the internet i bought the film later that day br br i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book nothing remarkable about that then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house and i mean genuinely unnerving more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld eg an apple tree anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse a place to go to but still the problem remains mark can't walk so anna decides to draw her father in she gets her pencil out and gets too work but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes quote he looks like madman so anna tries to rub him out and start again but the pencil proves indelible that means nothing can be rubbed out then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action br br paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years the question is how dose the compare with psycho answer 1 the old dark house 2 psychological parental fears 3 a genuine shock 4 and very scary music
<START> this movie is another horror anthology it is rather good but it could have used a bit more i compare it to doctor terror's house of horrors though in this one the title fits it has four stories all somewhat connected by a house the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in he creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house this one is sort of predictable but it does throw a few twists in the end the next story is a bit more unpredictable and you really do not know where the heck it is going this one features peter cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch this guy buys the house but it is not the house that takes center stage but a rather strange wax museum the third story starts out rather good and features christopher lee this one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter the problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough it drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop the actor really gets what he paid for then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened though i was not very satisfied with the explanation as i don't think it really explained cushing's story much at all i think they needed a bit more back story for that one all in all though it was an interesting set of stories
<START> i loved the original scary movie i'm a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel i think the wayans' are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakes br br the movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now that's wayans quality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed 1 when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile he's saying it was just a booty call that was kinda funny 2 the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the short lived giggles are no match for the side splitting laughs of the first scary movie br br the rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap gross out gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone for example in scary movie i several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penis strangulation scene with ray under the bed was mind numbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone doesn't take a movie very far this was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately br br as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a 2 out of 10
<START> spider man is in my opinion the best superhero ever and this game is the best superhero game ever while it may be somewhat easy you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game it may seem hard to control at first but once you get the hang of it you will be web slinging like spider man himself br br the bosses while like the levels are somewhat easy are fun the first boss scorpion is incredibly easy to beat which shouldn't be so because as fans of the comic books know scorpion is one of spider man's most deadly villains the second boss rhino is also very easy the 3rd boss is venom who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game which definately shouldn't be the 4th boss is venom again this time he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy the 5th boss is mysterio who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game he is also one of the harder bosses but once again still fairly easy next boss is carnage who is you guessed it easy to beat but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight 7th boss is doctor octopus who is like all the other bosses easy but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield the 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game never in a comic book or cartoon i won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn't too easy took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries br br all in all a very good game i gave it an 8 out of 10 the reasons why i didn't give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring getting all that stuff will take a while though it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show the bosses are too easy and they should have used hobgoblin and or green goblin as a boss i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air they didn't use them in the sequel to this game either well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider man movie so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie
<START> from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work richard widmark stealing from a woman's purse jean peters pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast the b w photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters and because samuel fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john asphalt jungle huston in fact it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong but the payoff is not quite as strong br br jean peters is excellent as the hard edged girl whom widmark describes as being knocked around a lot she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro film in her purse for her boyfriend richard kiley something the fbi already knows about they're on her trail when the theft occurs br br thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life she's particularly touching in her final scene with kiley br br this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark peters and ritter
<START> to start off with since this movie is a remake of a classic the rating has to be lowered already since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski it helps br br isn't this just like the united states government though to terrorize one of its own citizens sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie but it is the truth the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife a wife who is in labor no less and may not make it br br there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife the words of the disc jockey br br there were some great shots of scenery in this film and great car chases and a lot of spirituality after much consideration i gave this film a 7
<START> hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began first any play on of the living dead invokes his holiness mr romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire and second my movie watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood skeptical we settled in to watch br br we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good hearted zombie film oh certainly the budget is low and of course the directors' amateurs friends populate the cast but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema cheap yeah but when it's this cheap you can clearly see where love holds it together br br ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night he dreams of moving out of oakland before this planned escape however his brother is shot to death in a drive by ricky's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911 injections of his lab's experimental regenerative formula sadly little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie chaos and mayhem i think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive by but then again i'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life how poor a judge in response to a gory scene involving four men i opined ah ha white t shirts on everyone so the blood shows up economical i used the same technique in my own low budget horror film jordan replied no that's gang dress white t shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result oh br br a lot of the movie is set in someone's living room so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere it surpasses its budget in spirit br br zombie explanation when man plays god zombies arise or perhaps follow fda approved testing rules before human experimentation br br contribution to the zombie canon this is the first zombie movie i've seen with a drive by shooting as far as the actual zombies go infection is spread with a bite as usual but quite unusually head shots don't work it's heart shots that kill zombies have pulses the absence of which proves true death and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar growl noises br br gratuitous zombie movie in joke a mercenary named romero groan br br favorite zombie jaguar noise little brother zombie of course
<START> entertaining musical where nathan detroit needs 1 000 00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices sky masterson to try and get salvation army girl played by jean simmons to go with masterson to havana br br 5 years later simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous elmer gantry there she was sister sharon and here she is sister sarah same temperament different story br br frank sinatra is that devilish nathan detroit he has been engaged to vivian blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit br br in a real change of pace sky masterson was played by marlon brando who actually did his own singing here br br the film is saved by superlative choreography those dance and singing routines are fabulous they are especially realized by stubby kaye as nicely nicely johnson br br all in all it's a very nice production
<START> dani reese witherspoon has always been very close with her older sister maureen emily warfield until they both start falling in love with their neighbor court jason london but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away br br this was truly a heartbreaking story about first love probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie i would give the man in the moon 8 5 10
<START> jessica a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy br br a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot there is really nothing more to it the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death br br immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of a straight to dvd effort unlike gems such as vacancy 2 the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straight to dvd movies a bad name the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense scares or tension even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring br br the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career br br many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges i'm not exaggerating br br the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs i stress the word few in that sentence this is not overall one of the so bad it's good movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre if you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the eye original korean version the grudge one missed call or phone br br i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica a ghost story to keep up the good work just forget this movie exists don't spare a thought for it
<START> men of honor has many great aspects to it good action sequences plenty of feel good scenes a good musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting mostly by robert deniro the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further it is a good story but it seems like it has been done many times before a person against all of the odds won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago it could happen but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c o of the diving school tampering with his final test however all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower before the movie ends deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film but admit it if it was all the truth it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes
<START> the sopranos 1999 2007 br br number 1 television show of all time br br everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time br br james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny br br while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real br br the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives which makes the whole thing more interesting br br credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning television's most complex and enigmatic character br br simply exceptional br br 10 10
<START> i'm not sure how related they are but i'm almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie or the story that it's based on very similar plotline and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar lost delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one instead br br this one moves very slowly but being a late 60s french movie that is to be expected of the style told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each overlaps ie hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie
<START> this is yet another tell it as it is madhur bhandarkar film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles ion and g y concepts to the indian filmy audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting what's new it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr mrs iyer what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with such as her roomies her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page 3 in her newspaper br br noticeable it is another good performance from mrs iyer she is likely to be noticed for this role she does selective roles but shines in them she is noticeably de glamorized and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover right verdict madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey br br is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g y folk the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co stars if they wish to enter bollywood br br in addition he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families br br this was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average movie goer who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
<START> blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense at one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring br br they begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them a girl says she bets they'll find a blue monkey br br yes thats it totally inconsequential to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement br br i'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose
<START> sleepwalkers is the first film which stephen king has written a script for given this and the excellent santo johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie you would be expecting a odd and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience unfortunately that's not what you'd be getting the thing is they could have probably made it a good movie the beginning is intriguing what with it's small town spooky atmosphere but something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film the film turns funny for no apparent reason from that moment on the whole atmosphere of sleepwalkers is ruined for those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old johnny screaming out cop kabob after jabbing the pencil into that one cop's ear but don't get me wrong the humor has no redeemiing quality i just rented it again to see if mabye i was wrong the first time around given how original the plot sounded but i was right man what a waste i can't believe they got the rights to that santo johnny song i gave this a 2
<START> not only is this a great african american classic comedy but one of many great american cult classics i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies this is for you they don't make movies like these anymore my entire family are movie buffs so this site is an extreme help on solving many debates i am deployed in iraq right now this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states thank you imdb i recommend this site to all my friends dolemite rules don't just take my word for it check them out for yourself ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think but if it gets the point across i'm all for it
<START> a movie about the cruelty of this world i found it liberating as only truth can be it also contains some quite funny bits some of the acting is extraordinary see maria hofstÃ¤tter for instance the director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible succeeding coherently the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard core movie although i hardly understood a sentence i found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost the voice of the character played by maria hofstÃ¤tter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber br br my favorite movie
<START> i registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already the acting is worse than subpar it expounds on commonly held stereotypes has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no brain and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man br br including but not limited to allright lets see what these guys can do i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves eddie griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way he may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn't allow for that kind of character exploration you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys oceans 11 this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience br br even the cars can't make up for this fluke of a movie that enzo that griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly it just sucks
<START> ursula andress' naked body is one of those things that make you believe in god the other two women especially the one who plays the maid have great bodies as well then why is the higher grade that i can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10 because to get to ursula's unbelievable body we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring keep in mind that i watched the full 101 minute version not the 78 minute american one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material in typical italian comedy tradition most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures the army freak the latin lover the constant drunk the naive maid that are not funny simply overacted final word watch this but keep your finger on the fast forward button you're gonna need it
