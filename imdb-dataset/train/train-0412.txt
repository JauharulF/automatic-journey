<START> he's stocky sweaty slightly cross eyed and restless he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert he claims that we Â the film viewers Â perceive the screen as a toilet bowl and are all secretly wishing for all the s t to explode from the inside he's unpredictable and scary wellÂ come on you could have guessed by now he's one of the leading philosophers of our age br br slavoj ÂiÂek is both a narrator and a subject of sophie fiennes' extraordinary new film a pervert's guide to the cinema fiennes illustrates a feature long lecture by ÂiÂek and does so in two ways by providing exemplary film clips and putting ÂiÂek on real or reconstructed locations from the movies he speaks about it's always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies although revenge of the sith got here as well but the main attraction of a pervert's guideÂ is ÂiÂek himself what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again what is more outrageous ÂiÂek's views or ÂiÂek's screen presence in a documentary by astra taylor ÂiÂek 05 slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent because he claimed he feels like he doesn't exist in the first place the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly and talk he did and how also a pervert's guideÂ is dominated by his voice Â delivering perfect english in most crazy way and making some astonishing points about the cinema br br what are those well for example he sees chaplin's reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself kind of alien force taking over the human being Â think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night 45 he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects not to provide us with them he identifies groucho marx as super ego chico as ego and harpo as id he says a million other interesting things and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him so persuasive and captivating are his looks at some point i couldn't help but stare at his thick scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath craving of course for more insights br br most notable are ÂiÂek's readings of lynch and hitchcock which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of ÂiÂek's lecture memorable and Â unlike others Â difficult to argue with since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors this doesn't go for his reading of tarkovsky for example upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality dismissing precisely what's so remarkable in all tarkovsky namely strong religious intuitions and images br br the question isn't whether ÂiÂek is inspiring and brilliant because he is or whether fiennes film is worth watching because it is likewise the real question is rather are ÂiÂek views coherent one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride but after the whole thing is over some doubts remain for example while considering vertigo 58 ÂiÂek states that what's hidden behind human face is a perfect void which makes face itself only a facade something of a deception in its own means however when in the final sequence we hear about the ever shattering finale of city lights 31 as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another it's hard not to ask what happened to the whole facade thingÂ why should we grant chaplin's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novak's of this same privilege in two bold strokesÂ or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacan's terms the name of the notoriously unreadable french psychoanalyst is fundamental to ÂiÂek's thought the film has all the virtues of a splendid two and a half hours lecture lots of ground are covered many perspectives employed even some first rate wisecracks made when ÂiÂek travels on a melanie daniels' boat from the birds 63 and tries to think as she did he comes up with i want to f k mitch but it has also one shortcoming that isn't inherent to two and a half hours lecture as such it's almost obsessively digressive ÂiÂek's yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of ÂiÂek's perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on changing subjects constantly overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant cool fizzing wave you're simultaneously taken by surprise refreshed in mortal danger and confused no end as you finish watching your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you're already planning on re watching some films Â but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity br br the ultimate question is did ÂiÂek lost it or haven't we even came close to the real thing once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other not having any movies around to turn our faces to i dare you all who will have enough guts to approach ÂiÂek and defy him my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life you become a believer
<START> the scarecrow was on of the funniest killers i have ever seen in the act plus he's really bouncy most of the time he jumped around which was awesome also he had an excellent voice i mean it was just perfect for him the story lines was excellent too i like how the kids soul was transferred into scarecrow that was cool plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to him i would be angry too scarecrows look was really good his look gives that person an omg reaction when they see him which was great the stares he got were funny those people were stupid who would stare for that long they should of glanced and ran for their lives even though that wouldn't of made a difference
<START> the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation a woman and the senate read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it won't come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> dolph lundgren stars as a former cop boxer who searches boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother who was well thought of in the community however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame dolph lundgren is very good in this movie in fact on the basis of his performance here one would forget lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with in fact lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible co star danielle brett is also good in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent however the movie is lackluster the action is non existent the plot not given enough exploration too much boring b s around lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous once again lundgren is actually really good as is newcomer danielle brett but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next which makes this movie particularly disappointing if anything else though it shows how underrated lundgren is as an actor br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways it's better than close encounters of the third kind i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but that's a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesn't make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties many of which were low budget independent productions themselves
<START> having just welcomed home my 23 yr old daughter from a year in iraq camp anaconda medical support unit i felt compelled to get this dvd i wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all americans to begin the healing of our returning vets emotional void the paramount statement of the entire movie is take action on the problem incredibly emotional movie i would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning gulf war enduring freedom vets br br fast forward nearly one year later my daughter has seen this dvd took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re up for another 6 years her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good local balad children got first rate medical treatment for various common ailments not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator her look over her shoulder at her iraq tour was we changed some hearts and minds back there great dvd you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
<START> i have not seen each and every one of chanÂ´s movies but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far br br the story in it self is nothing special really so i wonÂ´t go deeper into that what makes it special is the stunts the fighting the good acting the warm sense of humor the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it all the cool stunts of course made by jackie himself makes you want jump around in the couch and scream itÂ´s just awesome even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it br br i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of at least it is here in sweden but i can assure you itÂ´s worth a try
<START> a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film the blonde wig half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self indulgence by its makers br br the wong faye half featuring a very playful if karen carpenter looking faye wong holds much more appeal all the ingredients are there however the girl meets boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness character development is uneven emotion is missing br br for music lovers wong faye's mung jung yun cantonese version of the cranberry's smash hit dreams is used effectively in chungking express faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called zhen tuo both are on cd although only mung jung yun is found on the official movie soundtrack cd
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen horrible acting not funny at all and well just boring br br i can only assume all these 10 out of 10 fav all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise br br idk what the runtime on this movie is i'm sure its listed on this page it certainly felt like an eternity br br if your looking for a tough challenge attempt to sit through this awful movie br br otherwise br br don't waste your time as i did on this one
<START> even though ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitler's life and yes this is dramatised but essential robert carlyle plays hitler during his later years during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany including the night of the long knives this tv film also a two part mini series shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power e g the financial disaster of 1930 br br the series follows hitler and little else apart from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl all in all valuable and filled with interesting actors yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography most actors are portrayed in half body shots which for me makes for a theatrical stance not cinematic the tempo is at times drowsy and the film does suffer from it being approximately 2 5 hours long
<START> just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival and enjoyed it thoroughly br br great writing and direction excellent and believable interaction among the cast and great comic timing as well br br this movie touches on themes that are universal family and separation as a result i can see european asian and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives br br if all that wasn't enough this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year somebody distribute this in the usa please br br finally thank you maria flom it really is a great film
<START> i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week this is a real problem that far too many afican american families have dealt with and continue to deal with the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study law enforcement including local state and federal are also complicit what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending seemingly television can deal with almost any subject matter except race this is shameful get it together or don't explore it next time
<START> i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would recomend it to a friend
<START> i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf just the title alone peaked my curiosity so i decided to check it out and i was surprised it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story is it low budget yes can you tell that it's low budget yes but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film all i hear is worst movie ever have these idiots seen every movie out there there's thousands of movies out there how can you categorize one as the worst ever a video not movie like zombiez may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs listen if you don't like minority based urban films the ghetto films hip hop etc then why watch these types of movies knowing that you don't like this type of stuff sure this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi cultural based cast i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o c they suck to me films like garden state wedding crashers and i heart huckabees suck to me i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me why because i can't relate to them they don't peak my interest just common sense believe me i will never watch garden state 2 garden salad wedding crashers 2 here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring now back to this movie in regards to saint405's comment above i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked stupid by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me everyone did a great job the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off anywho i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this bring on the sequel i'm out jerzee representin'
<START> hello i am paul raddick a k a panic attack of wtaf channel 29 in philadelphia let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time br br going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails or so i thought sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound the babes were supposed to be engaged but actually they get executed by sawtooth the meanest cannibal the world has ever known adam sandler fared bad in going overboard but fared better in big daddy billy madison and jen leone's favorite 50 first dates man drew barrymore was one hot chick spanglish is red hot going overboard ain't dooley squat end of file
<START> this is the best movie i've ever seen br br maybe it's because i live just a few miles from the village were the story take place and i know how things work out in this area in sweden the movie tells the truth believe me it both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of dalarna and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives br br but if you live in another small village anywhere in sweden or another country you will probably also recognize much from this movie br br thank you maria blom
<START> this movie is such cheesy goodness br br a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school they start getting killed off they know they are being stalked so what do they do one girl decides to take a bath another decides to cheat on her husband who is also there with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at it br br and it comes through with the gore and the t a br br and it's also interesting from a historical sociological point of view where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves or how adults view young people or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective this is a brit film made to be an american slasher it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak american unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents br br if you like cheesy 80's slashers like pieces then you will like this one
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen i was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough the plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character i could get more entertainment watching static i gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers avoid this movie at all costs
<START> intelligent wry and thrilling the invisible man stood out in 2000 among sci fi's usual lineup balancing out farscape 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue the show sat between law and order and doctor who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that i man 's characters went beyond caricature even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper the official and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic paul ben victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable the show's low points are still entertaining and i've never seen such taut pilot episodes matt greenberg and sci fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show every time i come across a marathon of hercules the legendary journeys on sci fi i roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that invisible man and its ilk represented
<START> josh hartnett's dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a buddy cop comedy here's 3 reasons to hate it avoid it and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better br br the buddy cop movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than hollywood homicide br br what really did happen to this entertaining formula since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same you'd have a buddy action stubborn flop after another i'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well i spy 2002 national security 2003 taxi 2004 starsky hutch 2004 and the worst of them all yet miami vice 2006 br br i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already add to that particularly here the negligent dealing and the dull humor actually the matter this time is totally unbearable yes we've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs and the background of sinful city but what else was new it's not about clichÃ© it's about few renewals mixed with clichÃ©s where both have been badly made br br the acting especially from hartnett 's side is terrible this guy is anything but a comedian or actor so his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death revenge on yourself man he probably died out of watching your acting even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy or that's what they seemed here anyhow br br the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh some parts managed to be highly dull arresting the black guy through the lack it's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action comedy they didn't utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm or even as a place which's full of shining or fallen stars cameos that could've given it few interesting moments br br it's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars' glamour and as being a buddy cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non chemistry on the screen one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself guess who and a buddy cop destroyer more than movie god don't make me or my children live enough to witness hollywood homicide Â part 2 at last look at harrison ford's performance he wanted to have a good time but at least we didn't
