<START> the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel br br journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three london novels absolute beginners city of spades and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed and rightly so this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy badly acted soporific one dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london and does nothing of the sort br br thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it
<START> i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didn't deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters v san for vampire sanitation going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad i don't expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn't one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical of the acting dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn't well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she didn't seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i don't think it is then it simply doesn't succeed too much is lame daft unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it didn't appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i'd say
<START> best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials period this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent however a gold god don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself its zorro and his band of men to the rescue reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen its simply a great action adventure film the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period its super and highly recommended
<START> and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know br br 5 3 the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace br br true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it's true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine br br it isn't
<START> i didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade trinity i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's blade so i did my quick research checked the scores on imdb rottentomatoes for dracula ascension and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing br br now let's take a quick personal recap here i remember seeing dracula 2000 and i remember not liking it at all and then seeing the scores of dracula ascension just lowered my expectations even more but then again i'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself any movie so that i can form my own opinion br br a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it's low budget so because of that i'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story acting i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie jason london roy schieder jason scott lee br br oh geezÂ this movie was cheesy but cheesy can be entertaining at least i found it pretty fricken laughable the bad audio synch from the re recording of dialogue in a few scenes the stupidity of the characters in this movie sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things luke even had a book on it but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get 'infected' nope this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on br br i also must've blinked at some point because i'm not sure how 'dracula' got clothes on his body especially since he's big wild and angry i figure if i was in that situation i wouldn't want to be the one dressing him br br so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogyÂ it doesn't instead it's a 'cliff hangar' where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment 'legacy' oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies
<START> i have one word to someup this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the tribeca film festival people in the theater were sobbing this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less fortuate then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west
<START> an excellent period murder melodrama with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down that's fine because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful una o'connor the screecher of james whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations i hope to see this film on dvd someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film fortunately i got to see it on amc some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since catch it if you can
<START> insisting that martin luther king's inspirational spirit resides not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere danish helmer niels arden oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 danish middle school more specifically it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named frits janus dissing rathke against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster svendsen bent mejding adapted from a true story the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving a battle of ideologies between a 13 year old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a dead poets society more than a matilda it treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off frits as a young boy becoming a young man manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money
<START> sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics 'the strange vice of mrs wardh' and the unforgettably titled 'your vice is a locked room and only i have the key' but even so i wasn't expecting too much from this film the case of the scorpion's tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion but i don't know why because this is at least as good as those two dario argento may be the 'king' of giallo but with the five films that he made sergio martino surely isn't too far behind in some ways he even surpasses the master all of martino's films were released prior to the jewel in argento's crown the magnificent profondo rosso so back in the early seventies martino was the king the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man his wife inherits 1 million and it isn't long before there's people out for her blood when she turns up dead shortly thereafter an insurance investigator and a plucky attractive young journalist follow up the case br br the case of the scorpion's tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech but it does have two of martino's collaborators on board most famous is george hilton who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark along with a number of other giallos hilton has a great screen presence and every time i see him in an italian thriller it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast the beautiful anita strindberg who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again with several beautiful scenes the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting the score by bruno nicolai wardh excellently sets the mood but it is the script that once again is the driving force behind martino's success ernesto gastaldi the writer for martino's other four giallo has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre the case of the scorpion's tail is a quality giallo film and yet another success for the great sergio martino if you like giallo you'll love this
<START> elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence br br then you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90's hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadian french production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
<START> lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film br br there is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war unfortunately this part of the story is not emphasized instead we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer by the way bacall is as british as vladimir putin br br the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou as was the case with her memorable pilar in the 1943 oscar winner for whom the bell tolls paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double crossing counter spy for the pro franco group she is quite a vicious character here especially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide
<START> this movie is just plain dumb br br from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability br br mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths unlike marlow and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack br br other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book velda's dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however precedes the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy br br to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10
<START> how can you take her hard living glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent it's absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangster movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback mostly out of sequence seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that don't really happen and then later says that didn't really happen this happened see the apparent killing of the fake 'first ladies' what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for then br br terrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headache inducing directorial style 1 5
<START> i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen the movie follows the exploits of a rap group nwh ni rs with hats it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it's tragic break up following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn br br the movie is on a shoestring budget but it does not seem to matter this is a very well made well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent the main strength of this movie is the writing there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie it is unreal br br spoiler br br there are takeoffs on actual rappers like mc slammer vanilla sherbert ice cold tone def tastey taste and songs booty juice grab your dick etc rusty condieff has made an excellent film in the movie he plays rapper ice cold the movie does not quit it is funny from the beginning to the end br br the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie like tone def telling a record producer Âwhen you take the bus you get there' and the producer responding Âthat's deep ' br br the group portraying n w h has some sort of natural chemistry to them they work so well together and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is many rap groups had problems with violence with censors and like nwa the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics br br i like this movie because it is offensive there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way the movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap the funniest being of spike lee where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor as i said before the writing is just excellent br br i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release it is an intelligent controversial and even thought provoking film this is too much for mainstream despite the fact it is hilarious and nearly flawless in it's production there are no major stars but a lot of familiar faces including marc lawrence who plays tone def watch this movie at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it
<START> let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a sham with that said this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis it makes good arguments the gap between jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the gospels filled only by the writings of paul who doesn't indicate a historical jesus and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on and it resolutely ignores counter arguments presented by christian apologists the intellectual dishonesty emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker's old school who comes off like a reasonable rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot i'm sorry but revealing that average christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly damning evidence of christianity's fraudulence you may as well claim that jay leno has disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jay walking segment the interviews with experts can be interesting but the film is filled with too much of let's be honest the filmmaker just being snarky within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians and by the end the film becomes so self centered that there's no rational argument left just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood y'know maybe that movie could've been interesting but it's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus and it's so self congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film making acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor skip it
<START> come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted it's a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man's soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading br br sebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieu's viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together br br first of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieu's family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedric's attention br br when mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul br br the ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearby br br jeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedric br br while come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
<START> dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more chequered 2008's the bank job was fine the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak for instance br br still crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart br br i savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance br br hugely enjoyable
<START> le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer director ismaÃ«l ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalÃ© and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys br br reda nicolas cazalÃ© lives with his muslim family in southern france a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage his elderly father mohamed majd has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca and being unable to drive requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france into italy and on through bulgaria croatia slovenia and turkey to saudi arabia along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ghina ognianova who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda a turkish man mustapha jacky nercessian who promises to guide the father son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons tensions between father and son mount reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps and the father cannot comprehend reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to reda the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values br br the visual impact of this film is extraordinary all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects nicolas cazalÃ© is a superb actor be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer's son' and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film another fine film from the film movement this is a tender story brilliantly told highly recommended br br grady harp
<START> this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i don't mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store for once the film was everything we'd expected and more or should i say less br br the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script don't even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending br br take it from me this film is hilarious if you're into crappy horror films but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you
<START> what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude the sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people don't watch the show because it's violent it's not all about the violence it's about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i don't like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me it's a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that defines excellence and dares to be different
