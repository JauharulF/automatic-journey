<START> this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared br br the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand br br the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american

<START> this film is pure 'hollywood hokum' it is based upon a novel called 'not too narrow Â not too deep' by richard sale which may or may not have been interesting it would take research to find out the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start there is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic either in terms of events or characters it is pure hollywood fantasy in every respect two well known actors paul lukas and peter lorre are so under used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all they must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette hoping that the flavour will be enhanced the film is a ponderous attempt at producing a 'morality tale' and is so corny that it is laughable the story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in french guiana who want to escape from their french colonial prison through a jungle very much a hollywood set jungle with a rubber snake naturally there has to be a woman in the story so joan crawford hams it up as a down on her luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to clark gable one of the escaped criminals crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions crinkling his brow as was his wont smirking and looking suggestively at everybody which was his manner of acting it is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be clark gable that surely he hasn't any time left to be a thief attention seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people not see them the whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment an attempt at religiosity and 'depth' is made by injecting into the story a mysterious 'angel of mercy' who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate he helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths helping them to find 'peace' in their last gasps this character is played very well by ian hunter who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge smiles enigmatically makes cryptic prophetic remarks and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow the theme is meant to be redemption you might call it the donald duck version of 'hollywood goes moral and gets heavy' for real depth hitchcock's 'i confess' of 1953 shows how it should really be done by contrast this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of meaning were in tinsel town and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something all they could come up with was you guessed it more tinsel
<START> damn straight this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today i can't wait to track down some of the dvd's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes i've already introduced him to voltron the 5 lions one not the 15 vehicles one and i laughed my head off when he said to me one day dad you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid how cool is that br br come on hollywood dust this one off and give it a live action attempt couldn't be any worse than spiderman 3 was man oh man 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies br br ok i'll shuddup now br br cheers
<START> i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious the gamers by dead gentlemen productions which is highly recommendable by the way boy what a disappointment the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing true it can be funny to use every singe clichÃ© there is about role playing games but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top there is no subtlety in this movie if there would be captions laugh now or a cheap 80s style fake laughter track it would not make much difference with some scenes you can't help to think yea i get why they thought this would be funny but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke

<START> this movie is made for asian chinese market targeting particularly fans of jay chou one of the biggest music star in asian br br jay chou is a very talented song writer singer he is mediocre as an actor although he did appear in several big budget productions initial d curse of the golden flower amazingly he won both golden horse taiwan and hong kong film awards for initial d br br the supporting cast are very well chosen which appeals basically everyone from china the cast including many famous movie tv actors singers even sport commentator huang jianxiang from china however they were not given enough time to show their talents br br the biggest mistake is that chu took over both director and writer position he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non coherent scripts with his poor directing and lam story the whole talented cast fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted br br however the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars maybe even more in asian which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian br br the bottom line is you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay chou
<START> it wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good combining dreamworks animation and computer graphics this is the story of a mustang later named spirit matt damon providing the first person narration and his journey through across the frontiers of the old west basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse he manages to throw off all who try to ride him however when he escapes his cage along with little creek daniel studi the two of them form a friendship oh and he obviously has a thing for little creek's female horse in the end after a few more escapes being chased by the colonel james cromwell and his men and making a final big leap across a gorge little creek lets spirit go and he also releases his female horse and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses also starring chopper bernet as sgt adams jeff lebeau as murphy railroad foreman john rubano as soldier richard mcgonagle as bill and matthew levin as joe i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film but it turns out to be more like a dumbo thing throughout and the songs by bryan adams aren't the most engaging but it isn't a terrible film it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan adams' here i am okay
<START> in my opinion this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70 br br the artists and animated did a great job in my opinion this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design animation are extremely smooth and realistic for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see so everyone did a great job it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters if not the sexiest that beets typical anime girls with ease br br unfortunately there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment first the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies and is really old fashioned by modern standards second due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs finally the setting is not so popular at the moment br br conclusion a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian but not to a novel
<START> this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television station's late show the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart the playwright producer director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made i did not see the movie again for over 30 years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on vhs poor video quality but good audio my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well known and fully employed actors e g judy holliday edmond o'brien jeanne crain barry nelson don taylor karl malden peter lind hayes george superman reeves red buttons lee j cobb kevin mccarthy and gary merrill the scenes with the b 24 liberators are terrific especially the close up shots where the details of the giant for those times 4 engine bomber then 18 000 manufactured now nearly extinct can be seen good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew of course very gender biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots the women just supported them in their roles hardly acceptable in today's world i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy
<START> in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed sometimes a bit of a mess br br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie poirÃ© the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren't better marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearable br br of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poirÃ© takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding br br a labored and disappointing follow up anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial br br
<START> i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this movie br br a gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening 3 4 minute scene with scat is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him sid the sloth voiced by john leguizano however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie br br ray romano is the voice of the mammoth the big character of the film literally while denis leary is the ferocious bad guy turned good sabertooth tiger br br this isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive language wise br br if more animated movies were this good i'd own more
<START> before viewing please make sure you have seen night of the living dead this might well be the best 7 minute parody i have ever seen absurd crappy 'special effects' the rope the rope and maneating slices of bread what more do you need br br do not watch this movie while eating bread you might get scared
<START> this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen thanks to rick baker et al back in the late 80's i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three jc sh yb i wasn't sure what to expect when i payed my hard earned money to see this in a triple bill of classics at the old scala i need not have worried i was left breathless by this movie if you're a fan of hong kong action kung fu movies and haven't seen this movie do so now
<START> caught part of george 2 on tv recently but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end just awful i can't even remember the plot all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie which was bad enough there's a lot of scrambling around but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen and that is saying something jeez because of imdb's 10 lines rule i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made for tv sequel disney hang your head in shame
<START> an mtv style film crew consisting of american t v programme producer zack zardine matt borlenghi his camerawoman the australian cecily kate fisher and two surfer 'dudes' named bog hall dax miller and jeremy joel west arrive on some nice looking island somewhere it's not actually revealed where the crew plan to shoot an expose on 'bloodsurfing' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks just to see if they can out surf them without being eaten once there they are greeted by sonny lofranco cris vertido and his wife melba susan africa their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of lilo cay sonny melba and their daughter lemmya maureen larrazabal take them in their boat soon after arriving and having already shot some 'bloodsurfing' footage sonny melba and lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say 'owns' the island the boat is sunk zack cecily bog and jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives however after a run in with some erm well i don't really know what they are pirates drug smugglers revolutionairies fat ugly people who just don't like being with other people who knows and more importantly who cares not me that's for sure anyway after escaping from these guys who look like pirates they are picked up just off the coast of the island by captain john dirks duncan regehr and his girl arty taryn reif as tara reif the film crew believe they have been saved little do they know that the crocodile and captain dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren't going to stop him captain dirks heads back to lilo cay for a final showdown with the giant man eating crocodile br br directed by james d r hickox this is one awful film but it's still not as bad as tobe hoopers crocodile 2000 everything about this film sucks the script by sam bernard and robert l levy is terrible extremely slow as the crocodile isn't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time i was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by bernard and levy the whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive the crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it's movements as the water splashes become huge the cgi shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch there is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using cgi to digitally remove the actors legs again it looks terrible there is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off there is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye there are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too in one sequence cecily is filming bog and jeremy 'bloodsurfing' but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time and surely that is the whole point of her shot when dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots in one shot the angle of the line looks like it's coming from the sky in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface i could carry on like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it's so smart as this film tries to make out but i would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if i listed everything that was wrong with this film so i won't i hated this film but rather scarily it's still not as bad as tobe hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film definitely one to avoid
<START> if you want to remember mj this is a good place to start this movie features sweet tunes mj as robot and a crazy messed up plot i recall many a night passing out to this fine feature film in college and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of br br there is lots of singing lots of dancing there is lots of singing while dancing mj slays it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff but there is much more to this movie there is claymation there are fat children clay there is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off obviously clay too there is joe pesci as well not made of clay br br rip we love you michael it is a sad day for all of us
<START> the choke aka axe in the uk is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight to dvd movie i say supposedly because the title of the movie does not have the v in brackets to indicate that it was a made for dvd movie even though it does have the appearance of one br br the plot is simple Â a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one br br i think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece but this does not excuse the faults here even straight to dvd movies such as bachelor party massacre which has a very low imdb rating have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so called so bad they're good movies however the choke falls far short of being either a serious slasher such as halloween or being a so bad it's good movie such as the nail gun massacre br br the movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill the blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget but from there onwards it's downhill all the way br br there are so many faults in the choke that i could spend all day talking about them but a few obvious ones stand out and i'll go into them br br the aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops there seems to be only around 8 people left and yet they're all meant to be locked in br br the characters in this movie are not likable at all most of the band members are aggressive foul mouthed morons or just downright weird no one really cares about what happens to them and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched the highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church seriously he spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason but sadly even his presence can't save the movie br br there are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation as in other straight to dvd movies such as crocodile and grim weekend the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all there are plenty of over the top outbursts mainly from the male characters and one nearly results in a full blown fight in fact the format could be said to go as follows characters walk around murder takes place characters walk around murder takes place you get the idea br br the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f word being used perhaps this was meant to be funny but it just comes off as sad and more to the point we have all seen this done a thousand times before usually to much greater effect br br the movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all the dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger a maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons they make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves and much of the time they don't even pretend to be scared br br in the same vein as drive in massacre the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed a random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question there is no one seen stalking the characters at any time in drive in massacre this served to make the film funny unintentionally of course but here it is not funny at all br br and as another reviewer has pointed out the soundtrack includes music that is very bad even for those who like punk rock the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it the score at the end there is no music at the beginning consists of a band of sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie br br don't misunderstand the points made in this review this reviewer likes bad movies such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor party massacre as much as the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th but it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either and even as straight to dvd movies go this is a poor effort br br on a positive note the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes but when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion br br fans of the traditional 1980s b movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie and fans of the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it
<START> when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the 4 for 20 dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks let's put in something else i'll admit a few of the lines from the friends at the cafÃ© made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over or under doing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film br br anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie it's the most pointless thing i've ever had the displeasure of watching do not watch or buy this movie
