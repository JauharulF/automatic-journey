<START> okay we've got extreme verhoeven violence although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks we've got plenty of sex and nudity but something is missing oh yes it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci fi movies i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor but unlike most verhoeven films the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films br br what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story not the cast or characters but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible the crew has truly made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects effects done on set the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible br br the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive here it takes place at a lab for the most part i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it or let's say steal something from people's purses or something like that but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie grade b
<START> this early biograph short was so much fun to watch the second on disc one of d w griffith's years of discovery dvd set highly recommended it features three excellent performances by the main leads and interesting to see henry b walthall the little colonel birth of a nation as a campy musician giving a countess the eye and other things br br the countess' husband goes berserk at his wife's betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour it's kind of incredible that they wouldn't hear the wall going up but hey maybe the wine had something to do with it here mr johnson father of silent player raymond hackett gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama but in an unexpectedly comical way the best moment comes at the end as the lady passes out from shock and fear once she realizes she's doomed henry picks up his instrument and fans it over her the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy and i just lost it and laughed my head off the expression on his face from that moment i was charmed by henry b walthall
<START> wouldn't it be great if not another teen movie actually put an end to all of these stupid pointless i'm getting more sex than you are teen movies in a perfect world yes yet this one is even worse this one is not humiliating for the stars it's humiliating for the distributor all of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have no interest in seeing yet it's funny devon sawa who was actually good in final destination is just plain dull in this movie it makes you wonder if it's being bad on purpose grade f
<START> i so love this movie the animation is great for a pokÃ©mon movie the cgi looks so awesome i love the music in the movie so great they kept the japanese music br br as for the story its great it has a great feeling of friendship celebi is a very cute and powerful pokÃ©mon ash is really great in this movie and i like his friendship with sam the only thing i didn't like was suicune's appearance he just suddenly pops up helps ash co a bit and leaves they could have made his part in the movie a little bigger br br but overall awesome movie can't wait to own the usa version on dvd
<START> i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
<START> as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark maybe i wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me
<START> the cult of personality has elevated the status of roger corman sam arkoff lloyd kaufman etc as kings of the b's because the folks at crown international were so key they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve a film like the van may now seem like a disposable piece of drive in esoteria but it was a sizable hit when it was released not to mention subsequent re releases as a double feature with other crown hits br br the van was a perfect example of crown's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie goers at the time of a film's release here it was sex drugs rock 'n roll and the brief custom van fad as others have noted it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a chevy when the title vehicle is a dodge in the film itself i had a town selectman where i was at the time even declare these vans to be dens of sin on wheels a perfect ad line for the film br br there are the usual assortment of good and bad girls muscle heads and low brow hijinks including a supporting bit by danny devito in many ways this isn't much different from the old beach party movies of the 60's but now spiced up with nudity and drug use obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some by today's standards certainly un pc views of women br br the classic touch is a toaster for bobby's den of sin on wheels yes a toaster hey you gotta have something hot for those munchies br br grindhouse fest
<START> this movie had a good story but was brought down because it didn't have enough horror film elements and violence it was like watching a live action cartoon it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going
<START> after seeing this excellent film over 100 times i still find new things that blow me away with this movie great special effects incredible acting and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well best movie ever
<START> twelve monkeys is an insane time travelling action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996 unfortunately he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane br br this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis brad pitt and madeleine stowe twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece br br 10 10
<START> although this isn't a great film there's something compelling and memorable about it like another commenter on the film i saw this in childhood it's been thirty three years since 1952 but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title see it if you have the opportunity you'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades more than any other film this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century progress it's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one furthermore it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time
<START> i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about so one saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as the kid all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain darling nicki and i would die for you all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling i also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with apallonia i liked when prince and appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts
<START> getting lost in space frozen for 15 years that's unlikely falling into a star improbable falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ludicrous getting rescued by a ship just then priceless br br no it's not zaphod beeblebrox's heart of gold to the rescue it's also not the parent of the year awardees after sentencing her daughter to two years' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the film's action combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away who obligingly simpers in the line of fire br br in the end the family of three abandons the metropolis sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the psycho's fighter ship which they've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0 7 kiloton missile you have to love those hard sci fi statistics br br as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel
<START> chilly alienating adaptation of rebecca west's book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired now there's an original idea it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks this extremely well cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co stars jackson christie ann margret and ian holm but the burners are all on low there are a handful of good scenes particularly whenever jackson is on screen but bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled out color is enervating long on the shelf this soldier is best left forgotten 1 2 from
<START> dev anand or prashant and zeenat aman jasbir janice are siblings brought up in single parent families jasbir the sister grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs prashant the brother on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman the story marks prashant making efforts to save his little sister who is perpetually in a trance from a hostile hippie environment this movie stands the test of time commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it
<START> three part horror film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go out there and unfortunately gives us three tales to prove why br br the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos it leads up to two totally predictable twists still it's quick about 15 minutes violent well acted and well done predictable but enjoyable br br the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money his car breaks down he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic very obvious badly done and extremely slow even at 30 minutes this is too long good acting though br br the third is just barely a horror story it involves a beautiful lonely woman looking for mr right it has beautiful set designs a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene but again predictable and not even remotely scary br br it ends very stupidly br br all in all the first one is worth watching but that's it tune in for that one then turn it off
<START> i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania this tells something certainly about the value or maybe about the lack of universality of the film but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries even in eastern europe br br the film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published it tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the stalinist era basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released his release is actually only apparent romania of the 60s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison br br the film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actors stefan iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega star we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art although suffering from a hesitant story telling and falling sometimes in non essential details or character comics the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society
<START> what a time we live in when someone like this joe swan whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker or even a filmmaker at all where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent we need them bad and to hell with mumblecore br br this movie is about nothing just as the characters in the film stand for nothing it's this horrible so called gen y that is full of bored idiots some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting well orson welles was a filmmaker john huston was a filmmaker fellini was a filmmaker dreyer was a filmmaker etc current films like these show just how stupid young so called filmmakers can be when they believe going out with no script no direction no thought no legit camerawork everything shot horribly on dv no craft of editing no nothing stands for rebellious or advanced film making nope it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema and there actually is an in your face jack off shot so be ready br br look at the early films of any accomplished indie filmmaker linklatter morris allen lynch hartley jarmusch jost lee or herzog none made anything as tedious and aimless as this yet swan whatever the hell is still going to sxsw every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy new talent it's crap i can't imagine anyone liking this and everything else this so called filmmaker has done all seen by me is just as bad the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience one of the sitcom calling steer clear unless you're a friend or family member of those involved on second thought if you're a family member or friend you'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations br br utter garbage this isn't art this is the ultimate opposite of it
<START> in the voice over which begins the film hughie billy connolly a roadie for the great 70's band strange fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit's set was that god was sick of 70's excess indeed it's been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome antidote to it while i agree the excess was tiresome as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it and like punk i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this film about strange fruit's long strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days br br one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes brian gibson directed what's love got to do with it about tina turner while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers dick clement and ian le frenais co wrote the commitments and were behind the music oriented british tv show over the rainbow and the songs strange fruit played were co written by foreigner's mick jones not to be confused with the clash's mick jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about also two cast members are musicians in their own right bill nye i don't know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music oriented though i forget the name and he was in evita and the others are convincing at it and while as i said a lot of 70's bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women the movie doesn't make the same mistake except for the woman who follows timothy spall around as the manager of the reunion juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character br br the other actors are all good as well with special praise to stephen rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality there are a couple of plot points which don't work but overall this is quite enjoyable oh yeah and the music is good too
<START> the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is slaughterhouse rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a title previously held by urban legends final cut from its opening scene i could tell it's going to be really bad but i was so bored that i couldn't care less this film contains laughable acting especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the crappiest music i've heard and i'm living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves the biggest problem with slaughterhouse rock is that it's not funny one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one liners here and there but no we have tormented guy's self centered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler and please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night no one if you're going to make a horror movie at least make it believable this one is anything but
