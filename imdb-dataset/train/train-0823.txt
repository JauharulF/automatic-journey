<START> spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major h lots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
<START> i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i couldn't help but missing before sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and yearning to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other it sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me who doesn't believe in nora ephron before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it when i saw it for the first time about 8 year ago when i was 20 i already liked it but i didn't rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie linklater was too smart to make it more realistic it was 10 minutes too long the characters was too well fabricated i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations etc etc but now thanks to before sunset i feel that's more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before i saw the elements more clearly jesse celine vienna their conversations everything how each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time i am no longer feel manipulated and the freedom that every scene has as well as its refusal to be overly efficient how blind i was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when i first saw it now 8 year have passed the more movies i've seen the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters's own slackers included the jesse and celine tale avoid that maybe before sunset is a better example in this case but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life i don't know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it meanwhile i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset and celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i've seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don't know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful paris is and no matter how happy i am that they meet again i'm sorry that i go on this long with my limited english before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it
<START> to my surprise i quite enjoyed 'spacecamp' i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they don't make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot absolutely loved the robot named jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think
<START> fairly good movie but not a true story br br rubin hurricane carter was a notorius liar a murder and was never found not guilty new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone carter got an offer in 1976 pass a lie test and go free he didn't take it this film should never have been made but money talks a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white why choose a fake story br br jens
<START> i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post screening survey i felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot instead it was composed of too many sub plots competing for screen time as a result there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment what the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters in fact any one sub plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub plots and characters simply put the hungry bachelors club's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired
<START> it's amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow 'stargate sg1' is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci fi br br following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate' this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore sg1 is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods br br the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness br br almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers sg1 also excels in humour from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn't just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall
<START> i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won't but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i'm looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it's very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it's done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you've got the chance you really should see it
<START> some spoilers br br i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline unfounded belafonte is great as a brandoesque menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill equipped from his past life to do so he learns too late how empty his hustling materialistic life was without love mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny in spite of his prayers for a miracle his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other the result being hilarious and touchingly sad br br the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film after looking everywhere for belafonte mostel looks up to see a falling feather and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles but belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle either to restore fanny's health or mostel's faith so he never got his wings the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel's grasp a metaphor for both men's live it's too late and you don't get a second chance like it's a wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic
<START> i hated this show when i was a kid that was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents not just the bland generic general american dialect we're used to jack wild had a british accent and pufnstuf's was southern like one of the others mentioned though i never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute that always seemed odd to me probably because the flute just annoyed me and i wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away br br just a comment on the similarity of pufnstuf to early 70s mcdonalds commercials that others have mentioned pufnstuf ripped off mcdonalds at the height of mcdonalds popularity the tv show or rather their creators sought to license mcdonalds characters for their show but when mcdonalds declined the tv show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own they even hired former employees of mcdonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the tv shows mcdonalds sued and won search for pufnstuf mcdonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it
<START> gypo nolan victor mclaglen is as poor as anyone on earth living in 1920s ireland gypo and his fellow irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive brits one particular rebel wanted for murder by the english arrives back into town secretly he thinks he can trust his friend gypo but the Â£20 reward proves too tempting gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness meanwhile the other irish rebels are searching for the informer right away gypo with money burning a hole in his pocket is their main suspect but they who are his friends don't want to believe it the story of the informer is simple in its plot but complex in its moral and emotional issues it's easily one of john ford's most emotionally involving films what gypo did was wrong but we can certainly understand his motives we also understand his sorry character and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him the script is very suspenseful as well it's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it the acting is remarkable victor mclaglen who acted in many of ford's films probably gave his best performance here and won an oscar for it every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos in addition to an amazing script and acting the informer is one of john ford's most expressionistic films i love the darker side of ford in its mood as well as in its themes the informer reminds me of two of my other favorite ford films the long voyage home 1940 and the fugitive 1948 it's also a bit similar to the grapes of wrath 1940 in these respects 10 10
<START> horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl boring tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we're supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum he's kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a tatum fan like me which is why i rented it in the first place please don't see this movie she is really bad in it and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasn't because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well but still don't rent this movie and if you're a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a fossil
<START> although i am generally a proponent of the well made film i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point br br pasolini's work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography this is true of decameron pasolini often preferred to use non actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under pasolini's direction his non actors tend to remain non actors this is also true of decameron pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience such elements can often be used with startling effect but in pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film this is also true of decameron br br i have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire pasolini's films even so i have never actually met any of them and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me judging him from his works alone i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker i find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious and this too is true of decameron it is also sadly true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure
<START> the barbarians maybeÂ´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen but really itÂ´s so funny i canÂ´t discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw it the director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie but itÂ´sso misirable bad so bad that itÂ´s one of the funniest movies iÂ´ve ever seen so my advise is that you should see it and if you alredy did se it again
<START> this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess they've just copy paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages the producers must have thought let's create a hollywood movie here in belgium they didn't succeed now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at 22h45 or something in the past we have had really good movies in belgium like daens shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie if you've seen 10 minutes of shades you've seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon
<START> after watching awake i led to a conclusion director and screenwriter joby harold made awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements for example the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor the concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film with the exception of the great lena olin all the actors bring bad performances hayden christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for jessica alba the extraordinary actor terrence howard is enormously wasted on his role awake makes a laugh of the spectator it's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously my recommendation is skip this crappy movie
<START> having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff one's hat a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carrÃ© minis about smiley has quite different qualities br br in the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show the rest of the actors just support him one can say br br here it is ensemble and story that's important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isn't charismatic at all br br egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handler br br never have the machinery behind a spy and or traitor been told better after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy' as his czech handler calls him br br and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you've veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyone's happy as long as the flow of faked information continues br br magnus's father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a no good con man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad br br his czech handler alex expertly played by rÃ¼diger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of non existing informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men br br the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference br br indeed well worth the money
<START> i saw fever pitch sort of by accident it was playing on the airplane going over to europe it actually wasn't half bad ben jimmy fallon is the world's 1 red sox fan but his relationship with lindsay meeks drew barrymore may strain that the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples' relationships it's especially eye opening now that the red sox have ended their 80 odd year losing streak i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don't tend to notice them not too bad br br another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000's frequency check them both out
<START> jeux d'enfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just don't know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow older and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great people br br one could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away from br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups bill paxton julie warner kevin pollak elizabeth perkins vincent spano matt craven and diane lane who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka a camp in ontario canada by their former consuelor alan arkin writer director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense also the movie has plenty of funny moments some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite the one involves using masking tape newton thomas sigel the usual suspects three kings provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness among the cast sam raimi director of the evil dead films and the gift appears here as arkin's bumbling right hand man one more thing this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders
<START> star rating unmissable very good okay you could go out for a meal instead avoid at all costs br br stuck up career bitch kate franka potente heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney however after a hectic working day she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform as she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next however she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there br br in a lot of ways the british film industry is really becoming one on it's own especially in the horror thriller department with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later which this has strong echoes of in parts in terms of succeeding in what it set out to do creep does cleverly create especially at the beginning a scary sense of isolation and tense fear at it's clever running time it also though inadvertently i suspect manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through out without really focusing too much on character development and such br br of it's weaknesses some scenes are a little predictable but these don't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way i'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it's not exactly perfect but it's certainly very effective and serves it's basic function very well
