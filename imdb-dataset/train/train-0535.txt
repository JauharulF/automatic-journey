<START> best animated movie ever made this film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely boggling effects but the branches of the human mind soul and philosophy the story features a family of cats where in the big sister dies the younger brother sees this and rescues her body but when she awakens she is left without a soul so the two sibling cats embark on a journey to find it i have related this journey to many things the history of the world the bible the cycle of life and every time i watch it i discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors if you aren't so into the physiological aspect of it then you will still adore it the animation is superb and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen for example the ocean freezing in time god eating soup out of the earth a strange and slightly snm retelling of hansel and gretel to conclude cat soup is an absolute treat for anyone br br ps not for kids gratuitous violence included
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting the writing was top notch james arness is a great actor and he showed it here brian keith was too old to be davy crockett and can anyone really play davy but fess parker br br another great actor in this move was raul julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times br br while some may think the movie was slow paced it captured the battle as it unfolded lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror br br what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time
<START> everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have if u can get this movie on video for around 10 itÂ´d be an investment
<START> i am currently sitting here forcing myself to finish this i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs might as well suffer for it i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for war of the worlds cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time and i missed the old tv series from the early 90's the website make it out that this was a multi million dollar budget rendition of the classic book it was going to be a perfect translation perfect crap is more in tune with this film br br first off the video on this movie was glitched it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid 90's pc or playstation cd rom video game sadly enough the color quality was similar the acting made shatners classic dramatic pause look damn near shakespearean in quality the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes br br secondly it is slow and terribly drawn out i sat thru 45 minutes of the video no promo's at the beginning before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien after that the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk crappy down even attached to a mechanical arm the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's the last thing on that for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's no one is concerned for their life it's like they have no concept even though media was slow word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known the illusion of day and night was shoddy at best simply changing the color around the people to purple blue or green does not signify night time perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero gallop around or walk down silly roads get on with the film i know how people get around you do not need to be so in depth br br now finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student the animations do not match up to the scenery at all br br in closing folks if you want the war of the worlds do one of four things 1 watch the 1953 original 2 watch the early 90's tv series 3 wait for spielberg's rendition to be released shortly or 4 read the frikkin book something we all probably did in elementary english class avoid this movie it is a waste of your money
<START> this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode they meet a freaky librarian type dude very well played then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100 000 years in the past kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen awful world by some bad guy br br spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out anyhow they all finally escape leaving the poor cavegirl behind it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves you can literally taste the sadness at the end leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human albeit in a not so nice neighborhood br br anyway you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode a love story the salem witch trials spock as a human the desperation of being left in total isolation abandoned and three entirely different settings on the alien planet its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film this one is a classic don't miss it i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans
<START> currently this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made which is exactly why i rented it from netflix however i am saddened to report that the film while bad is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one hardly a glowing endorsement but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list br br the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way they are married in real life as well he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave once there they behave very very very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat according to this film bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us both of which are not true at all br br oddly after being bitten the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately but not this boob soon he's having seizures yet he still isn't interested in seeking help again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history br br after a while he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital but by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine the wife who like her husband has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerous even after he attacks people steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road br br now most of the time moss is going through these episodes his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person oddly however a couple times he develops bat like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat like had this been really cheesy the film would have merited a 1 br br in the very end in a twist that hardly made any sense at all the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974 br br overall very dumb the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real not a good film at all but not among the worst films of all time either br br note for some reason imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it's alive and it's two sequels of the web page for the bat people while the bat people has been seen with the title it's alive the two movies are not at all related it's easy to understand the mistake especially since they both came out in 1974 but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell
<START> what can one say about elvira that hasn't already been said in the world's press the classic comedienne that is elvira delivers in her first full length big budget comedy masterpiece br br from the very first movie frame thingy elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says film great eat your heart out bette davis see a forlorn elvira see an excitable elvira see a jealous elvira see a murderous elvira you can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess br br at the heart of this comedy masterpiece is elvira's desire for las vegas show stardom despite putting the boob back in the boobtube as a horror hostess with the mostest elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally and physically nuff said she packs up her kitbag and heads east a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer outlining her inheritance 'windfall' in the other br br i've seen this movie so many times i can almost recite it verbatim verbatim would just be showing off br br grab a copy laugh yourself silly learn the lines br br why she didn't win the best actress oscar for this role is beyond me
<START> hollywood north is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like toronto in this case later in vancouver peter o'brian the director probably saw a lot of the invaders from california that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that canada presented br br needless to say moon lantern the successful novel written by a canadian author is turned into flight to bogota which has nothing to do with the original film a great egotistical has been michael baytes who is obsessed with what is happening in iran is offered the lead part which turns to be a disaster br br the film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth which seems to be the case with the ultimate product which is saved by its producer bobby myers with the help of sandy ryan who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in toronto parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last br br the filming process is hilarious and the acting in general is good
<START> let's value it br br entertainment a trashy script which has been typed by unintelligent people in front of typewriters a thousand times pathetic acting that is thwarted by the story ok production value including good set location and gorgeous girl rating 4 10 br br social message the movie has no social message it's thought free but if i pretend i were 10 and my iq were 70 i feel the message is don't be afraid to love rating 0 10 br br objectionable things nothing special just the mild jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude that is presented by the writer director generally speaking good nothing degenerate 8 10 br br overall rating is 4 10
<START> if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should that's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes unlike marilyn monroe in that film jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means br br and it's men of means that jean harlow is after she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it her talents as a chorus girl are limited but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty br br her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone but unbeknownst to jean stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices br br lionel's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son franchot tone after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree br br the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship i've a feeling we would have seen a much more risquÃ© film still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated what a great comic talent that woman had seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later br br ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde thelma todd harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma todd would also die a year later in a freak accident suicide homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given br br don't miss the girl from missouri it's bright and sassy must be from all that sparkling jewelry
<START> i was watching this movie on friday apr 7th i didn't see the last scene cos i was talking with my bro n mom in law at the same time anyone can tell me what happened to her i watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door she's dead already br br what happened to her did she kill herself how could she arrange everything like the phone calls meanwhile she's at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer anyone can explain to me please i am so so curious in the end i read that she suffered from multiply disorder personality br br thnks before
<START> this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 the gun that won the west to cowman outlaw peace officer or soldier the winchester 73 was a treasured possession an indian would sell his soul to own one br br winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father riding into dodge city with his trusty friend johnny williams millard mitchell lin runs into dutch henry brown stephen mcnally the man he wants but with wyatt earp will geer having taken all the guns from those entering the town both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle a competition that lin eventually wins but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize dutch ambushes him steals the rifle and skips town fast as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle the rifle will changed hands a number of times with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches br br very much a benchmark for what became known as the so called psychological western winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past tho shot in black and white the only one of the duos westerns that was the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback and in silhouette amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city it's just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states br br stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors the support cast isn't too bad either shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo while mitchell mcnally geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings there's even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far br br originally the film was a project for fritz lang who even had the script ready to run but lang walked away from it something that proved to be a blessing for western fans for as great as a director that lang was with mann directing and with a new script from borden chase robert richards in hands it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre not only with the further efforts that mann stewart produced but also in who they influenced the likes of budd boetticher nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes and gleefully for the western purists they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further br br a big hit at the box office back on release winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age 9 5 10
<START> this movie has always been my favorit disney movie then on 11 21 01 i saw the 30th aniversy of this movie dvd wow i remembered why i loved this movie the dvd is so great it has an extra 30 min that the original did not have i did not know this when i first started watching the movie made ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been left in you have not seen this movie until you have seen the full 131 min version a lot of people say that the music is forgettable i remember every song in this movie by heart every song has it's own charm by it's self and comes together as a hole i remember when i was younger i had the eglantine song stuck in my head for days at a time as well as briny sea that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the film please watch the new uncut 30th aniversy movie and re vote for this movie the 10 that it really is
<START> i saw the original chorus line on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater michael bennett knew he would have to re imagine chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it if the man who came up with the show is stumped that should answer your question there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live with an audience however richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of ghandi and dancing with animals in doctor doolittle ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show horrible songs were added surprise surprise great songs were dropped or given to other characters which didn't make sense michael douglas was mis cast people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy landers woman who couldn't sing act or dance i guess she had just finished being ghandi's wife the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from flashdance rejects and nothing works i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was a chorus line has any thing at all to do with this film
<START> i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dream like quality the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiser br br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 it seems more a trick for 2003 br br if you can find it watch it you won't be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
<START> i don't know why i like this movie so well but i never get tired of watching it
<START> despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants not on the payroll apparently br br a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes in a later conversation she said imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears and be laughing in the aisles excellent story and photography be damned br br so watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong i thought the last samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time
<START> tell the truth iâm a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it i was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie br br iâm surprise at this movie all completely â it is like a kidâs movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing iâm not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account br br synopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak br br just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and havenât we already seen the same characters play by mc lovinâ in so many other movies like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep br br well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is so so as expected when youâre watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie br br anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie canât really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone br br pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes br br cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix together br br rating 3 5 10 grade f
<START> plan b has the appearance of a quickly made unedited sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved an outing that should have been nixed from the start it is just another mafia based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating br br joe maloni paul sorvino is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control his personal assistant mario anthony desando is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny maloni has whacked one of his debtors who just happens to be married to bookish fran diane keaton and maloni takes fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being maloni's 'hit man' fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out maloni's assignments electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to florida to hide at her brother james' house until she can figure out what to do next this alternative to killing the three candidates is called plan b plan a being to kill them the ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters br br diane keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch paul sorvino is well the paul sorvino type cast from other mobster films the supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick pratfall fashion imaginable what is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone director greg yaitanes needs to go back to tv sitcoms had this flimsy story been compressed into a half hour gig it might have had a chance grady harp
