<START> i read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it since i'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey it is a lifetime movie br br the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses br br the female cast is right out of desperate housewives i've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist is there nothing original anymore sure but not on lifetime br br the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose br br in one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do kicks him in the testicles what else women love that but let me tell you girls something it's not as easy as it's always made to look br br it wasn't all bad i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that
<START> i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom what really horrifies me i mean truly disturbs me is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as 'delightful' or a 'must see ' i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants br br the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten it is decidedly unfunny poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold canned rice pudding to be kind to ms kramer the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity for having read the synopsis before i watched it i had expected something more challenging the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co dependence the unexpected awakening of 'sisterly' sexuality and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from br br instead the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations with clichÃ©d characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction the lack of directorial control seems astounding on the one hand moynahan cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances while heather graham and molly shannon the latter in particular veer towards embarrassing over compensation at times one could lay the blame for this on the director maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over act they will force a bigger laugh from the audience but then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better br br sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make and for whom given the possible issues gray matters alludes to and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead i know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone but whatever direction she takes inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard
<START> written on the wind is a douglas sirk's melodrama douglas sirk was rediscovered by the cahiers du cinema fassbinder etc that hailed him as a master director i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography written on the wind offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors but i ask myself is this enough to carry a film the acting in written on the wind ranges from weak to fair excepting robert stack he is convincing as the weak spoiled playboy lauren bacall normally a powerful presence in the screen is miscast in this film dorothy malone as the seductress the care free femme fatale is ok but she lacks the strength for the role rock hudson is efficient but vapid br br the plot has very interesting ingredients the main characters are br br a rigid patriarch br br his alcoholic son kyle robert stack never loved by the disappointed father br br his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee dorothy malone br br lucy lauren bacall a woman of principles formerly a secretary and now married to kyle br br mitch rock hudson brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch br br secrets beyond the door a love triangle frustration fistfights laughter death etc well when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat my mistake why i'll try to explain written on the wind takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story as i said before the acting in general is not good enough the intensity is lacking there are many strong scenes in the story but the actors just do an efficient job i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully they would end for us in an explosion of laughter or tears br br what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk for me this is not enough if you want to enjoy a good melodrama see aventurera
<START> i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the post wwii era illuminate universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's late spring and 1953's tokyo story i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery it is taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film among with co screenwriter t'ien wen chu hsiao hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable br br the story concerns yÃ´ko a young japanese writer researching the life of mid 20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese after 25 drawn out minutes of character set up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan at the same time yÃ´ko's coffeehouse friend hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her hsiao hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with ozu's style hsiao hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular yÃ´ko's plight seems rather non committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable br br the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable j pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yÃ´ko while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime the rest of the characters barely register even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yÃ´ko's parents cinematographer lee ping bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots hitoto speak sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits hito shian the dvd includes an hour long french made documentary mÃ©tro lumiÃ¨re which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao hsien's approach to the film it includes excerpts from ozu's films in particular equinox flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set ups there are also edited interview clips of hitoto asano and hsiao hsien as well as the film's trailer
<START> i can't really say what i think about this movie its against the guidelines i've watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget i'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a b w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasn't enough but this is my 2 cents worth i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money
<START> this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your shower cap
<START> spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 7 10
<START> this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap stick cartoon or a hyper realistic hallucination br br boringly directed by william marsh in over saturated hues a group of public school drop outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug taking and that's it except for the ludicrous sub plot soon to be the main plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures be it political or pampered within the first reel you know exactly where this is going br br what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents avoid
<START> muscular man ape in the jungles of africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team the comely daughter of the team's leader finds him first much ballyhooed version of the tarzan tale has an ok production but is crippled by the single handedly worst direction of a film i have ever seen john derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow motion action shots and peek a boo glimpses of wife bo derek's unclothed body he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood trying for tongue in cheek sexuality the dereks lack finesse snappy timing and taste they have a sense of self parody and bravura abandonment they do throw caution to the winds but after a promising opening it all goes to hell miles o'keeffe who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time has the title role but plays third fiddle to john derek's ego and bo derek's sense of self importance from
<START> the director and two stars of laura 1944 were reteamed for this solid policier dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and one night he goes too far gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and andrews' no 1 nemesis gary merrill who had himself been the protÃ©gÃ© of andrews snr as usual with preminger this is a well crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes karl malden as andrews' incumbent superior tom tully as tierney's motor mouth taxi driver dad and neville brand as merrill's chief thug with notable support also coming from craig stevens as the slimy wife beating victim bert freed as andrews' sympathetic partner and robert f nolan as andrews' stern outgoing superior having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else andrews panics and impersonates stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the in this case wrong tracks of merrill however after tully becomes the prime suspect by which time andrews and tierney are romantically involved the cop goes by himself in merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder clearly the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in house fox noir style
<START> the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman writer of mirrormask and it's really a good story i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman i won't spoil it for you br br the main character tristan tristran in the novel is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some bickering princes br br it's a really good story it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages it's simply magical it's a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s
<START> this film was excellent i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre this one however got all the ingredients a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi and he sure did that a lot
<START> this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick flic
<START> i really wish i could give this a negative vote because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film the acting was just god awful i mean realllyyyy bad the dialog was worse the script sounded like it was written by i can't think of anything horrible enough to say and the day outside and the night inside shots make you think the events took over several days terribly acted directed written etc etc all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone stay away from this one at all costs if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed it is to tell the world to not watch this crap this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously
<START> heads hands and feet a band from the past just like strange fruit a triple whammy there those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing sad for them this is an achingly well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing stephen rae timothy spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and bill nighy a new name for me as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self destruct br br the syd barrett brian wilson echoes are loud and clear mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty it's unfair on all of them the nearest comparison is the commitments and that's no bad thing and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig a band i do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about br br a small delight and thanks for the memory br br oh and i've got another one stiff little fingers a a and what about steeleye span spooky tooth ten inch nails anyone you have to see the movie or have been on the road
<START> bad actors bad filming choppy dialog shallow characters but then again it was a bad premise in the first place basically an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal of course the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house cash a check for 1 000 000 dollars and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges br br preston blake is an annoying obnoxious boy who decides that when written a blank check by a complete stranger he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words he wanders into a bank br br hands a teller a check he makes in his printer and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10 speed could not catch him even when preston jumped a row of cars br br of course with every hokey adventure movie there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting nor its sloppy dialog such as the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur it was rather the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts of course the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston who uses his 11 year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face then treat her to hamburgers finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two as they make their way to preston's limousine complete with a 1 dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on br br overall 1 10 is incredibly gracious for this film i don't see how it only has a 4 4 10
<START> in this muppet movie kermit miss piggy fozzie gonzo rowlf scooter camillia dr teeth floyd animal janice and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical manhattan melodies to broadway unfortunately no producer will even meet with the muppets after being denied by too many producers scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own however kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is br br this features many great scenes including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies a wedding sequence filled with muppets including the sesame street cast and traveling matt from fraggle rock scooter as a movie theatre usher and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast br br my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more sure many of them appear at the wedding but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen beaker beauregard and sweetums and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well after all rizzo the rat also performed by steve whitmire had a big part in this movie and he wasn't very well known at the time
<START> dave devon sawa and his friends sam jason segel and jeff michael maronna have scammed their way through college when creepy ethan jason schwartzman discovers their secret he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful good hearted student angela james king br br stupid and incompetent comedy a lot more groan inducing than laugh inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags but none of them work what's more it's full of worthless unappealing characters and schwartzman's character is so repulsive he's a major turn off movie even tries using 50's 60's sexpot actress mamie van doren in the movie's most outrageous scene yuck br br further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste yet again of veteran comedic actor joe flaherty's talent when's this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile br br all in all the only thing i liked was james a k a jaime king who was very appealing and deserved better br br this gets no more than one out of ten from me
<START> this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
<START> what can i say about this film other than don't see it i waited and waited and waited for someting or anything to happen and it just didn't come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly it's just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of pet monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they don't like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film watch at your own peril it's not even funny because it's so bad it's just bad
