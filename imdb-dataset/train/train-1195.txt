<START> i very nearly walked out but i'd paid my money and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wide eyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost aching anticipation but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage i was bitterly disappointed and enraged at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to reinforce this fact your honor i call jarjar binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first br br from the initial raising of the gate at jabba's lair this film was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many licensable profit making action figures as lucas could cram into it the pig like guards the hokey flesh pigtailed flunky that vile muppet pet of jabba's the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each on screen or less and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating br br lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot he just exhumed the death star from a new hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i can't shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans i've got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that i could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one it'll make me even more obscenely rich br br there may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell out to profit
<START> growing up in nyc in the late 80's early 90's club scene i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights voguing allowed people to fight within the confines of everything short of touching each other which would warrant an automatic disqualification seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented well orchestrated throw downs in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here pepper la beija paris duprÃ©e xtragavaganza etc all commemorated in the likes of such period pieces as malcom mclaren's song deep in vogue it didn't matter who you were or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this magic kingdom of sorts you became part of something bigger than yourself you were important and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination and anybody from anywhere could become king or queen as the case may have been the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor all of the tension excitement and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film brilliant please release on dvd for the world to see thank you
<START> i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night all i can say to describe this worthless film is 'trash' the acting is so badly done i've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out no feeling no emotion and no room to capture the viewer on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack br br the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've questioned a few things 1 if is 'serial insane clown killer' wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills clowns 2 if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her sad really br br 3 why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs this film is as sad as they come my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming
<START> no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am br br i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well br br not so royal flash br br i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel i still am but he was never really given a chance after that br br what a disappointment i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse br br none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic br br looking back with more mature eyes the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda br br if you have read the book and not seen the film i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented russian roulette br br a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about br br my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently but i am glad i have not br br if by any chance fraser ever reads this i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that corpus of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films
<START> lizzie borden's love crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality and including full frontal female nudity which sure beats the male kind it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory br br this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust br br one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses when the antagonist a counterfeit fashion photographer is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse he shoves a riding crop between her legs pressing it against her crotch and this greatly increases her excitement br br then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door br br patrick bergin plays the con artist and though he falls a long distance from handsome he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line by all reports sean young proves a weird person and she is scarcely beautiful yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination her performance is forceful and complex br br borden possesses an intriguing worldview and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate
<START> the poster who called this plotless and pointless literally took the words i would have used in my subject line the only thing i'd add is passionless for a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold dafoe and colagrande look bored during the sex scenes and the viewer might as well take a valium and have done with it also please the women in the audience have seen way too many used tampons in their time and any guy who is turned on by seeing willem dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina really needs to get therapy br br i think the key to the film if there is one is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepy eyed dafoe what a deconstructed jambalaya is all the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together this movie is a deconstructed thriller all the elements are there spooky isolated house dead spouse creepy violins on the score weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases auto accident deaths and near deaths characters with a secret past basically every thriller clichÃ© you can think of but nothing comes together everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece at the restaurant dafoe passes on the deconstructed jambalaya prospective renters of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf
<START> in my opinion this has to be one of barbara stanwyck's best performances she was one of only a handful of actors then and now who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue and i was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage too bad the movie is so short lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy her only link to anything is her good friend chico played wonderfully by theresa harris though chico is african american and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie and lily is not they have a special bond and it is not sexual just 2 women stuck or shoved into a situation beyond their control after lily's father dies and she does not know what she will do she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants yes it's immoral but that's the entire point of this movie then they had to go and ruin the last few minutes so up until the last few minutes of the movie it's a superb film and worth watching the lesson of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then and i'm sure will be a 100 years from now women it's awful what lily does in order to get what she wants but it works men take note
<START> warning contains spoilers br br i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy she came to mind when i reflected on the audience's reaction to the mother br br people gasped when may anne reid writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover darren daniel craig or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex br br screenwriter hanif kureishi my beautiful laundrette my son the fanatic again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the atlantic his story's not easy to take this searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw complex and often makes us very uncomfortable nevertheless it's powerfully good stuff br br kureishi and roger michell who directed notting hill of all things craft an unsentimental wrenching and superbly acted portrait of an older woman who realizes after all these years she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures in a wonderfully epiphanous moment when her son bobby asks her not to be difficult may shoots back why not br br why not indeed br br anne reid deserves an oscar nomination for her turn as may it's subtle restrained powerful and sad often all at the same time watch reid when may observes darren and paula cathryn bradshaw in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub or when she begs paula to open the front door after a disastrous date reid's eyes and face reveal all of may's anguish and despair in the film's most devastating moment may drops to her knees before darren willing to do anything for him only asking him to be kind this is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress br br i enjoyed michell's use of natural sound especially when may and toots first arrive at bobby's place it perfectly illustrated the cacophony around may and toots the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them br br this film at times reminded me of the honesty and rawness of mike leigh's work except the mother hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat br br my one quibble michell's decision to give may and darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility the lovers remain out of focus while in the foreground a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze and the only sound is of may in the throes of passion br br the problem with michell's approach is that both reid and craig who completely envelops the role of darren plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience especially since michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral br br this film doesn't have immensely likable characters we sympathize with may but she too causes her daughter's suffering but i doubt kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk his point i believe was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens it's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable
<START> in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was 23 and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday i'll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus' it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy
<START> jeremy northam struggles against a total recall clone script and disposable romantic by play to bring life to a confused character lucy liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman like finish you can't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the dvd when she uses the term femme fatal and romance french film noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together br br this movie fails not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period automobiles are very 1990's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques br br the technology is positively hilarious massive 2001 a space odyssey mainframes fed by man portable cd rom's with data collected for some unexplained reason in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un savvy technologist today would obviously be aware there is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open source nature of the cyber community research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time br br dvd interviews also reveal the original movie name was company man but this likely ditched in order to cash in on matrix hype the cypher title has only the slightest link with the movie terry gilliam would have done wonders with this concept and completely re written the decalogue br br this is tele movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production it might have made a good sub plot for alias
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i'm still laughing so as a shake your head in disbelief movie this one does well br br although it appears to have some 'known' actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort br br the graphics might have been good in the '60's or even early '70's but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out let's just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film br br it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
<START> the groove tube was initially shown on video in the first video theaters here in boston in one room there were tv monitors on high stands with old movie theater seats in small groups facing the monitors there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi and baskets of york peppermint patties in a second smaller room there were no seats just large pillows that was the 'smoking' room i e people got high in there that act only added to the hilarity of the video br br i was a 'frequent viewer' the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are koko the clown the kramp family kitchen kramp easy lube shortening safety sam vd psa the chevy chase hitchhiker w nude runs through the woods the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman the last item was very reminiscent of the late incredible ernie kovacs now i've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 who is ernie kovacs but trust me it's funny stuff br br one reason i was a 'frequent viewer' was that i and my friends would bring other groove tube virgins to see it we would sit and slyly watch the faces of the 'virgins' as the safety sam psa would play as the camera slowly zooms in on sam we would wait for that oh of recognition on the 'virgin's' face each time was more hilarious than the last and then that 'virgin' would then bring a friend to see the show repeating what we had done to get this joke you must watch the video br br yes some of it is dated but most plays film television and now videos are just look at any video made in the 1980's br br i did see the groove tube in a theater as a film a grainy transfer from the original video it had been cut and was missing some of the original high point scenes br br the first saturday night live show featuring chevy chase elicited instant remarks of that's the guy from the groove tube so it was a precursor for chevy br br i can't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice over coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy lube shortening and thinking of the kramp holiday loaf recipe always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store br br the early 70's were parlous times the groove tube was fresh new and really 'got' the humor of the times it offered a 'hip generation' humor that wasn't available in any other format medium mjh
<START> some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcpherson br br the story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters' hand as they make their way to a waiting car br br soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out behaving like she's nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion listening on the radio to 'sister alma' almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things i won't say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film br br in many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight jacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year olds i've ever seen plus she can really really dance br br my only concern about all this is that some might find winters' hyper religiosity in the film a bit tacky like a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so i took winters' religious zeal as just a sign of craziness which i assume is all that was intended br br by the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie roo another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great fun and quite over the top
<START> it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations characters and jokes of 'zavet' as well as of many other films of kusturica see for example the opening scenes with the remote village in the serbian mountains with the low tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of himself in the process br br this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case it's a fun film before all kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies his style is direct and grotesque we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same the space he develops melds present history and magic and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema br br this is not a perfect film either the principal flaw is the length some editing and shortening would have been useful as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up it is yet one of the most catching amusing moving films that i have seen lately
<START> if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy br br collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better br br one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort
<START> during the early 1980's kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united states inevitably men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that i have no idea what thomas was paid to make this film but i would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture the film is obviously derived from enter the dragon as are most martial arts pictures only instead of a real martial art they concoct an absurd new martial art accurately described by one critic as a cross between kung fu and break dancing a gymnast thomas of course is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress yet every room has a prop that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies of course he fights his way to the lead villain and of course they have a fancy dancy fight with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film there are touches which nostalgic types will like particularly the mullet haircuts of thomas and many of the male co stars have but the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set
<START> as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness i am not one of those people if i watch an action film i want to see explosions gunfire and heroics if i watch a comedy i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes you get the idea therefore watching a horror film i primarily want to be scared the grudge is a very scary film in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes and it's creepy imagery i've been a horror film fan for many years and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days if you want to be scared watch this film way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' which i also think is a great film
<START> a super comedy series from the 1990s two series were made in total that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling when you are up against established comedies like 'minder' even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed br br luckily i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly i mentioned it to friends and family at the time but everyone seemed to have been watching something else very very frustrating br br anyway i loved both series and never forgot it br br then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own' br br well both series are now available on dvd br br http www replaydvd co uk joking apart s1 htm
<START> this is probably the first entry in the lance o'leary nurse keat detective series in subsequent o'leary films he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee br br a group of relatives all played by well known character actors gathers in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma br br while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders br br a creepy film worth seeing
<START> i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film it certainly was not besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch br br i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer i only watched it because of some good comments posted here they must have been planted by people with ties to the film you may fool people into watching this but you can't fool them into liking what they saw br br i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming sure it failed miserably but it tried i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst br br do yourself a favor and skip this dribble i wish i had
