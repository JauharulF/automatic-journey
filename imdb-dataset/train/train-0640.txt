<START> listen i don't care what anybody says as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie cypher is not i repeat not a b movie cypher is an absolute masterpiece suffice it to say i am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime in fact i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me in fact i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie other critics of whom some downplayed the movie have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about don't listen to the haters and actually for the most part reviews of cypher have been largely positive and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie but it is also a fantastic movie cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever again the cinematography the backdrops the technology the storyline and the acting are all 100 world class top notch naturally i won't give anything away this is not a spoiler and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters i believe quite the opposite cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves blade runner 1984 brave new world total recall logan's run jason bourne and impostor and deja vu look out cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research 5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best hands down and hats off nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction the future is now
<START> one of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not borat or the departed but a 2005 documentary about jesus christ called the god who wasn't there by director brian flemming an ex christian fundamentalist flemming in his 62 minute documentary asserts that jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on pagan traditions using interviews with authors philosophers and historians to debunk the long held christian belief that jesus the son of god lived among men was crucified and was resurrected flemming compares the christ story with those of cult figures isis and osiris in egypt dionysus and adonis in greek mythology and roman mystery cults such as mithraism and finds many surprising similarities br br in addition to his evidence about pagan cults he also states that the earliest sources for the christ story the four gospels were written forty or fifty years after the date given for jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of st paul show little evidence of jesus being a flesh and blood figure flemming unfortunately however is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on christianity and all religion most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as biologist richard dawkins and author sam price the only christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as scott butcher the creator of the website rapture letters com and ronald sipus principal of the fundamentalist village christian school which flemming attended as a boy br br like michael moore's interview of charlton heston in bowling for columbine his interview with sipus is so contentious that sipus walks out in the middle in a sarcastic tone flemming tells us how wrong christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth then points to atrocities committed in the name of christianity such as those by cult leader charles manson who killed 11 people and dena schlosser who cut her baby's arm off for god he also lifts a statement from a book by lahaye and jenkins that says that christians look forward to the day when all non christians are thrown into a lake of fire howling and screeching to further turn us against christianity flemming shows us extended clips from mel gibson's the passion of the christ detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture what could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion in the process of condemning those who used christianity to commit unspeakable acts he ignores such people as socialist muriel lester a famous christian pacifist rigoberta menchÃº tum a mayan indian of guatemala who helped found the revolutionary christians and received the nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice and mother teresa whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity br br his most telling argument is his comparison of christian doctrine with the pagan cults and he makes some good points yet flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble christian doctrines there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300ad long after the new testament also it is important to note one major difference the immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god this is anathema to christianity which believes that a church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the pope are required to interpret god's will to mankind br br although i am not a christian and have some doubts about whether or not jesus christ was in fact a historical figure the truth is that in the long scheme of things it may not matter what matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man br br while i applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together while there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects in the words of annie besant spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect the god who wasn't there is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others
<START> ida lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system not surprisingly she also tackled proto feminist themes that when touched at all were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about in outrage she treats rape and its aftermath and though throughout the short movie it's referred to as criminal assault ' she leaves for once no doubt about what happened br br mala powers in her official debut plays a secretary bookkeeper at a big industrial plant she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy robert clarke who just got a raise and now makes 90 a week leaving the plant after working late one night she finds herself being stalked in the ensuing scene Â the best in the movie Â she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails br br when she returns home disheveled and in shock the police can't get much out of her she claims she never saw her attacker who manned a snack truck outside the factory trying to pretend that nothing happened she returns to her job but falls apart thinking that everybody is staring at her judging her she goes into a fugue state running away to los angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop br br waking up in a strange ranch house she learns that she's been rescued by tod andrews a young minister in a california agricultural town she lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges the two fall vaguely in love but it's clear to andrews that powers is keeping dire secrets when at a company picnic she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of jerry paris who was trying to steal a kiss the truth about her past comes out br br it was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental ending up talky and didactic yes lupino had important information to impart but she didn't trust the narrative to speak for itself her cast pleasant but bland and generic weren't much help either reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance but outrage was a breakthrough blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is and what it really means to its victims
<START> i can't believe anyone liked this movie i've seen a lot of low budget indie films but this one absolutely sucked low budget doesn't mean the movie has to be demented horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented there was nothing scary about this movie at all it was just a gore fest and a particularly disturbing one at that the acting was average considering they were all unheard of actors but the story was pathetic the dialog was pathetic the movie tries to come off as artistic or something this is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make but are incredibly well done this was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked that's because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie there were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all a complete waste of my time and money
<START> a quiet sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you a movie that makes you feel good all the ingredients are here old jelousy rivalry friendship and loyalty mischief nightly fridge raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers
<START> already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallacious br br when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies Â or anything for that matter it's time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the super ego i'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell it's like the premise of schumacher's the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess di's death br br however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoo's nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours it's like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions br br i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them Â unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days br br when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh's blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh's vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldn't have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i e the easily impressionable and the gullible br br zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don't laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood stained toilet while they were conceiving directing that scene talk about putting words into one's dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say br br i like zizek's initial thoughts on tarkovsky's terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in anti feminism and other nonsense into his theory br br zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the end goal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsd tripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001 s br br the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didn't feature more prominently that's another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynch's incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it br br zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier's laughable ground breaking physical set up in dogville made me snicker br br however zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin' obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener br br i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit br br slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kid's park near you br br http rateyourmusic com list fedor8 150 worst cases of nepotism
<START> i'm not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half but i'm afraid i just couldn't stand another minute br br if this abject excuse for a film doesn't have the late great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave then i doubt anything will br br the excellent review above 'not a film for parsons fans' sums up most of my feelings how dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which they're so clearly incapable of delivering what were they thinking where to start br br the script i thought i'd be getting a slice of bittersweet americana what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no clichÃ© left unturned stupid hippy check stupid fat cop check awful plot contrivances check embarrassingly written female characters double check total disregard for the story which you're trying to portray check br br after a while you realize that what you're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that scene with knoxville scene with ex girlfriend scene with knoxville which hasn't moved on much scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one and so on br br the direction my friends and i decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard that's how bad the direction was terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes god it was cringeworthy and then i discovered the director was an irishman who's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called monarch of the glen trust me it's lowest common denominator tv and then it all made sense br br the acting are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go if he's not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts knoxville just about manages to get through every scene poor christina a has no such luck her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines i don't know the 'hippy' in the hearse oh dear oh dear oh dear have we not moved on since cheech and chong br br i could go on but i think you get my drift what i would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the byrds the flying burrito brothers or gram's solo work they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology this film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to oh wait i didn't quite make the end and i suggest you stay away too
<START> of watching this as a child although i'll probably find it god awful now it was kind of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so i also recall working on a saturday afternoon puzzle while watching it so i wasn't really paying much attention however the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail 12 years ago one person mentioned that possibly he had seen it but he thought it merely a dream a fanciful piffle like wind it's no dream my friend no dreaming now again i haven't seen it since then but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr anything that can stay embedded in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a '10'
<START> there i was sitting alone in my flat on a saturday night with the choice of watching citizen x or the eurovision song contest and for the benefit of americans reading this i'll explain that tesc is an annual event where musicians from countries all over europe and asia minor have a song contest at the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was it's a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when i say that singing and songwriting isn't of the calibre of lennon and mccartney and i should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word choice is misleading because being a music lover i wasn't going to watch tesc under any circumstance br br so i sat down as the credits rolled for citizen x expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit but i'd be misleading everyone calling it that it's obvious within the first 10 minutes of citizen x whodunnit what the film does is point out the failures of communism a serial killer comrade this is the soviet union serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems this farcical attitude goes far beyond denial there's a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because it's the only warm coat he's got and of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll all this is very well done as we are shown that it's the communist party system that's on trial but about two thirds of the way through citizen x we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place it's at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film but don't let that put you off citizen x is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially donald sutherland as a paternal police chief br br strangely enough a few years ago i read something written by the famous criminologist colin wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight and i found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the soviet union after all media is controlled by the party and anyone who's old enough to have listened to radio moscow or read english translations of pravda will know that the ussr only reported news stories like potato harvests coal production and thank you letters from afghanistan cuba etc for soviet assistance the concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical but i guess if a tree falls in a remote siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it
<START> i don't know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70 year old woman and not angie harmon why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well
<START> the bourne ultimatum 2007 review after a thrilling set of two we get the final installment here's my take br br the bourne ultimatum has it all we have jason bourne matt damon on the coattails of the ones who know everything he has been running for too long this time it ends br br the bourne ultimatum has a great plot awesome writing fantastic direction suspense and some of the best action of the summer matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin br br there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing in a good way or cheering on or both i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping the audience was loving it br br the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift wrapped package all of the goods and then some this is in my opinion the best movie this summer br br the last word excellent conclusion the best of the trilogy this is how summer movie thrillers should be done i love the bourne trilogy
<START> first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies i don't read the books play the games wear the underwear or eat the cereal if there is one i am simply a fan of the films br br with that being said i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise taking this movie by itself and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors ep 1 2 i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script cheesy dialogue contrived scenes ie r2 suddenly being a badass and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch horrible acting and noted plot holes how is this good there was no real internal dilemma within anakin it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so which by the way was ruined by the noooooo frankenstein scene when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one liners when more could have and should have been said this is not a great movie for a film with such a dark tone there was too much levity in the speech of all characters br br i close with a question from the beginning to the end of the film was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place
<START> wow i watched the trailer for this one and though 'nah this one is not for me' i watched my husband and our friend's faces during the trailer and knew this was a 'boy movie' i mean hallo a bunch of chick barmaids that dance another striptease br br then i started watching it it didn't look all that bad so i carried on watching i watched it right to the end what an awesome movie if anything this is a chick flick these girls have attitude it is really a feel good movie and a bit of a love story really leaves you with a nice feeling br br basically the story of a small town girl making it big in the city after going through the usual big city c p there have been a couple of these it is almost a new urban legend but it also makes you think of your life and what you have achieved well me anyway i think it is because the whole working in a bar scenario is very familiar not just for me but for many people i know don't trust the trailers for this one it is aimed at bringing the men in
<START> i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep i don't think i'll ever forget it one scene especially i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking is imprinted on my brain br br i also watched the similar movie lilja 4 ever as referred to by a previous commentator it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol angels of the sun may stay with you forever br br this is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it br br more people need to see this film
<START> it was a doubly interesting experience for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar where like a deus ex ma china the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain intent on stealing some machines of theirs it is notable that in those two cases and in iq we are dealing with comedies so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro magnetic field theory into exciting dialog but then only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind maybe nobody really has tried br br subsequently after writing this i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago but that is an exception and it was a spoof br br the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert it was walter matthau here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor in both comedy and drama but normally his comic personas were variants of his whiplash willie gingrich from the fortune cookie they were connivers and gonifs later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them but they remained grumpy types but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet more like his kotch than like willie clarke br br he plays albert as good old uncle albert it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd meg ryan and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland stephen fry but fry's car needs repairs and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters tim robbins works robbins falls for ryan who is attracted to him but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires good old uncle albert aided by his three friends lou jacobi joseph maher and gene saks decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things as he hopes to do br br the atmosphere is sweet as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on by switching the positions of their bodies the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower keene curtis br br it was a charming comedy and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal but far more subdued
<START> honestly my expectations for little bush were low i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun but rehashed and overdone bush jokes apparently i should have lowered my expectations even more br br the writing was absolutely pathetic aside from the cheney chicken eating joke and some giggly little swipes it was really boring and unfunny br br the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen year old's flash project it's disgraceful that they used macromedia's product for this because it's capable of so much more br br i don't like bush that much and i enjoy a bush joke as much as the next guy but this was just a half hour swipe at the president with several painfully un funny moments trey parker and matt stone did so much more with that's my bush br br do yourself a favor skip lil' bush and go buy a copy of the short lived comedy that's my bush you'll thank me
<START> i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard lots of yawning though paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so called comedic movie
<START> words can't describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro what were you thinking so there's a mall and its parking space is totally full basinger's character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper br br when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place come on i won't even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one br br this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it it's a total waste of time honestly
<START> a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must
<START> this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day it's pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit 1 2
