<START> perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger's 'where the sidewalks ends ' from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel 'night cry' by frank rosenberg br br dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title 'why are you always trying to push me in the gutter ' he asks andrews 'i have as much right on the sidewalk as you ' br br dana andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta br br by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of 'laura' are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail br br using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise br br the film is one of the best detective films of the 50's with curious moral values also one of preminger's best br br preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism
<START> i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see
<START> think of the ending of the grudge 2 with the following br br a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine a cowboy a love story sarah michelle gellar cutting herself and a creepy mirror br br oh and underwater sea animals yay br br not a good movie i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching it i can't believe i went br br save your time and money go watch saw iii a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it br br im mike and im out
<START> the only thing serious about this movie is the humor well worth the rental price i'll bet you watch it twice it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role
<START> the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of disney classics br br it's not among disney's top works but is satisfying one of disney's most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and enchantment which old disney is well known for this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation if this was a failure there wouldn't be any more disney animated classics br br cinderella is somehow like a return to disney's 1st animated classic snow white and the seven dwarfs because it brings back the fairy tale genre it's not clear where the story takes place but i suppose it's somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perrault br br there are plenty of likable characters such as cinderella the prince bruno the dog jaques and gus the two main mice the fairy godmother for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the king and the grand duke br br jaques is very smart and amusing i love his voice really has that mouse like quality gus might not be that smart but he's humorous br br the king is hilarious but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too they're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments br br the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney no doubt that prince philip from sleeping beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similar looking br br on the other hand lady tremaine the stepmother isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold jealous bitter and cruel her daughters anastacia and drizella aren't much better than her however the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable by the way i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmother br br lucifer the cat is hilariously malicious the way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality he always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards cinderella lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat yet there's nothing annoying about him br br the soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among disney's best the best song in this movie is bibiddi bobiddi boo br br there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as james macdonald marion darlington eleanor audley verna felton and luis van rooten br br despite being simple looking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something out of this world however the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly majestic and colossal
<START> this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earth kind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenography br br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etc br br the female characters here are two subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a vulcan babe br br some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tng crew but creates interesting dynamics br br a very good pilot though for a very good series
<START> this movie for what it is may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day made on a super small budget the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films if you have a chance watch it
<START> standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process rÃ¥narna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense br br banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient military styled gang of robbers two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first br br as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again mikael persbrandt must be in every swedish film from the last few years but that's ok i guess since persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here like he usually does the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself first of all the robberies feel mostly like background rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then it spiced things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step br br in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind mostly hollywood it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting and forget about trying to make hollywood action light like they do now because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie industry i rate it 3 10
<START> chan wook park is nothing if not inventive i'm a cyborg but that's ok is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of marc caro and jeunet city of lost children delicatessen park embarks on a fanciful lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision it is genuinely unexpected then to see all park's effort add up to so very little br br i'm a cyborg but that's ok seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts the premise is promising gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience the characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast but try as i might i could not bring myself to care for any br br sympathy for lady vengeance was a misstep indicating perhaps that park was overindulging himself a little bit but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography was readily forgiven none of the assured confidence that commanded joint security area or sympathy for mr vengeance is evident here i'm a cyborg but that's ok left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time more regularly as the film progressed i gave lady a 5 10 and by that measure this probably deserves no more than a 3 for old time's sake i'll be generous 4 10
<START> save the 8 97 you'll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg br br i'm a filmmaker and being an avid fan of h g wells i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment instead it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time it's horrible br br there are reports that timothy hines had a 20 million budget for this production where the heck did it go did he use most of it to buy a new house finance his retirement or what let me start with what is actually good about this film it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible and i do mean horrible special effects any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi to me most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a 20 million project should be using br br there's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than 1500 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created i've seen films with budgets of less than 2 million look better much better br br in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines' special effects in this film in fact i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film there's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's b movie unless that was the intention which shouldn't have been with this particular project br br a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky another demonstration of amateur film making br br overall i have to say that i produced a 45 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film br br i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead it would be easier on the eyes
<START> we've been served a terrible film br br okay i'll admit that since i'm white and have had no practical experience in the competitive world of step dancing i might not exactly be an authority on this type of film on the other hand i do know a bad motion picture when i see it br br and boy have i just seen it br br filmed in low budget vision and directed by ian iqubal rashid a touch of pink how she move tells the tale of how important it is to follow one's dreams even if those dreams include bopping around to loud irritating hip hop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translator br br i'll try to give a small synopsis of the plot first of all there are two actors that look like ll cool j who work in an auto shop in toronto the mecca of racial diversity but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day br br there are a few other guys in this crew including a token white dude and a guy that looks like denzel washington in malcolm x there are also two women in the movie one resembles serena williams and the other looks like geraldine from the old flip wilson show one of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drug addicted sibling the other girl a member of salt n pepa no doubt is just plain no good br br there's another guy who looks like eddie murphy's buckwheat while still another actor who's a huggy bear knock off these guys are rival step dancers evidently this activity is very hard core in the 'hood and they are all practicing for the big step monster jam in detroit br br since i was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a bergman film or that one music video by snow it's hard to explain what happens other than there's a lot of arguing the serena williams girl who never smiles by the way becomes a freelance stepper moving from group to group there's some step dancing and a lot of irritating hip hop music br br it's a typical rags to riches story sort of like rocky with a really bad soundtrack rudy with annoying rap music in the background cry freedom without the laughs br br but why does a film which could have made a big impact on black audiences have to contain drug addiction bad parents and a title that sounds like a first grader saying the phrase how she moves br br i was moved by this movie however moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible
<START> well i guess i'll have to be the one to say the emperor has no clothes when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive i loved morse even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set and felt that while i always liked kevin whately's sgt lewis character the show was john thaw period after watching the new inspector lewis as it is billed here i am more convinced then ever that i was right whately is fine even though he looks awful both badly aged and too fat but he simply doesn't have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw br br and as for his sidekick fox well perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he's saying but i for one mostly could not br br as for ms innocent all i can say is that i miss james grout br br i'm sorry to say that they should have left morse rest in peace
<START> this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever shifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left sometimes very ostensibly unsaid it's about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all
<START> kids of whatever age do not want to know about their parents' sex lives and grown up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido lastly many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age br br the mother is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality a woman who isn't ready to stay home watch the telly and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades and a controlling dominating chap at that packs it in with a massive heart attack br br may anne reid and her husband have two children each dysfunctional in his or her own way the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture paula cathryn bradshaw is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer she's attractive not pretty and she seems to have a close relationship with mum at first br br back at her house after burying her husband may determines to not stay there rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure she goes to stay with paula who has a young son paula's boyfriend darren daniel craig is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may's son's house may is quite taken with hard drinking coke sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was for sure a fellow of the royal academy of cads br br what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive dare i say reborn widow the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama or debacle take your pick br br the theater in manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may's age that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement br br this blindingly honest look at an older woman's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband's desire that she stay at home and raise kids she also mentions he didn't like her to have friends what a guy surfaces a number of issues while may's dalliance with darren doesn't constitute incest there are real psychological dimensions and issues with a mother bedding her daughter's lover and paula isn't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with the affair once disclosed allows the peeling open of the mother daughter relationship which from paula's viewpoint left something to be desired ms bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love she hasn't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn't a bed of roses either br br may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect indeed demand a future of happiness but she is also inescapably vulnerable she's fishing in uncharted emotional waters who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand much less resolve in her sixties she's still a work in progress br br something's gotta give recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited after all it's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich and to insure that no serious psycho social issues were explored keaton's young girlfriend amanda peet daughter of keaton not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old er would be lover never hopped into the sack br br no easy out here anne reid's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views br br kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy br br 9 10
<START> while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's there were more than just bonnie clyde and w d in the gang at various times and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night bonnie's wound was much more severe and never healed right it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i'm being nit picky and it was a tv movie but even without these factual errors in this true story the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a cohesive flowing story br br i'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth
<START> the industry dropped the ball on this the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or ebert and roeper in his book an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens which gave it no chance to be seen some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good this is oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable if you haven't see this movie you should great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films girl interrupted comes to mind if you like that you will like this br br both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school erica is even better in this than in traffic i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records what kind of word are we living in aghhh so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
<START> this film has slipped through the cracks of film history it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as the french connection or the taking of pelham 1 2 3 there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line it's engaging from start to finish and hasn't tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples br br ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as batman and it's a shame his career didn't take off as a result of this project br br gordon parks directs and coming as it does after shaft it at first appears to be a strange choice yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo br br unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states united artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it
<START> as some other comments show this movie might scare you when you're a little child and that is probably all that it is good for br br however if you're older this movie only does one thing suck majorly and thereby i don't mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or s th like that i'm simply talking about the plot if you can call it that br br spoilers ahead br br i don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie but if you graduated from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence when watching this i was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just that stupid br br this includes br br the forming of unite an evil un association br br we are just supposed to believe it's evil is it even evil at all if so why is it evil br br the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo br br there is no necessity to impose this on the people so why the hell no pun intended are they doing it br br inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service br br because there's nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real christian ever does besides saying that stupid prayer so just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved no matter what br br thus rating 1 10
<START> it was so terrible it wasn't fun to watch at all even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator even that's not fun to watch in this movie i say again the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched just girl on couch using a vibrator maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level my advice fast forward to that point watch it rewind the movie watch it again rewind repeat maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen
<START> i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago well i liked parker posey a lot she's a wonderful actress and omar townsend was really cute as her boyfriend he couldn't act but when you look like him who cares but the movie was bad it wasn't funny or cute or much of anything posey kept the movie afloat with her energy but she learned the dewey decimal system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music come on also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a full fledged librarian at the end hair in a bun glasses no sense of humor can we let that stereotype go please worth seeing for posey and townsend but that's about it the tv series was much better
