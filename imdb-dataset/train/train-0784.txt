<START> this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues it's full of emotion and the direction is done well the storyline progresses very quickly but i guess that's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy
<START> valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the 13th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isn't as good as those movies that i have listed about but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the 13th film one of those films was the 1981 canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but it's not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then they're picked off one by one the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material they've got but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however br br out of four
<START> i loved this exiting republic serial the story was one of the best i have ever seen even tough the picture quality was not of the best but ok the fencing in this serial is also a bit bad but not terrible they only should have practised some more as i said the story is great you're just sitting there and waiting to find out who don del oro is the theme music is excellent it's the same guy who maid the music for walt disney's version of zorro who maid the fightin legion music costumes and buildings are very good zorro is really cool and so are the legioners i highly recommend this serial buy it br br i love that reed hadley plays zorro he is funny smart and brave mark 6
<START> offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so called fire starters think stephen king's snore fest of a book with the same name but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac good special effects especially towards the end quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make wilder napalm a unique treat of a film to watch if you can find it that is on a personal note i was fortunate enough to snatch it up so to speak from the two dollar bin at my local video rental store out of
<START> this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i don't like is i can't get it on tape i've tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it
<START> this film isn't just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors busy phillips erika christensen and victor garber are excellent in their roles i highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tear jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
<START> in the same vein as natural born killers another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good david duchovny plays brian kessler an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for i don't know where places where nudity passes for art maybe it really does and i just don't understand it at any rate brian and carrie duchovny and michelle forbes who fits the role flawlessly make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites brian the writer will write the book carrie can take the pictures br br being artistic types brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses and are contacted by early grace and adele corners brad pitt and juliette lewis early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer sees the ad on a bulletin board and decides to leave the state for a while violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation two birds with one stone you know br br the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash without resorting to clichÃ©s or even ending up with caricatures of either type brian and carrie are artsy liberals but while carrie catches on to early and adele brian is fascinated with early's status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where brian shoots early's gun never having fired a gun before he's as fascinated as a little kid while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early broke her of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink early doesn't think women should early and brian are out at the local bar brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy hit him bri it's comin' this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because it's so funny what early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away bloodied and battered but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them and besides that because brian benefited from early's actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele br br clearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes while studying the actions of past murderers brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past br br i am constantly amazed at brad pitt's versatility as an actor consider for example his roles in movies like kalifornia 12 monkeys fight club and ocean's 11 and 12 pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable incidentally i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year but just couldn't get the hair and beard right i even got the hat right which initially i thought would be the hardest part br br it's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter a film that didn't glorify violence at least initially could never be as effective as kalifornia but the movie structures it perfectly the glorification is all embodied in brian's and carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened but their realization and ours is embodied in the real thing which they encounter with early and adele the movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real
<START> this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like rangeela satya and company he pulled a coppola godfather on us what were you thinking rgv anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the old sholay ajay devgan playing heero beeru sholay and ajay new kid on the block playing ajay jay sholay both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first later in the movie now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan in case you haven't been watching bollywood movies the good guys win in the end there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life
<START> pathetic this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to br br the intentions were good great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions but the performance damn i swear in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear action the battle scenes are so bad you wonder are these people for real they could've done more damage just by hugging each other in the slow mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing waving their hands br br only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized but for what the story is so illogical and discontinuous it seems like random situations in chronological order sometimes not even that the dialogs are dumb the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies br br with a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in best case scenario the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store
<START> friz freleng's 'rumours' is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films 'rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military 'rumours' is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don't badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts

<START> this film is like marmite you either love it or you hate it if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values a good plot and great characters you'll hate it if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it br br if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane murderous coke fiend br br the special effects are abysmal at best but really who cares if you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film schizophreniac the whore mangler you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best i'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre br br to sum it up you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced bread 2 i hate marmite
<START> the quote i used for my summary occurs about halfway through the good earth as a captain of a chinese revolutionary army played by philip ahn apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot more of the looters among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines of course the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl o lan for whose portrayal luise rainer now 99 years old won her second consecutive best actress oscar br br the next scene finds o lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under appreciative husband farmer wang lung paul muni setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline br br for a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false accusations misogyny starvation home invasion eating family pets mental retardation infanticide exploited refugees riots civil war summary mass street executions bigamy child beating adultery incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions the good earth is a surprisingly heart warming movie br br my parting thought is in the form of another classic quote from o lan herself while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband wang lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut meat is meat
<START> just picked this up on dvd and watched it again i love the bright colors vs dark imagery not a big beatty fan but this is an excellent popcorn movie pacino is astounding as always and well this movie marked the period where madonna was her absolute sexiest i wish she had stuck with the breathless look for a while longer charlie korsmo's first really big role other than what about bob the makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment the cars wardrobe buildings and even the streetlights et a great tone not to mention the perfect lighting although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying as it tends to blur a little just wish beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel all in all a fun few hours
<START> in one word abysmal i give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women otherwise forget it corman's worst effort bar none ben vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast i cannot believe that this is now going to be on dvd as of 2 15 05 with wild in the streets another retro stinker i woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some scanned the digital channels the premise looked interesting enough because i like viewing b movie sci fi hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks it seemed familiar somehow and with ben vereen in the cast i thought why not what a big mistake it was a horrible start to my day br br only after viewing it i now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly awakened brain i remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14 year old i'm 45 back in the early mid seventies at the sombrero a local art theater that no longer exists the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked acting dreadful story awful cinematography nearly awful music terrible sound horrendous directing a joke if you choose to watch this after my warning remember i told you so br br gass s s s is the perfect title for this film you feel gassed after viewing this putrid movie or maybe that you should be taken to a gas chamber for wasting your brain away i have seen homemade super 8 movies that put this film to shame definitely a new addition to my all time top ten worst films it's up there er down there with tentacles br br ted in gilbert az
<START> an avent garde nightmarish extremely low budget film that has delusions of grandeur hard to sit through i get the message that child abuse is wrong wow big revelation i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this yes that's sarcasm don't watch this film if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender don't watch it if you're the least bit squeamish don't watch it if you care about acting on second thought just don't watch it period br br my grade d br br dvd extras making the movie the premiere interview with kristie bowersock deleted scenes movie stills director's commentary 2 versions of the teaser trailer music video by the azoic a classroom video experiment
<START> this is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the entire movie br br it's a quite intriguing dramatic story with also romance present in it the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good br br of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies produced in the west in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era br br i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better for a movie that is considered a kind of an art house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically not that this is a bad thing it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre br br but oh well this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint br br 8 10
<START> what an amazing film with very little dialogue the whole story is told with glances and body language very involving almost voyeuristic my only gripe is that it has not been released on video in australia and is therefore only available on tv what a waste
<START> isabel allende's magical lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic south american family was vandalized the lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive latin mellifluousness of allende's characters and a plodding scandinavian directorial hand was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion to my disappointment i had not missed a thing none among meryl streep jeremy irons glenn close and vanessa redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director bille august all of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned as if by putting forth as little effort as possible they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets yes the film was art directed within an inch of its life curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing kfc products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970 years before kfc came into being back then it was known by its original name kentucky fried chicken even pardoning that what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military dictatorship in south america in 1970 american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s the house of the spirits should have been the motion picture event of 1993 because it was so club footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented miramax had to market it as an art film as a result it was neither event nor art and for that isabel allende should have pressed charges for rape
<START> epsilon a k a alien visitor is not what i expected this is a no budget australian film with no special effects other than speeded up film and quick scene cuts the female alien who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly accented australian can blip from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the faster humans br br an elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before when an unnamed she came to the planet naked and completely disoriented unable to recognize which star in the sky she came from she meets a man alone camping in the australian outback apparently bewildering him she is here by mistake and gets angry when she is told she is on earth the earthlings are known as consummate despoilers of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe those who breathe the foul air but do nothing about it sticking their heads under the sand like an ostrich in another amusing metaphor earthlings are frogs br br from there it is entirely a film about dialogue as the perplexed man tries to understand she's peculiar psychology and viewpoints even as she calls him unintelligent and quaint the man begins to realize maybe it's humans who are irrational and not thinking straight yet while waiting to be beamed up back home she sees that this human is not entirely faulty in his thinking and even falls in love with him br br the dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting but it is all layered with a heavy handed environmental message and a low budget feel there are only two main actors who blip around various deserted scenes and the evil despoiling humans on the planet are never seen at all the environmental message offers no solutions but paints one or two dire metaphors about what will happen to nature and man if something isn't done the logic also doesn't hang together the rest of the universe has given up on earth yet one space woman caught on earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie what would a battalion of aliens deliberately sent here manage to achieve against pollution and waste
