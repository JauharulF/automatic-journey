<START> slashers well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don't even bother it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game especially for 12 000 000 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
<START> first off anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin's the french connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both the problem with reviewing this film is that a it's a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it objectively difficult and b it's directed by john frankenhimer one of the best american directors ever so i wanted to like it william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city because of his documentary like approach to the action and story frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever i e the manchurian candidate and seconds and with his french connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman's understanding about the original film too it's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again it's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesn't warrant the rest of the film an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer's filmography
<START> has al pacino ever been in a bad movie his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema this is as good a performance as he's ever given pacino is an american olivier and this is a political thriller as good as they get there are no good guys and no bad guys but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it not only is pacino's performance compelling the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language there is murder there are bad people but they come across effectively without crossing the line a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood i don't award many tens this one richly deserves it
<START> citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed the rostov ripper this great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer the film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb jeffrey demunn as the ripper andrei romanovich chikatilo this is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case this a film not to be missed it debuted i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding great film
<START> considering all the teen films like the breakfast club and pretty in pink that are lionized it is surprising that this one is so ignored br br there is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters br br it deals with hero worship how one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was wrong br br the movie is kind of ahead of its' time one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses she says she is doing nothing to need birth control she replies wrongly oral sex
<START> a young solicitor from london arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow while attending her funeral a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life and locals kept pretty quiet about her after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes now can mrs drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about br br often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point but only in doses does it draw upon tag yes from what you can gather i was left a 'little' under whelmed despite really liking it i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature but that's probably itÂ expecting mainly i had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller 'the changeling' when you hear so many good things it's sometimes hard not get caught up with it br br anyhow what the british tv presentation of the woman in black effectively does is bring out a truly old fashion slow burn spine tingling premise driven by its moody locations disquieting atmosphere and first rate performances subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story adapted off susan hill's novel of the same name as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist little seems to happen and can feel drawn out but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black who mostly appears as a background figure it's ultimately creepy she might not appear all that much but when she doesÂ talk about unnerving that also goes for that downbeat conclusion pauline moran who plays the woman in black competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you she's a spirit you don't want to cross paths with yet alone let her see you an accomplished performance by a marvelously moody adrian rawlins as the solicitor arthur kidd does hold it all together in support are solid turns by bernard hepton david daker clare holman and david ryall br br drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn time worn victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear director herbert wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well judged contriving instead of going out to shock us some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won't let go the sound effects are masterfully used by surrounding and disorienting the air rachel portman's harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you br br this rarity made for television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook fest it might not share much new to the sub genre but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse
<START> it was 1 a m in the morning and i had nothing else to do don't judge me please br br we're back in time during the spanish settlements a group have made their way onto an island it doesn't take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobbles up their horse soon they're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods the cg sucks it reminds me of the cg of early console video games the encounters were lame the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit otherwise it's just a middling effort
<START> fay the sister of the notorious nobel prize winning smut poet simon grim still loves henry fool their son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues involving a supremely sad sack collection of government agents terrorists flight attendants and bellhops br br parker posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance including some brilliant physical work with strong contributions by jasmin tabatabai and saffron burrows fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble br br another good score by hartley and thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin where hartley served as a fellow in fall 2004
<START> dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders' the american friend innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit dennis hopper plays a real hit man lara flynn boyle is dangerous the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city like it's predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the cathartic self discovery
<START> i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du japon in paris though i wasn't expecting much from it i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt i'd say i've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end of course it's silly but i couldn't help it the stories are quite different but the worlds pictured are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of palme definitely can't stand the comparison with miyazaki's masterworks even if it's quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it 2 out of 10 a bit harsh i guess it deserves 3 or 4
<START> i can't figure out who greenlighted this thing it has no redeeming qualities none nada zip zilch br br the acting was bad the directing was bad the writing was bad the plot was bad the music was bad the editing was bad well at least the filmmakers were consistent
<START> the most satisfying element about dan in real life is that the relationship between dan steve carell and marie juliette binoche makes sense and is beautifully realistic the casting of oscar winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision she is exceptionally talented intelligent naturally attractive and thank goodness appropriately aged for the part had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson it would have been a disaster br br another wonderful aspect about dan in real life is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the frat pack formula dumb chicks chauvinistic guys and sleazy jokes dan in real life is witty and has fun intelligent laughs throughout whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing the jokes from dan in real life are more natural and clever and involve some thinking on the part of the audience br br my only problem with dan in real life is that the rebellious middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director either way her character is unrealistic and annoying but this is only a minor flaw in the film and does not take away from the story as a whole br br all in all dan in real life is a great film a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed down comedies the quality of the writing directing acting and especially cinematography is excellent it is simply a beautiful light hearted comedy
<START> everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else br br any way i haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course that's a good thing it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying twas beauty who killed the beast war of the worlds scene and more walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema br br however some parts don't fit like in the original lion king weren't timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar in this movie they are not they were fighting the hyenas backstage ther's more the reason being why pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also it's just timon timon timon anybody realise that only timonn's story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks br br but apart from that it s great
<START> with no fault to the actors they all put on great performances the overall story was not very well executed the movie opens with a great zinger a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl's car off the road but then we're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body and the story progresses from there br br while the story does pick up at that point it really goes nowhere after 2 hours i asked myself was there a point to this or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished while it is well acted there's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it
<START> this isn't cinema it isn't talent it isn't informative it isn't scary it isn't entertaining it isn't anything at all br br i got this because my cousin says diablo cool yeah right the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i didn't buy it but rented it instead br br it's shot like a bad soap opera no wait soap operas at least look professional sorta this this looks like it was shot with someone's camcorder it's horrid wretched it sux br br the cinematography is detestable who is this director anyway i don't even care enough to look him up he stinks the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap fest deserved br br 2 6 10 on the b scale br br that registers about a 0 3 10 on the a scale from br br the fiend
<START> i feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad horror film don't waste your time or money on this film the acting is bad the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful nothing about it was good you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap the plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the end it was just so bad i don't know how a film so terrible could be made as i said before i love horror films and i was so let down it was an 18 but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing why is all i can say just don't bother there are far more great horror films out there just don't waste your time life is too short
<START> working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies proud happened to be one of them the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during wwii had some merit however in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii the underlying story is about the ship the crew and their exploits in the war this primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie i commend the men that served on the uss mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured a movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves the navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during wwii
<START> this would have been so much fun to see in a theater back in 1996 there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies br br the dentist is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters maybe the ada launched a campaign against it since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for the marathon man which only has one scene comparable to the many in the dentist br br it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page the movie was shot in 21 days of course post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for the dentist is picture perfect the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically off characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist br br for me the pacing of the movie was just right the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown unlike so many movies of this genre the script is very very tight all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end br br definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests
<START> i'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility the script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the canadian comedy writers' union and that's saying something get out your binoculars if you want but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight ronnie corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish the rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability i'm amazed it lasted past the first episode correction past the auditions all i can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained and it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of â¤100 per episode and just in case anyone thinks i'm commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with english humour i must add that i am indeed english
<START> unreal movie what were these people on a mix of french upstairs downstairs mating horses porn not suggested its pretty full on for a film bestiality with a bit of benny hill music chase scenes thrown in its sounds crazy its even more so to watch spoiler it plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while then a lamb does a runner prompting woman in period dress to run off after it she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect penis attached to a man in a bear rat manky suit i put it like that as its obvious the penis is in charge gets way too much screen time ejaculating for the most of it anyway in a nutshell it turns out she liked a bit of bear rat tadger thats about it the rest is just padding end spoiler a film made to shock offend thus getting talked about any publicity is good publicity i suppose a waste of time really but the main event has to be seen to be believed its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it
