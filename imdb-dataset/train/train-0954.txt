<START> due to budget cuts ethel janowski again played by priscilla alden is released from a mental institution even though she killed six people and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house once there she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food br br holy moly does this movie suck you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film apparently filmed off a tv screen nick millard under his pseudonym nick phillips decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend let's just say that millard's unique style doesn't translate well to video seriously i have made home movies with more production value than this and millard tries to pull a silent night deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage i mean at least the first film tried here we have no music weaker effects if that is at all possible shaky camera work horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up avoid this at all costs
<START> this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin then this would be a pretty good movie every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere someone inhaled the white powder it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer the lesbian stuff didn't bother me i was looking for a movie about art i found a movie about drug use
<START> there is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film br br it was straight up trash at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack burlap of fail the fighting is barely martial the acting is teetering on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but frustrate me i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using yumiko shaku
<START> a unique film one of the best of all time acting script quincy jones' score cinematography editing etc just fantastic as most viewers know this movie is based on truman capote's book about the famous murder of a kansas farm family the clutters by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery i've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film br br the actors are solid across the board but the focus is on the killers dick and perry and the law enforcement team pursuing them scott wilson as dick hickock is amazing cocky twitchy and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming oily and plausible robert blake as perry smith is extraordinary as well lonely and at once empathetic and cold blooded who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it he does and it's brilliant a key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime and these two actors make it work beautifully both had moments in their subsequent careers but these performances are high water marks and that stands for acting period br br the cops are wonderful too leading the investigation is john forsythe but the other three detectives are great as well unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles these are just genuine flatfeet working the case with determination and competence they seem so real i've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity and i've seen most of the crime classics going way back really one of a kind in this respect br br partial spoiler coming this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened but i'm warning for the record br br of course the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks mano a mano this movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film watch dick and perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel unaware the cops have the goods on them but the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions this is some of the best acting you'll ever see think glengarry glen ross without the showboating br br to help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story icb was filmed at the actual clutter house and i've heard the clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel it works these seem like decent simple folk it makes the crime so palpable and sad br br i'll stop here it's not a feel good movie but it is one of the best movies ever made and so unique it's mandatory viewing for every film buff
<START> they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men ok there are lots of myths about ned kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation i mean this is not the robin hood story not the arthurian legends not beowulf not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99 guesswork it's only a couple of lifetimes ago my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged br br so it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story having recently read peter carey's excellent novel the true history of the kelly gang i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein but no the fact is that mick jagger's much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isn't saying a whole lot for it br br glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd i'll give it 3 10 and that's only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous
<START> this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites a movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work also br br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the list br br it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick box their way to save the world br br if you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch a sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is a must th
<START> this documentary was very thorough and exposing and at the same time entertaining which i thought was rather impressive i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its' origin until present day but nonetheless there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film br br i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns' of the sport so to speak too much on individual locations at which to surf and especially too much on individual surfers i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport the ideology of the sport etc it would have been better although this of course was covered i do not think it got as much time as it warranted br br and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring although the video clips and the in depth research is well respected it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers br br furthermore my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing breath taking event that these men are talking about as life changing moments and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it and not the actual footage it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories and then be unable to see them i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything but please do not brag an event up so much and then not show it br br overall a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching not the best documentary due to the above reasons but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out
<START> on the surface this is an above average post war romantic comedy beneath the veneer it is mgm character actor stunt casting at its funniest br br the leads are straightforward but all the secondaries are cast much against type margaret hamilton aka wicked witch of the west edward everett horton professional obsessive compulsive fussbudget and sig ruman the marx brothers' nemesis in night in casablanca and the always wonderful night at the opera playing a well intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together instead of driving them apart as their usual characters would do br br it also pokes fun at many romantic comedy conventions which is another indication that this could be not so much a straight romantic comedy as it is a wry send up of the many post war romantic comedies their 2 dimensional stock characters br br i've seen it only once with interruptions so i can't be positive but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made but is less successful now that viewers see these secondary characters through a completely different lens i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars i thought it was hysterical
<START> city girl meg tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and understandably shaken returns home to her family's rural digs only to be faced with a mystery why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways radiation thriller with barely a nod to ecology has small town residents going berserk which laughably includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and tim matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench the picture is too silly for words wasting tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of some of the cinematography by thomas del ruth is good particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage though he is let down by the scrappy editing and a fairly bathetic finale simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve 1 2 from
<START> reviewed at the world premiere screening sept 9 2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiff br br this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolation br br the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang je films at tiff the feature still life sanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subject br br director jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q a after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself
<START> if people didn't know who barbra streisand was before this is that possible they sure knew who she was after br br this show went on to win 5 emmys stands out as one the best things streisand has ever done br br it's made up of 3 acts br br act i barbra singing standards from room to room filled with musicians including a segment where she is a little girl again all ending with a splendid version of her signature song at the time people br br act ii a musical tour of bergdoff goodman while barbra sings poverty songs it's better than it sounds br br act iii the best part just barbra musicians some great songs like happy days are here again a funny girl medley br br all in all a great part of television history made by one of the greatest performers in the world
<START> i love this movie director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story the power of love against the powers that be however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during wwii or is it the question is never answered one way or the other actually it is never even asked this continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal br br the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers for instance pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss' opera der rosenkavalier about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven the music even has a dreamy quality br br all of the acting is first rate david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter but in my opinion the film's charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film it's a pity that some of conductor 71's scenes were left on the cutting room floor it is also a pity that goring's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishop's wife their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 it's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal br br the movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the u s overdrives its point towards the end but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic
<START> picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public also black in the street and ask him if he is black then walk away the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode more laughter now if you think the premise is funny and the show contains many such types of situation you will enjoy this show for the rest use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny another example of the humor in the show a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all
<START> ok i like b movies i know what b movies are supposed to represent but this is just awful i am amazed it got such a decent overall score the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the mostly marginal splatter effects don't get me wrong gore abounds in this flick but few effects really jumped out at me like the anal probe that was great br br i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder c'mon rent a betacam at least i've seen porn with better production values and better acting as well br br acting sucked but not in the troma or full moon sort of way br br story contrived but thats what you get from films like these very loose br br sets props sucked my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween br br dubbing and dialogue sucked horrible voice acting i shouldn't even call it acting and every other word is s t or f k br br there are tons of good classic and b rated horror splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap
<START> ok so it was written in 1996 before 9 11 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient that's it that's the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters' standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i'm a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads that was a plus it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
<START> i was privileged to have seen some snippets from aardman's original run of this show in the uk it was always fun and always funny none of the charm has been lost in translation it's as fresh as the people interviewed whether some of it is scripted or not as has been rumored is beside the point it's always entertaining br br aardman animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice the single aspect that i probably love most about the show and its concept the hostility between the pandas the porcupines discussing fear of needles the painting ape regulars really grow on you as well such as the horse and donkey teens from maryland most every married couple the parrots the insects and the cats to name a few and child voiced character and i've really come to dig the ferret monday's finally become a day to which to look forward
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clichÃ© lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> frustrated middle aged deputy district attorney george maxwell a fine performance by george e carey who also produced this picture can't stand his naggy frigid wife edith a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy anymore worse yet poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter dishy brunette sheri jackson george has an adulterous fling with lovely enticing and free spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey a frightening robert tessier who sports a head full of hair here from jail director tom laughlin yep the same dude who portrayed billy jack and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity sizzling soft core sex and raw violence moreover they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking wailing rock music and of course hot naked dancing chicks robert o ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings on best of all this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh faced pixie patricia wymer who positively lights up the screen with her sweet bubbly personality and captivating beauty a total trashy treat
<START> i didn't like this film at all first of all i don't know why but everyone here says that clÃ©mence poÃ©sy's play is excellent which in my opinion is absolutely wrong she is not like natasha another appearance another character what's worse she is a very unexperienced actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role she disfigured the heroine completely that was really disgusting to watch her play to my mind that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person unfortunately kutuzov looked like a drunk man who hasn't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye thank's god in this film there're some actors whose play was awesome i suppose that alessio boni coped with his task very well i was pleasantly amazed he is one of the few people who's read the book which is very important for the play in addition i liked plays of our russian actors that was really wonderful to watch them the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense the aim with which leo tolstoy wrote this masterpiece and maybe realize the whole idea of the book 1 from 10
<START> german nut case jÃ¶rg buttgereit apparently has fans but i don't know why and i'm definitely not one of them the only buttgereit film i'd seen previously was nekromantik and i hated every minute of it but shockingly this film is worse der todesking is pointless in the same way as nekromantik but it's a worse film because it's boring in a way that few movies have ever managed it's not far off the blair witch project seriously some people say that this film is 'sick' and 'shocking' but it really isn't the director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is how anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me the film revolves around the theme of suicide and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week yes that means we have a pointless and boring episode for monday a pointless and boring episode for tuesday a pointless and boring episode for wednesday etc etc this film manages to be even more boring than my average week br br der todesking is apparently an 'art' film although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to 'art' each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story but it doesn't we just get a quick little sketch on suicide and it only makes you wonder what the point is the film feels like it should be deep but there's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it buttgereit uses a few evocative images but i'm unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isn't that memorable there's a shot involving a decomposing man's body that features fairly often but that gets old pretty quick and all you're left with is the rest of the film which is unfortunate if i were to struggle for good things to say about this crap all i can think of is this the title sounds cool as i mentioned nekromantik is the only other film i've seen from this amateur director i have copies of schramm and nekromantik 2 and now i'm really in no rush to watch either der todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it 'art' is very much mistaken give it a miss
