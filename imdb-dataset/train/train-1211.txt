<START> this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you're ok it's good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters' negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy
<START> maybe the greatest film ever about jazz br br it is jazz br br the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie br br lester of course is wonderful and out of this world br br jo jones is always a delight see the sound of jazz as well br br if you can find the music it's available on cd br br all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel br br what shadows and light what music what a hat
<START> this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen usually the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them not ice age i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat the hilarious sabertooth squirrel br br ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby set 20 000 years in the past the visuals were great simply beautiful it's one thing to create convincing aninmation it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future
<START> some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles the humanistic angle one where you can feel the raw emotions the terror of being under attack the camaraderie amongst soldiers the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat etc are always movies i find compelling movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film br br this film succeeds on that level as well it speaks of the highest honor and that honor is doing the right thing these 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor unforgettable movie based on the true story
<START> the plot of this film might not be extraordinary but what makes the film really special are its characters and the actors who play them Â of course i won't go into the details of the plot of the movie but i would certainly like to say this Â this film is not just for everyone the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire if you're not alert even for a second you'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan the advertisements on the tankers which i almost missed and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout br br coming to the actors john cusack has played his multi faceted role very efficiently what with him being the co writer and the producer too and he plays his character Â hauser the killer with a heart Â exquisitely cusack's done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb br br however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff i have always been a huge fan of ms duff but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor let's face it the kid's growing but yes so is her talent all those critics who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act will be silent for a while hilary had to play a really complex character Â tough on the outside yet a sweet child on the inside Â and she's done complete justice to it she makes you laugh and she makes you cry Â to cut the long story short 'cause i could go on raving about her for ever she's brilliant marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too especially joan's hysterics are uproarious however i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster br br in general war inc keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot i would highly recommend this movie to all and more so to hilary duff fans p s i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
<START> when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick's other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people don't like kubrick's version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen king's book but in my opinion both kubrick's version the mini series and the book are all great jack nicholson gives an awesome performance if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
<START> carlos mencia continually violently hatefully screaming b ch at women is like screaming n ger at black people except it's worse remember the b word unlike the n word is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence b ch is the last thing women hear before they are raped beaten or murdered this guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman bashing so that he will sound like a hetero and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman hating tee hee hee bet mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for them come on carlos Â do you want women to have the free speech to b ch slap you as loudly and violently and big mouthed as you do or do you think free speech is only for men to crap on women
<START> there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what i've been told the book is enjoyable br br how then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother in law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experience br br this movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isn't even good for being bad
<START> this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman's nashville lumet's network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don't help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly's sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison Â his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don't even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end
<START> the town of royston vasey is a weird but wonderful place the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works and it works very well most people will know others with a touch of some characters but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward the stranger hating owners of the local shop or the pen obsessed pauline who treats dole scum with much contempt that was only a few of the strange inhabitants the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special there are references to many horror films such as the wicker man a more recent addition to the range of works is a film the league of gentlemens apocalypse of which i will not say much but highly recommend all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it
<START> but a lousy film as maltin says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious too serious the plot is silly and slow something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times the film is sooooo dull the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee but this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violent well this has no violence avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep
<START> this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing br br in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable br br having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor
<START> i can see why this film was oscar nominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you don't particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i can't see why director gjon mili only got to direct one film this one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of music br br if you do watch this film if you aren't particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the 5 50 mark where it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise the pace improved quite a bit
<START> when i was a kid of 8 i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to and this was one of them br br it's one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don't make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like seth rogen barf br br this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
<START> i guess when beat street made a national appearance flashdance came at the same time the problem with flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet that was one of the reasons why beat street was better the only movie that could rival beat street seems to be footloose because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings br br the break dance scenes in beat street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick and i loved all of them almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer the flares the head spins the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure four almost everything br br like the warriors beat street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world but in a much less violent way than the former the only major fight scene in beat street was when graffiti artist ramon which in the movie was abbreviated as ramo is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail well although that chase scene ended tragically it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot br br most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip hop culture and rap music a lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hip hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hip hop culture it also was an homage to the death of ramon br br by the way during the dance scene called 'tango tango' i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance
<START> br br i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old i bugged my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased i understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today
<START> note these comments are for people who have seen the movie br br vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag line says lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle br br considering the following br br now i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my assertions and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur br br now i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l e 'technician' since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind dream coma state but the true splice between reality and dream br br it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely 'splice' point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind br br in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is aames actually disfigured and where does he wake up br br if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop culture society br br
<START> do not watch this movie if you loved the classics such as tom wopat john schneider catherine bach sorrell booke james best denver pyle sonny shroyer and ben jones this movie will dissappoint you badly first of all this movie starts out with bo and luke running moonshine for jesse bo and luke would not do that ever on the real series this movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series in the series uncle jesse was honest and law abiding in this movie he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of georgia plus if this was an extension adding on to the dukes of hazzard reunion and the dukes of hazzard in hollywood i have one question how could uncle jesse be making moonshine when he died before the dukes of hazzard in hollywood movie and how is boss hogg alive when he died before the reunion movie in 1997 movie and rosco ran hazzard it seems magical that these characters came back to life when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years if hollywood really wanted to make a good movie they should have brought back james best john schneider tom wopat ben jones and catherine bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting disgraced movie if you want to see good dukes movies either buy the original series or go out to walmart com and buy the dvd set of 2 that includes the reunion and dukes of hazzard in hollywood movies they both star the original cast and are family friendly don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the cd it's written on
<START> magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can't care for others except for john c reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller stahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them br br having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this 188 minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous br br magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn't know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
<START> i was really stunned how much a film that's over 60 years old could impress me it is nearly two hours long there are absolutely no stars in it there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice because you could see that the storms are real this is a relief in a cgi world like ourdays i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it now who wants to talk about 'titanic' anymore it's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects
