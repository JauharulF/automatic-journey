<START> how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character quirks the brown sauce romanticising all that is bad about dublin the attitude of 'ah it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same' plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old cringeworthy stuff the best thing about this movie is farrell and it's a bad when you have to say that well at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock you'll have a better time intermission is a walk outer
<START> what a wonderful movie eligible for so many labels it never gets science fiction film noir with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated cultured audience the kind of english language movie only done in pre 1960 england and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived and never ever done in the usa br br main characters in the man in the white suit 1951 starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic science reference words like polymer and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like long chain molecules and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him br br the man in the white suit 1951 is the opposite of the video game explosion movies which now 2009 dominate world cinema and certainly dominate major usa cinema it's a carefully acted intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors who play educated accomplished people and it's all done with comedy charm pathos and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of br br everybody should see this movie and someday somehow some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it br br it's wonderful
<START> it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd br br i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog some of the talking still remained sub audible if you're from scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one br br peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette br br with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down br br there is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing but this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity br br after about a half hour i gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either
<START> i agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series i did tape all of it but was told by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy like others i purchased and read the deighton series in part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd i'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing he is always amazing
<START> you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers br br i'm sorry but spielberg didn't deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote other oscars for best actor nominations and such that i don't know about but it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so meddlesome while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life this is over the top sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men crowding around miss millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on a cheap slapstick gag the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel as if magically entranced by the choir's singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife sophia's real name oprah backwards spielberg isn't above such cuteness br br it's not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion schindler's list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived
<START> when i was a teen ager seeing this film for the first time i thought it was one of the best movies ever made of course the reason for that is bo derek and her various states of undress in this film however now that i'm older i can honestly say that this film is awful mind you bo derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husband director john derek make sure you see plenty of her but when you take that aspect out of the film it becomes one big dull ride and tarzan well he's all muscular like you think he should be but when he sees jane that's bo of course for the first time he doesn't know what to think this despite the fact that bo is wearing a wet see thru shirt with her breast prominently displayed tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem if you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body then this might fill the ticket if you are looking for a thoughtful entertaining and worth while film go elsewhere almost anywhere else at that
<START> 'what i like about you' is definitely a show that i couldn't wait to see each day amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show 'the amanda show ' she's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth holly is such a like able person and has an out there personality i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times but that's what made the show so great br br i especially loved the show when the character 'vince' came along nick zano is very hot and funny as well as 'gary' wesley jonathan the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm jennie garth allison munn and leslie grossman were all very interesting i especially loved 'lauren' she's the best she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she's gonna do or say next overall the show is really nice but the reason i didn't give it a 10 was because there's no more new episodes and because the episodes could've been longer and more deep
<START> wow where to begin picked this up at big lots for only 2 99 that's three bucks i'll never see again ever and for what i'll tell ya an hour and fifteen minutes of boring boring boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box may the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore not even good gore mind you and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense awful awful awful br br was there any redeeming qualities well on the joe bob briggs scale there were six breasts involved but that's hardly worth my long lost three bucks without those this coulda been on sci fi at say two or three in the morning br br bmoviefreak
<START> this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly just painfully mediocre lacking any real wit or imagination a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the jokes' which are predictable and threadbare are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what shocked' or amused us 30 years ago doesn't work quite the same way now we've seen it all before and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated a major miss
<START> what can be said about mr moore he's the godfather of rap he's the king of the z level blaxploitation flicks and here he is back as his most famous character dolemite can you dig it this movie is one whacked out roller coaster ride of politically incorrect humor trippy kung fu nudity cheese violence and a whole lot of other stuff you'd never find in most modern movies or any movies really haha the stand up routine he gives early on is not to be missed at any rate d2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so dolemite he think he's bad and ain't got no class i'm gon' rock this shotgun up his beep a
<START> born again is a sub standard episode from season one it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly i've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode but the positives end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think it's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge there's even a serious lack of witty mulder scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat if you're into reincarnation maybe this episode is up your alley if you're not then at least you can learn what bradycardia is
<START> i just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just new age pap a great film one that takes its time to develop it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative affecting and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its coincidences can see i was angry at the time that movies like prince of tides and bugsy though i liked the latter were nominated for best picture that year let alone that silence of the lambs won and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay upon revisiting it i think history supports my initial reaction
<START> the jist see something else br br this film was highly rated by gene siskel but after watching it i can't figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isn't entertaining it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do br br this is a difficult movie to take on i suggest you don't accept the challenge
<START> secret sunshine 2007 is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in 2007 and other film festivals jeon do yeon who played the newly widowed shin ae won the best actress trophy at the 60th cannes festival secret sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and jeon do yeon received a best actress nod from asia pacific screen awards in addition this movie won the best film awards in virtually all korean film festivals masterfully written and directed and uniquely photographed secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people lee chang dong director and writer of this movie said in an interview in a vast sense i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense without love we can't talk about hope and salvation lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre this movie is not a movie about religion but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the movie br br the turning point in secret sunshine comes when jun shin ae's son is kidnapped and killed the kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land she must be rich her lie causes much sorrow br br shin ae becomes a church goer and wants to forgive the murderer she decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him jong chan shin ae's guy friend says just forgive in your heart do you have to go to the prison her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her her pastor agrees with what she wants to do that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shin ae's life the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god this sparks anger in her toward god she says how could you forgive the man before i forgive br br she begins to fight against god she looks up to the sky and proclaims i won't lose to you she becomes a snare her heart is a trap and her hands are chains it is more bitter than death she becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital on the day shin ae is discharged from the hospital she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face the daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair the murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped shin ae's son while she cuts shin ae's hair the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly br br it is difficult not to talk about jong chan in the movie jong chan does his best to be by shin ae's side although shin ae doesn't care about him at all he is beside her all the time shin ae leaves church quickly but jong chan who started attending church because of shin ae stays there because he feels peace with god lee chang dong the director of secret sunshine says that jong chan is like milyang secret sunshine the rural city or vice versa he seems to be too secular and frivolous but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her milyang is like him mr lee adds someone joked that jong chan could be an angel i think that he could be the angel who knows we can't say for sure that there is no angel if there is a person like jong chan who forever accompanies his lover's twists and turns we can defend ourselves against the overpowered the life of shin ae is full of meaninglessness her husband died after he cheated on her and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong wayÂand that makes her crazy literally it is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness does she still have hope in her life can she find meaning in her life the final scene gives us hope shin ae tries to cut her hair by herself we walk our life's journey by ourselves she however realizes that it is hard to do it by herself and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves we see jong chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair that's her hope she has jong chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is as i mentioned earlier jong chan is like an angel for her if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives br br secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea it is like da vinci code while da vinci code helps us discuss the early church history secret sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable with a shallow interpretation of the movie people misunderstand christianity and its theology with a deeper interpretation this movie will help us see beneath the surface some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine and lee chang dong responds by saying they were already anti christ before they watched this movie secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shin ae's life
<START> i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it 10 10
<START> i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade as much as the film is g rated it's pure lynch in style pacing and tone the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power br br the cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a lynch film and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking it's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evil br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role br br with this film david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'blue velvet' and 'the elephant man' critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'twin peaks fire walk with me' and 'lost highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive' considering the high praise it's received and the oscar nomination for lynch br br 'straight story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i've ever seen it's a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers i would highly recommend it
<START> unlike some comments mine is positive this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends some you like some you don't a few are related mother daughter son their stories are not one smooth happy with everyone and everything type of life much like real life some story lines do not evolve they just happen but like true families and good friends they stick together the wanna be parents who are buying a baby are such a holes you are happy for the ending poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself her mom her son and trying to keep all their lives together this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day month to month overall this is a good story and a great movie
<START> in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got there br br the people are going from one point to another point with really no point if there was one it was very dull there was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to them br br all together the movie was pretty boring br br i give it a 3 10 br br i like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
<START> i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of church produced films i left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions br br the film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith it's not a true biopic because there's no real coherent narrative most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in sloooow motion what a great just folks kind of guy that joseph was huh look at him out there beating rugs for his wife emma well howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives no mention whatsoever is made of polygamy a glaring omission br br and it is in such omissions where the film falters it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting tarred and feathered why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him the film's climax is of course joseph and hyrum's trek to carthage jail riding past a veritable united nations of faces looking out from nauvoo's doorways but no mention is ever made about why nothing about smith suppressing the nauvoo expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy the audience is left to wonder or to assume it's just more baseless persecution of the church no mention of joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the nauvoo militia br br of course i certainly did not expect this church produced film to present the joseph of richard bushman's recent biography rough stone rolling but i was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented br br and worse what substance that was presented was often inaccurate two examples jumped out at me first the translation of the book of mormon the film shows joseph reading right off the golden plates in their two ring binder which plates in reality were hidden far from the site it's well known that joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat peering at the seer stone in there the second inaccuracy occurs at carthage jail where the mob storms the cell the history of the church reports that joseph had a six shooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the masonic signal of distress as reported in times seasons br br maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the heart tugging mood the filmmakers had created but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself in fact the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood he was far from that joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed br br see the film but know going in that's it's cotton candy then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of bushman's biography of smith rough stone rolling br br ps church produced films have no credits but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces rick macy is excellent as joseph smith sr and bruce newbold beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ here plays the cranky methodist minister who failed to show christian love to a young seeker after truth
<START> i admit to liking a lot of the so called frat pack movies no matter how bad they are i can find something to like about ben stiller or owen wilson or vince vaughn or will ferrell or jack black but envy just left me about as cold as the white horse that ben disposed of this time it's ben and jack black as a couple of nutty neighbors one of whom black discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other stiller writhes in envy that's supposedly the plot but then it veers off in other directions that don't really make much sense br br i guess the 'vapoorize' thing is sort of amusing at first the problem is they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture black has a license plate that reads 'caca king' and it gets fairly tiresome but even ben and jack are used poorly the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down the two best performances by far are rachel weisz and chris walken walken's neo hippie dippie guy is so offbeat and so well modulated a performance that it really never suggests any of walken's other familiar nutcase characters it's completely unique yet comes across as unmistakably walken and weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about even with limited screen time she still dominates every scene she's in br br the whole crux of the so called drama is that ben in a jealous drunken stupor accidentally shoots jack's prize white stallion and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead but the plot twist isn't believable because there's nothing about jack's character to indicate that he would do such a thing he plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void you discount it completely it's all filler and what's the point of the out of control merry go round except that barry levinson wants us to know that he's seen strangers on a train the screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed someone with levinson's track record should know better maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear oh wait they already have
