<START> there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship stuff he dare not dream about br br as doctor edward morbius pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter anne francis they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell br br the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin the machinery they left behind is still functioning br br maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion br br i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956 the terms would change we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek br br we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change br br the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play god br br you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot this mechanical marvel put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny br br robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b demille br br classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction br br my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with br br never miss this one whenever it's broadcast
<START> this unpleasant film has little to recommend it dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture br br but no motivations are either murky or trite most of the acting is sub par the script creates needless confusion and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting br br it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film
<START> so mary and rhoda have aged who hasn't i was a teen when mary premiered and a young adult when it left the air yes it was great to see mary and rho together and yes maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about old people isn't this typical of the mentality of present day hollywood tv and film bean counters this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s
<START> if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium br br unfortunately the butcher brothers haven't grasped this yet br br this film sucks unlike the majority of its characters who if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you preference stringing up the plentiful supply of 'no one knows where i am' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger past their isolated door br br the only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy br br forced to up sticks as opposed stakes on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses they really are none too bright if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy br br why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother i am not sure it added zero to the plot which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all br br one was never told why the parents had died unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again it was for the viewer to write their own reason br br the only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like pugsley from the adams family indeed he was way too rounded having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a weight watchers' class in to a very bad horror film oh heavens he had never mind dear have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre
<START> i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting it was raw and honest and felt as if i was really watching the real people not actors it's great entertainment it also painted the people as human on our level not below us it is a very good film
<START> br br i have seen this movie many times at least a dozen but unfortunatly not recently however etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney killer mears knows that he is to be executed and it's getting close to the moment of truth he dances and cries and laughs he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead past or present it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney yes andy hardy was and is a actor of great genius however i kept it my opinion to myself for years thinking surely i must be alone in this viewpoint about 15 years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television i chanced to read the old q a section of the los angeles times the question was posed to lawrence olivier and the question was mr olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors his answer was peter finch and mickey rooney i was stunned but not surprised i immediatly flashed back to his killer mears and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him and now having my view supported by another whos work i admired later of course there was bill and many other great moments with mikey rooney this film the last mile should be seen by all acting students i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr rooney in it will never leave me if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do i would be interested in hearing from you for this picture etched in my heart alone i gave it a 10 just on the face of his performance
<START> blazing saddles it's a fight between two estranged brothers dennis quaid and arliss howard both of whom can ignite fires mentally they square off over childhood differences with dippy love interest debra winger caught in the middle director glenn gordon caron the tv whiz kid behind moonlighting smothers the darkly textured comedy in vince gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities these aren't even characters they're plot functions barely released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good winger is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly perplexed 1 2 from
<START> this movie makes peter an elf in robin hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not robin hood costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter this movie makes wendy a babbling idiot and poor captain hook a total clown and of course as every disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head they made one of the lost boys that one the only character that has not been disgraced in this film is tink the only star is for her br br the story itself then the darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it also the famous nursery scene between peter pan and wendy is a stunning piece of there are no thimbles and no acorns one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one it's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me br br ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal so know now if you haven't known it before this disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story which is not really a children's story but just a great great story br br this just annoys me to no end
<START> loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can i say it was a total mess the directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast forward slow mo nonsense it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson smashing pumpkins placebo music video whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi's death was just stupidly funny it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more no explanations were given whatsoever i mean i knew what was happening only as i'd read the story but for people who hadn't it's even more confusing as at times even i didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do it was going on an insane tangent the whole time br br god i really wanted to like this film as i'm a huge fan of barker's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell i even enjoyed some of kitamura's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish i didn't care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing gutted
<START> i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain why br br when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse gathers in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi shimizu pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film s valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour Â by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like this br br person walks into house br br something flashes by the camera and or a strange sound is heard br br person goes to investigate br br sound starts to get loud br br person sees a ghost br br loud scream and or cat screech br br cut to black br br before the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never proved wrong br br the film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled i have no problem with non linear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason i haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander 2 and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone br br obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made 15 million its first weekend the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge
<START> stack should have received the academy award for this performance period its a crime that he did not amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character br br dorothy malone did earn a well deserved academy award for her performance in fact all of the acting in this film is excellent br br the plot begins with a taxi ride then an airplane ride then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout you will be entertained br br however this is only a blatant soap opera one dimensional 100 percent soaper you might call it the ultimate soaper because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material excellently acted well directed but strictly within its soap genre i wouldn't even call it a melodrama such as mildred pierce or imitation of life while not denying the great entertainment value of this film you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter
<START> i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 and at the time it shocked me i had seen a violent movie before but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence this movie not only shows this but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful crash tried to show how racism was bad and crash actually had a built in anti asian bias and to come at it from a morally superior position grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash especially when you compare the endings the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too there's no suitable ending no matter how good bad you are there is no ending of a chapter to begin another
<START> as an amateur historian of ww2 nazi germany i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd i missed it when it was first on in 2003 i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies a better job could've been done portraying the charming hitler i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices not so much for their acting but for their appearances peter stormare doesn't look much like rohm why didn't they make babson as hess wear a wig and my biggest complaint so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes why didn't they make carlyle wear blue contacts on the plus side i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good again as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done

<START> it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film whereas patton lust for glory' producer frank mccarthy's earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments like a previous reviewer i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other br br one difference between the two films is that patton' is more focused concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war whereas macarthur' covers not only this war but also its subject's role in the korean war as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude br br the main difference however lies in the way the two leaders are played gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c scott dominated patton' whereas scott had another major star karl malden playing opposite him as general bradley none of the other actors in macarthur' are household names at least for their film work scott of course portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery tempered a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race not just with the enemy i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton but that is not how he appears in this film peck's macarthur is of a more reflective thoughtful bent comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films at times he even seems to be a man of the political left much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid up member of cnd and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi socialist air to them in an attempt to show something of macarthur's gift for inspiring leadership peck makes him a fine speaker but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart it is as if atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird' had put on a general's uniform br br whereas scott attempted a warts and all' portrait of patton the criticism has been made that macarthur' attempts to gloss over some of its subject's less attractive qualities i think that this criticism is a fair one particularly as far as the korean war is concerned the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp many historians of course feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated even during the korean scenes peck's macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real life original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters truman 's remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday' was said about eisenhower but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur's approach to international diplomacy perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of macarthur's warts reflects the period in which it was made the late seventies after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate was a difficult time for america and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur something should have been shown of his early life which is not covered at all the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur's father himself a military hero i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur's clash with truman with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches br br it would be wrong however to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether although i may not have agreed with peck's interpretation of the main role there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness the film as a whole is a good example of a solid workmanlike biopic thoughtful and informative it is a good film but one that could have been a better one 7 10 br br on a pedantic note the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war the pre war boundary was the 38th parallel also i think that macarthur was referring to the tocsin' of war war may be toxic but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin
<START> the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances br br however br br the script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichÃ©s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was br br very disappointing
<START> i kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace but i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north it is definitely not montana north and never will be americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason why stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations even in jest i would never refer to the usa as 'alberta south' walt would never put us down so why start now other than that the film was pretty goofy better luck next time
<START> as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale this film with the new bond starring in it was shown from director roger michell notting hill i almost turned it off for being a bit boring but i'm glad i stuck with it basically may anne reid is a single mother of helen anna wilson jones who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend darren daniel craig of course after knowing each other only a few days may and darren have a secret affair and at her age with a 30 something and the new bond anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out when she does darren gets less hassle than may in fact helen asks her permission to hit her also starring peter vaughan as toots danira govich as au pair harry michell as harry rosie michell as rosie and johnny english's oliver ford davies as bruce very good
