<START> the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget halestorm entertainment has had to work with all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film
<START> absolutely the very first film that scared me to death i happened catch it when my older brother r i p was watching it it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested shortly after my folks bought a color set and as luck would have it the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday br br i had forgotten most of the plot but it did not take long to catch up and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space but you could not hear it or see it and once it got hold of you it was too late even now after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine a true classic and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation br br long live the blob
<START> if the scale went negative i would be happier seeing sushmita sen was nice and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story the choice of angles choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story oh if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head first the film could have been made twice at 1 25 hours and been pretty good kinda like seven samurai but the director and writer didn't go that direction even if the townsfolk finally find their backbone and want to help this movie fails on so many levels editing writing photography angles style lighting script name any aspect of this film it was bad probably the food from the caterer was bad too i have never in 6 years of watching indian bollywood movies seen something this badly made
<START> an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this twisting and turning i speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear br br the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks br br and indeed it does
<START> i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia based on certain relics that are found in both places certain types of ancient sea going vessels that we know they had available analysis of ocean and wind currents and the knowledge that the incas did in fact travel in some undetermined amount at sea br br in order to test his hypothesis heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time and set out from lima peru's capital to try to reach the islands of polynesia some 5 000 miles away br br his theory like so much about ancient history is impossible to prove with 100 certainty but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100 day expedition but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released
<START> i've watched this movie a number of times and found it to be very good this movie is also known as castle of terror coffin of terror and dance macabre barbara steele is her usual beautiful creepy self george riviere the male lead does a good job with his role the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere and there is a good deal of tension throughout the camera angles are good and the acting for the most part isn't bad this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening i have the dvd uncut version which is far superior to the edited tv version grab some popcorn turn out the lights settle back and enjoy john r tracy
<START> the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin and gross an obese lawyer drives over the gypsy woman and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone ok gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weight losing gone bad nope except stephen king thinks so and michael mcdowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness hey i can only say well look at the mirror
<START> the plot was very thin although the idea of naked sexy man eating sirens is a good one br br the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie splatter lesbian mouth licking shots in between br br the characters were wooden and one dimensional br br the ending made no sense br br considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them br br brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush naturally and of course the lesbian moments i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the 'shower scene' br br the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely br br if i had been watching this alone and aged 15 i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes with 1 hand of the remote control then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza
<START> why did this movie fail commercially it's got a sharp script by ron shelton and great performances by kurt russell and especially robin williams in a brilliant manic nerd turn that's different from any of his other work a great renter
<START> i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film sadly that's about all i got the story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling the sexism of the film was blatant women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both though this was couched as a post feminist choice worse still was the racism the shrill jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty tormenting the class geek we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen
<START> strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didn't like this one at all it's awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol it's also filled with overused clichÃ©s of characters and situations i don't get it why people liked it poetry hope nope 'mam didn't see anything like that all in all it's empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
<START> okay this movie f ck in' rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun it's hilarious and the behind the scenes featurette proves it you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot the director on the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're yeah right man they are totally walking in place it's so funny
<START> well maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots but even a few months before was timely enough my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground it just goes to show the state of race relations in america the plot has white mack kevin kline and african american simon danny glover becoming friends after simon saves mack's life in the black ghetto meanwhile movie producer davis steve martin in a serious role thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool until he gets shot there's also some existentialism in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they aren't living as they really want br br it seems that crash has somewhat renewed people's interest in race relations but this one came out much earlier maybe we'll never be able to have stable race relations in this country but either way grand canyon is a great movie it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor also starring mary mcdonnell mary louise parker and alfre woodard
<START> this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them we know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car and that is what happens now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap now how is he going to get out of it that's what you must discover by yourself and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river we also know when he is going to be wounded they did not know what bullet proof jackets were in those days it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq but what is the meaning of such a film this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and that's why i've seen it i regret the time i lost to see this 1 out of 10 because they don't have a lower grade
<START> this is a lovely spirit restoring movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
<START> this was one of the best shows ever made for tv full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns compulsive viewing i was lucky i saw this in the uk they might have got the episode order wrong i can't remember but it at least was on at a regular time every week my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally br br after the pilot we knew this was something special we missed a couple of episodes and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol br br great casting superb acting gary cole was absolutely brilliant better even than his role as custer lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid and paige turco was at her best too since party of five and nick searcy of course as the sheriff's long suffering sidekick br br yes there were some confusing and perplexing bits which i presume would have been explained later and no doubt would have been in a later series that made the ending weak and you could tell they'd killed it made us go what why did they do that with one of the best shows ever shoot the exec
<START> this man is nothing short of amazing you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end he was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain i watch this video every time i am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like jonny did even with his unbearable pain my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner as i visited england 2 times during his life and would have been able to say i'd met him it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free rest in peace dear jonny you deserve it
<START> aka the bloodsucker leads the dance br br lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me br br gothic lesbians get invited to a count's island castle for the weekend one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around br br it's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit go figure sic br br dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo this is one snoozer br br pretty boring 2 out of 10
<START> this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever and believe me that's hard to achieve especially when you're competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies i'm not a cof fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie a really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for it's crappiness watch it when you're in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs
