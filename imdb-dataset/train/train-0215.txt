<START> what can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears i am rarely this unsatisfied with a b horror flick but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he she should seem almost god like like nothing can stop their maniacal rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he's far too stupid to be dangerous all in all a total waste of film
<START> in the early to mid 1970's clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes claiming to have spent months preparing for the book engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire when all of this turned out to be false irving was accused of perjury spent several years behind bars although always admitting his findings were accurate flash forward to 20001 several months prior to september 11th a book entitled 'forbidden love' published in the u s as 'honor lost love and death in modern day jordan' by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri a woman from jordan who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia due to the fact that dalia being from a devout muslim background was dating a christian man it like irving's biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax australian film maker anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie s over the time frame of 104 minutes the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth or is she just a compulsive liar with an agenda vendetta of her own interview footage with those who know knew her including an ex husband her publisher and others tell their side of the story this is a toothsome well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties not rated but contains pervasive bad language a re enactment of the grisly murder scene played over a few times but nothing nearly as graphic disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic such as saw part 84 not a good choice for the little ones
<START> protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film
<START> some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from pou soi cheang isn't really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hard edged action is your thing br br edison chen plays pang a cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge sam lee is wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeÂuntil he meets yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse br br a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from chen and lee as well as newcomer pei pei as pang's love interest dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence think along the lines of chan wook park's vengeance trilogy stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang br br of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments dog bite dog crosses it in a laughably over dramatic final scene pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on a now dead yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies br br whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of hong kong excess with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals it's still worth seeking out
<START> this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike br br drew barrymore is at her best in this movie as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical sports crazed sweetheart the comedy in this movie is great there were several laugh out loud moments br br their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day instead of leaving he helps take care of her helping her change into pajama's then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was 'very lady like no chunks ' everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on 'the curse of bambino' br br everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant br br eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red sox yankee game i knew i would be going stag' after the party ben tells her it was 'the best night of his life' shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him it was the best game ever ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life he says well that was a few minutes ago br br so they separate for a while he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't it would 'remind him too much of what he gave up for them' lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love lindsay they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st louis and it is a happy ending all around 2 thumbs up
<START> a great storyline with a message joan plowright is superb as phoebe mike kopsa is hilarious as coach and richard de klerk plays the role of carmine superbly mischa barton as frankie puts in a good performance and ingrid as hazel plays her first lead extremely well this film is superbly directed by jo beth williams the editing is first rate
<START> what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe we are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini plots br br the film pilfers themes from science philosophy theology and politics minces them together without any regard for accuracy and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question the film makers would like to point their finger at br br it is riddled errors and logical non sequiturs how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo scientific spirituality and mysticism it's like saying 'two plus two equals four therefore i can move objects with my mind' br br there is nothing original in this film and almost nothing that is accurate any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy handed editing intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on
<START> hollywood now has officially gone too far and i really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines in spite of the good box office returns if you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next stop stop making our tv shows into these repellent stupid money grubbing waste of time movies that suck by doing so you are proving one thing hollywood is out of ideas and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust what's next you guys gonna go ruin the bionic man br br the film is just plain wrong and manages to get the most stupid simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting or ignoring that tom wopat john schneider's bo luke duke were reformed moonshiners they had been busted learned their lesson gone straight and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows drive like steve mcqueen denver pyle's uncle jessie was also the moral center of the family always insisting that the boys do good even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done they always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivetÃ© about them that was quite appealing we wanted to be more like them than we were sorta my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off which was apparently too moral for this film br br by transforming the duke family into a pack of leering wisecracking criminally minded redneck baiting misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the dukes were are the duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys i wanted to punch them both in the nose they seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up there should be no marijuana use no gawking at buxom nubile coeds their breasts no shenanigans involving the brothers in da hood all of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies the problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show imho shouldn't be seeing this movie either and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers director producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money which is exactly how i feel what were they thinking br br and boy did they ever get daisy wrong jessica simpson all dolled up like a pamela anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her printing them up pinning them to the wall in a restroom she is hardly in the film at all which is the movie's only saving grace and the ten minutes or so they used her was still excessive catherine bach's daisy may have had the same kind of shorts and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her but the daisy she played was a person the pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it she remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home and most importantly she was a sweet caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went ga ga over her br br by contrast jessica simpson appears phony contrived made up costumed posed aloof bored out of place and i don't think she even looks that great in the outfit she doesn't look like a person but a plot device conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent ms simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened whatever the joke was she isn't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for t a if that's all she wants from her career executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least because this effort was just pathetic br br the bottom line is skip it for the cost of two tickets and a slurpee to go you can pick up one of warner bros excellent box set collections of the original shows on dvd and the entire family can watch them together that was why it worked the only real purpose i can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at guantanamo bay twenty minutes of this they'll be singing a choir br br 1 10 and i mean it and stay the hell away from the bionic man you schnooks
<START> an utterly beautiful film one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do in thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time by the '90's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema Â when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again br br idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne after escaping with a little thief played by sabu ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love Â along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for sabu and love not only conquers but annihilates everything the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action Â but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later anyway if i'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall's suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend Â in fact the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and casablanca and then died john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered br br there's a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer one of my top 10 film favourites i can't recommend this too much Â may it be shown to the end of time
<START> picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market was pretty excited br br i found it fascinating for about 15 min then just repetitive and dull br br it is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playing br br the skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort of poorly written monty python on acid i spent more time looking at the late 60's england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits br br this movie is a good reminder that times really change and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly good song but it has now been played to death by this dvd
<START> the first movie is pretty good this one is pretty bad br br recycles a lot of footage including the opening credits and end title from criminally insane the new footage shot on video really sticks out as poorly done scenes lack proper lighting the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible there's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on br br like all bad sequels it basically just repeats the story of the first one ethel kills everybody who shares her living space often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants br br at least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one which also includes the same director's film satan's black wedding too bad it doesn't include the death nurse movies though
<START> frequently voted china's greatest film ever by chinese critics as well as chinese film enthusiasts from the outside and frankly i don't get it at all what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable blandly directed and acted with a complete shrew for a protagonist wei wei don't laugh is that shrew a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband yu shi for the past several years it is post wwii and they live with the husband's teenage sister hongmei zhang in a dilapidated home with not much money the man had been wealthy when they married along comes the husband's old best friend wei li who also used to be the wife's boyfriend when they were teens she considers running away from her husband with this man while the husband pretty much remains oblivious thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend that's the set up and it doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect it to i've actually seen the remake directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian it runs a half hour longer and is actually kind of dull too but at least it was pretty this supposed classic is pretty intolerable
<START> the title is onomatopoeic the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails it is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump cannot have the misery of those people is illustrated by the passing streetcar which represents the relatively unobtainable rich life of the middle class the pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching this was kurosawa's first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking hues colours seen only in dreams the movie is surreal and surpassing in beauty the compassion for humanity is the underling force but as always kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film it is a masterwork by a genius of cinema
<START> the first half of this version was the best i've seen and i think i've seen every version of jane eyre ever made the development of jane's childhood and character were exceptional then it was as though someone said uh oh this is running too long and hacked the rest of the story to shreds the major scenes when included at all are glossed over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end dashed it
<START> lets start off by saying that jawani diwani is just a pathetic movie i agree with the last person who said i missed the joyride lol br br the jokes were just terrible performances were average something went terribly wrong with the film emraan totally deserved something better all celina jaitley did was expose hrishitta bhatt was ok emraan hashmi was ok too br br mann emraan hashmi is a desperate guy who wants to become famous therefore he uses radha and pretends he loves her only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous since the father obeys everything his daughter says one day mann and his friends go to goa to have some fun there he meets roma celina jaitley and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her bla bla bla br br then that night roma cannot open the door to her room and mann decides to help her seeing that he cannot as well roma goes to ask for help while she is gone mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed bla bla bla roma comes in and they have a one night stand however in that one night stand roma falls in love with him that morning they spot the underworld don mahesh who sees it all the don loves roma and couldn't stand what he saw he orders them to get married and being frightened mann obeys the order and merry's roma then their marriage news ends up in the newspaper mann is later finds out that he loves roma after they do a music video together he is now trapped between love and fame bla bla bla br br the movie is horrible the songs sini ne sini ne is fantastic the remix version is even better dil diwana is also great the title track is also awesome guys avoid watching this movie
<START> i saw a trailer for this on afro promo the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african americans it looked like what it is a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay it would seem that redd foxx's rf wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles br br so as rf arrives norman wearing nothing but powder blue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge it was just to the point where i wrote why won't he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue eyed swirl hairdoed garson norman's white live in lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dreamÂ garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 l a he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch br br norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit garson goes to stay with waylon flowers and madam answers the phone when norman calls br br so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico while he is on the phone garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions he realizes that his son is gay br br his first impulse is i'll kill him i'll kill him then rf goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality this it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all br br rf then hires audrey a six foot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody br br then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night he commiserates over the loss of rf's wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested at a luau they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose once more mouths were agape br br so it seems that wouldn't ya just know it rf and garson have a wonderful evening together you see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highly effeminate entertainment of mega queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer it's really just that simple this still does not prevent rf from yelling rape when garson wakes him from a bad dream it ends less predictably than you'd think br br there was so much that was just off what is the basis of norman and garson 's relationship they don't seem to have any rapport and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends garson or talks about their relationship there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality Âand sitting right down on the park bench to read them i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends br br other than that it's kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another and because of the whole naivetÃ© of this thing the extreme stereotypes and message laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert them br br hey check out cinema de merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in you can find the url in my email address above
<START> love at the top the utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film le mouton enrage which means i think the rabid sheep is such an original movie the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding this film was far ahead of its time even by today's highest standards it accomplishes things that seem rich and new filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique comedy mystery love sex and satire into one wholly original mix leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable the cast is splendid ditto the writing and theme but it's deville's delicious tone keeping you constantly off balance but enrapt that pushes this lost film to a very high level indeed the written interview with the director on the special features section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time
<START> renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horror drama film 19th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of non criminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably bad br br after the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the 19th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they don't do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didn't help out his actors much br br jonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth it's also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an in demand street whore since she can't act to save her life though her song during the final credits isn't so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to i'll take mee clothes off for a shillin' as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laugh out loud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion any emotion br br there's only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy dalton's performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
<START> i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmo's moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don't know what a cosmo's moon is
<START> unremittingly bleak and depressing the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecq's controversial novel of the same name like many french films its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow or should that be slowly painful while this is an excellent and challenging film it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the 'right' mood to see it
