<START> this movie was extremely funny i would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list i know this cast of characters they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs redd foxx always a clown of comedy pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out dennis dugan crazy funny man miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience love lust strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer episode from seinfeld the parents have there jaw dropping moment fun over fun it is screaming bring me back
<START> first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middle east led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george i'm going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the jade scorpion hollywood ending i've felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit antiquated i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow aarp card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of 20 somethings and 30 somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like in many instances the throw aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line br br thematically woody was traipsing familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of oedipus wrecks new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginning br br even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woody proxy but her character was far from the nebbish that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth branaugh attempted in celebrity instead of archetypal ticks and quirks sondra's nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non sequiturs since we are all in on the joke we can't help but laugh but the laughs don't come from recognizing the woody nebbish but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell branaugh cusack or even mia farrow before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we don't find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a woody's voice suddenly emerges from someone else' face br br as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more center stage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed dobel sage character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment br br but what about jackman what about ian swearengen mcshane i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked mcshane's short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from 50 years ago class echoes from purple rose of cairo br br so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since 1994's bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty aphrodite less caustic than deconstructing harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century
<START> devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the dpp 'video nasty' list but it really needn't have been many films on the list where there for god and dpp only known reasons and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch there isn't a lot here that warrants banning which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list' the plot actually gives the film a decent base or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil hence the title the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest it's a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z venus in furs faceless and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i've seen everything on the dpp's list just two more to go and i'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it saw it but if you're not on the lookout for nasties there really is no reason to bother with this one
<START> i can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at it br br i agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good br br despite it wasn't a re enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch
<START> even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality like most parents he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to norman's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish redd foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended
<START> in a word excellent this is the movie go and see it the director ron howard i mean the director ron howard did a fantastic job as he usually does an incredible attention to detail vivid colors and decorations breathtaking whoville atmosphere astonishing variety of costumes wait there's more to it than that the story is very good too there's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers jim carrey is top notch he is probably the best grinch possible the girl taylor momsen is real good i'm sure she has some great future the dog is cool all in all it's a very high quality christmas fairy tale if you like fairy tales it's for you if you like christmas it's for you br br reading some other reviews here get a life it hurts me every time to see people out there who well got their hearts two sizes too small
<START> flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i've ever seen up to now br br it's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isn't really trying in this he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more br br the co stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters br br the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers shadow man attack force the screenplay co written by seagal himself is laughably inept br br according to imdb 12m was spent on this boring load of old tosh if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent br br flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder which has to be better than this tripe br br this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever give it a miss 1 2 out of
<START> henry sala's nightmare weekend is a rotten piece of sludge from troma this is a juvenile sloppy and stupid low budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion the professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies nightmare weekend is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore not to mention a laughable musical score the acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me avoid it like the plague 1 out of 10
<START> if you find yourself in need of an escape something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world domino will satisfy that need this is entertainment after all the plot keeps your brain in motion one of those movies like usual suspects where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out i wondered about domino harvey herself how her life became of interest to hollywood as for the acting lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume and granted mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often but here despite the violence he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people
<START> spoilers i loved the later episodes from college and on but i wish i could get the last season on dvd unfortunately the latest i could get is the first college season still the teenage years were sweet although they focused a lot on magic they also made her into a character that teens could relate to deeling with the stuggles of teens and children in divorced families this show was very innocent they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs but they did deel with pressure to fit in i loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her aunts to let go as she left the nest the older episodes were cute but it was just so much better to see her as well not really a teenage witch anymore but an adult witch i loved roxy and mortgan they were so talented in the earlier episodes the aunts were great actresses but they were so strict kind and loving but they treated her like a young child in some ways but not in every way i mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic i mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once that was what i liked about the college episodes she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything that was annoying not to put down hilda and zelda melissa joan hard is beautiful and was perfect for the sabrina with her perky personality i liked the last episode where she ran off the marry harvey but as somebody else said it would have been nice to see what happened after i mean i believe it was obvious they were getting married where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress but i would have liked to have seen it i supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house but they already graduated college sabrina had great job for a magazine and i think harvey had a good job because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end but they never say what he does as a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his dad when sabrian moved into the house that season they never really explain how it happened actually there is a lot the show does not explain but i supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery prior to sabrina and her friends moving into the house they show hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with zelda turning into a child hilda comes back in the last episode and zelda is there in some other form but beth is not on the episode but they do not show zelda's husband or what happened like did they have children maybe they didn't want too much going on in one episode i also liked hart's sister who played her spoiled cousin she was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up i cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air i still love the reruns also i don't know if anybody noticed this but in the earlier episodes the town was called westbridbe a made up town i believe which was supposed to be close to salem but in the later episodes they don't mention the name of the town being caled westbridge and i think they call it boston unless that is just where she worked also i wanted to add i found the episode wild wild sabrina where she is taught about the importance of rules to be insulting she was 18 and too old to be grounded i would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 and i think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did they need to learn the consequences on their own i think at 18 they know rules are important
<START> i am so appalled by this documentary i am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way puertoricans were portrayed this documentary was not about the culture of puertoricans it was about the culture of nuyoricans puertoricans and nuyoricans are two different cultures very different cultures and should not be generalized to the puerto rican population rosie before you make a documentary you need to do the research you also need to check and make sure your sources are credible puerto ricans are not all loud and they do have class which is one thing the documentary lacked to show when i saw rosie and jimmie on the view and rosie on martha stewart i was very excited about watching i even made sure to let my parents know since they love puerto rico so much after the first five minutes i could not believe how the documentary bashed the us and made puerto ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs you need to go and visit puerto rico and you will see that puerto rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50 of the population is in poverty puerto rico has colleges and well known universities roads cars shopping centers malls the largest kmart and jcpenney's i've ever seen restaurants theaters beaches hotels ritz hilton etc casinos churches agriculture auto expresso and restaurants just to name a few poverty not 50 of the population is puerto rican culture is about family music food celebrating and trying to move forward not backward oh and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where no that is not a puerto rican thing that is a ghetto thing we are not bastards parents of puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about puerto rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what puerto rico is all about they will see its beauty people and culture please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity oh and please don't tell your american friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the puertorican people look ignorant br br yes i am born and raised puerto rican from the island just so you know
<START> home room came as a total surprise not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates who are the innocent victims of his rash actions br br paul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast br br alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school she has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died supposedly killed by her boyfriend alicia we realize is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life but we are not given any clues to that effect br br what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school at all when a ricochet bullet hit her she is hospitalized with more than a wound she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget br br alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal since she doesn't cooperate with the police the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows alicia dislikes deanna but in a matter of days both girls will make peace we don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school br br busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna victor garber james pinkins taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble br br the film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie
<START> this is probably the most boring worse and useless film i have seen last year the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clichÃ©s the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she scientist you add a 2 cent plot and you have i robot i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex audi converse etc this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book
<START> let's keep it simple my two kids were glued to this movie it has its flaws from an adult perspective but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it br br and the pepsi girl was excellent br br and kimberly williams was pretty gosh darned hot although she's not in the film very much so don't get too excited there br br not that's it's really a bad thing but it is the kind of movie you watch just once don't buy the dvd br br enjoy br br did i mention kimberly williams that was for the dads
<START> this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie i've ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead
<START> in the third entry of the phantasm series mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man assisted by a trigger happy 9 year old a black g i jane and the spirit of mike's deceased brother he died in the original phantasm number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand up comedian the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed which fits a story like this better also the settings aren't as macabre here plus the constant presence of the tall man agnus schrim isn't as obviousÂ there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time by the way beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off screen the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don coscarelli who wrote and directed 4 episodes so farÂthe fifth being in production the first one is a semi cult classic the second is a horror feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped a michael baldwin returns as mike even though james legros portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii
<START> i have a feeling that the warners bros depression era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years yes we are in the economic doldrums or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles in the 30's film going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom footlight parade 1933 was one such film that audiences flocked to while this lloyd bacon directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as gold diggers of 1933 1933 does it's still a wonderful showcase of talent we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me yes little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is so so but busby's magical by a waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking non musical scenes and footlight also has james cagney in at the one of his all too few musicals really what couldn't this man do he even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil who is really little ruby in china girl wig he co stars with joan blondell his adorable adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women until the final reel that is apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene
<START> anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city she has been with her husband sebastiaan for years and they don't talk so much anymore while on a working visit abroad a female colleague commits suicide anna is deeply impressed by her death even though she hardly knew her nobody seems to know why she took her own life for the first time anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest anna doesn't mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life and she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her br br this is my translation of the dvd cover text synopsis i hope you find it useful as this movie doesn't have an imdb plot summary yet at this date
<START> firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie bunnies being brutally murdered it's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over 8 to see this but don't get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn't scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a let's say 4 year old child to watch this it's just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i'm wayy over 4 and i was shocked by the violence i don't recommend
<START> well i don't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie br br and talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives br br i would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it grade d imdb rating 3 10
