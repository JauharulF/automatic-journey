<START> what can be said of the compelling performance of tara fitzgerald she is utterly believable as the injured mrs graham hardened by experience sharp and strong willed yet not immune to the passionate attentions of mr markham through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression toby stephens is a master of his character he is the force of passion and hope that will restore helen's injured spirit graves' huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue yet despite all he has done there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end he is at least aware of his own failings and how they have brought his ruin helen's attempt to save his soul after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of is a triumph of hope hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul however misguided however sinful that person may be markham's constancy may then be seen as her reward for her faith and unyielding moral character though the opinionated ideas of morality so strongly presented in tenant seem outdated by today's standards the story is imbued with integrity passion and conviction which still make an impact tenant is far more believable than wuthering heights or even jane eyre here is an adaptation that does the novel justice i highly recommend viewing it
<START> pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong br br examples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid particles can pass through barriers all of this so far is accurate but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this is complete poppycock instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against it br br this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with it br br plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour long episodes quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation
<START> this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot who is going to outsmart everyone acting is below average but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material all in all if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project this is a film to watch i guess that would be enough to say on this film everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough
<START> i'm one of the millions of columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this the episode that started it all on british channel 5 it is fascinating to think what sprung from this so so movie and i can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of columbo and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous classic series that said this particular movie is not as good as the rest except for the embarrassing final episode the patronising british episode if columbo had been made as per the original 'pilot' it certainly would not have gone on for very long or be watched and loved world wide in this film lt columbo is smartly dressed drives a normal car has a partner doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive there's also none of the cat and mouse chemistry between columbo and the villain watchable but only for the novelty of seeing how columbo started out
<START> since starting to read the book this movie is based on i'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i've ever seen it would probably not have mattered br br i'm trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it br br it's not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel i'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie it's more like some books just can't make the transition ms minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms minton's work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value br br i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since i'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess i'm writing this because i feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not i'm not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but it's too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own br br thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are
<START> jack frost is really a cool movie i mean its funny its violent and very enjoyable most people say that it is b rated but that couldn't be farther from the truth it has great special effects and good acting the only weird thing is of course the killer snowman i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late nineties most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece that is be original and give the viewer what they do not expect jack frost is very cool 10 out of 10 grade a ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost
<START> in spite of having some exciting and daring sequences nbtn just never gets going there are exploding boats hat pin murders mass suicides pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes but they're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition everybody in the movie looks bored this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed br br add to this the too proper brit characters and you feel like you've drifted into a sherlock holmes movie br br finally the cinematography is very ordinary there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull br br definitely only for lee and cushing fans
<START> spoilers br br tom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others br br here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup br br overall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice br br 7 10
<START> it was a saturday night and a movie called baseketball was on tv i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema boy was i mistaken words cannot describe how funny this film is starring the creators of south park who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny i taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time i have seen it 7 times im obsessed with it and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie a must see this is my 1 comedy of all time
<START> primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it br br a bunch of terrorists high jack a lorry and kill an entire army doing so they believe it to hold uranium but no it contains two dino's with a taste for human flesh then a crack team who might as well be called delta force get called in br br ok this ain't jurassic park and yes the dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a costume that's not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur only slightly less terrifying but come on guys this had about 1 of jurassic park's budget and as such does what it can br br does this deserve to be in the bottom 100 hell no i think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 are being way way overly harsh it's much closer to a 4 it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom 100 and has a similar production value to a sci fi channel production again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb br br the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously neither does the script br br all in all it's an enjoyable b movie not for film snobs br br out of

<START> i'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin my dissatisfaction is split 30 tone deafness 70 lackluster writing br br the 30 i agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it's inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling ever so short br br the 70 is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token minorities are one dimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i'd say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprise the stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending you're writing jokes br br spoilers below br br the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories that's fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voice over but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another br br meaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets outwitted by the girl he's hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we'd be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well a then b that's it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village br br it's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on new york i love you however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from the o c plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent br br for example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact he's the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend stepfather are strutting the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl's father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer what the dad can't be just some guy from south america now that he's obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle to upper class white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable br br it's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone but in every conceivable set up and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the single dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy how 'bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead again i'm not saying the entire conceit has to be changed it's just that every damn story premise is so hackneyed and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading br br i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well dredge and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldn't dissuade anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non superficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased that's what i love about new york everyone's from a different place well you wouldn't know it from watching this one
<START> i absolutely love this show but i saw the second episode first after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first the first episode's humor is not the best and they struggle to properly start the series however i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters as a first episode it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good the episode is not bad by any means but as the show progresses it becomes better and better so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show
<START> a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings she discovers that right before each ceremony the bride was given a rare orchid supposedly from the groom which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr lorenz who lives in a secluded estate with his wife in reality dr lorenz is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young patricia along with dr foster who is working with dr lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife try to force dr lorenz's hand by setting up a phony wedding which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor's clutches this movie had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes the cast is decent walters and coffin deserved better but that's life russell steals the show even out hamming lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances even considering his monograms as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today's hollywood prima donnas weak and contrived ending as well rating based on b movies 4
<START> why is it that any film about cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all julius ceasar and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the 50's admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex br br miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it didn't wash off on the others
<START> i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in orpington kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry winkler getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter laughter that lasted until the credits br br for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head but br br if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
<START> this is really a very bad movie why first of all the story is bad it is an artificial story combining all sorts of things together that make no sense it just seems a wrong experiment secondly the actors cannot play in a realistic manner they cannot even talk as an actor should why did i buy this movie and what must i do with it now
<START> so neighbor was killing neighbor reminds me of iraq as i watched the american flag 50 stars in 1864 being dragged behind the horse i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction indifference to the bill of rights i'm a southerner and must have some historical memory br br watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans his ethnic background being wagered at a poker game was interesting many twists in this movie the wife who is forced into her marriage shows both lust and a strong will characteristics we're not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles' br br the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin head of the copeland horse thieving gang inc in mississippi was hung about that time bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside armed remind you of iraq and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today br br too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying fomenting civil war everywhere that's mesopotamia now called iraq who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil the wild eyed killers in missouri raiding lawrence kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success br br another anomaly was the father's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school even before they erect a church and for that reason they'll win huh i was taught history in birmingham al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richer that's why they won course they also literally had god on their side as you see here when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother sold into slavery in texas god what a horrible legacy slavery gave us br br acting pretty good lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle but didn't hear any rebel yells so reminiscent of football games in alabama you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid they have lost sight of why they're fighting and so do we just more mindless slaughter br br you're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq as the bushwacker ahh what connotations first has his arm seared shut trying to save it then has it amputated and then dies so much suffering for such a stupid cause br br the cinematography is fantastic now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes one of my favorite parts of any movie i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era if you knew history the dialogue is definitely thought provoking not your ordinary blood and guts war movie by any means you see the wounded but still active duty soldiers still fighting cause they have nothing else to do you see the southern raiders living off the land stealing indiscriminately yet at the beginning you've seen the battle stop so the women could be evacuated from danger as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq i'm thinking where did we lose our sense of honor as a people i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years but some book somewhere lauded it with good reason tobey at his best pre spideyman buy the dvd or rent it and tell me why others laud this not just liberals cest moi
<START> having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat i could not have been more pleased the road to perdition directed by sam mendes american beauty is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time perhaps i'm just getting old perhaps i've just seen the same themes recycled time and again but this movie is indeed different br br the story opens with young michael sullivan jr facing out to the sea contemplating the duality of his father's legacy one of the best men to ever live one of the most evil this duality snakes its way throughout the movie the story revolves around crime boss john rooney paul newman and michael sullivan tom hanks the young man rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal angel of death rooney is tied by blood to his own son but tied by love and loyalty to michael young michael jr intrigued by the stories he reads steals away in his father's car one night while dad goes off to work with connor rooney heir to the family business connor lets the situation get out of hand and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder witnessed by michael jr upon the discovery that young michael has seen what he should not have seen the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide soon michael sr is on the run with his young son pursued by contract killer harlen the reporter maguire jude law br br i will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers however i strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie problems between sons and fathers michael sr jr john rooney son connor between the world at home and the world at work between good and evil between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are between clean money and dirty between the town of perdition and perdition as hell and along the way savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer conrad l hall 9 nominations 2 oscars for best cinematography rain pouring off fedoras shots through mirrors especially on swinging doors tommy gun flashes from out of the shadows absent any sound not only has 75 year old hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career but 77 year old paul newman offers one of his best performances ever br br yes i may be getting old but i've seen a lot and this is fresh and invigorating the road to perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre to films of the 40s to dark comic book figures lurking in the darkness to villains and heroes to american film in general go see it
<START> the tv guide described the plot of severed ties as thus an experiment on a severed arm goes awry so right away i thought this was going to be about an arm that s got a mind of its own as seen in the beast with five fingers or the hand or someone getting an arm transplant as in body parts both premises are tried and tested or to be more accurate tired and tested so i was curious as to how the producers would approach the story i actually thought they were making an arthouse movie like pi down to the use of b w photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to the evil dead i ve very little to say on this except that i disliked the evil dead movies and i disliked severed ties and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for condoms
