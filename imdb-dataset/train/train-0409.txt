<START> at a panel discussion that i attended after viewing this film the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought well the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie the gimmicks of the film documentary style futuristic setting served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate this film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir
<START> george p cosmatos' rambo first blood part ii is pure wish fulfillment the united states clearly didn't win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that us americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war e g we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single us american soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do
<START> i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from 1968 i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed br br boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls it's 1968 do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much br br i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown br br i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won't be all you expect i don't think you'll be too too disappointed
<START> confounding melodrama taken from a william gibson story produced by john houseman and directed by vincente minnelli richard widmark heads up posh upscale rural nervous asylum where his loose wife battles with self appointed queen bee lillian gish and widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff newcomer lauren bacall who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child facetious and muddled set in an indiscriminate time and place and with a david and lisa love story hidden in the plush morass widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together but this script gives them nothing to build on for precisely an hour most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library this thread isn't used as symbolism rather it's a red herring in a non mystery the picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right but unfortunately the roundabout way minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative enlightening nor entertaining from
<START> when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching bill and ted's bogus journey this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from bill and ted's excellent adventure with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie it's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh the characters being extremely like able and the story line being so radical you have to laugh don't expect 'deep and meaningfulls' just expect pure fun
<START> in sÃ£o paulo the upper middle class teenagers cristiano chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class they go to a party with drugs and booze on the next day after their classes the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl the girl dies they panic and decide to get rid off the body but cristiano's mother arrives startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase breaking her neck the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill but along the night other tragedies happen br br the polemic and shameful cama de gato is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years the shallow tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste the screenplay is not funny with stupid lines and dialogs and boring manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end the acting is terrible apparently with many improvisations but no talent and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash the camera framing cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking probably it is a plus since this flick sucks the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation my vote is one awful br br title brazil cama de gato bed of the cat
<START> this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds i've already preordered them i suggest you do to
<START> i can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that i was a huge fan the 1st season i was hooked all the mystery suspense unexplained events you never knew what was going to happen next by season 2 i was still watching faithfully but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained and instead of giving you more answers it just seemed like more questions i love suspense but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching br br now i can't even remember what finally turned me off but somewhere in season 2 i had enough i'm not a big fan of appointment viewing and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening so it was no longer worth the effort to me br br it's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out don't they realize that in the end they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain
<START> a fabulous film with everything you could want in a film huge battle scenes and lots of other action suspense and a romantic love story br br kind of like an old swashbuckler film totally entertaining from start to finish br br the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative the special effects are amazing too br br gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at he looks like a sure bet for super stardom br br john rhys davies is wonderful as he usually is he is one of the great actors of our time br br and cindy burbridge ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady even doing an english accent with remarkable success br br i found out that the film has won numerous awards and i can see why br br all in all this is an amazing independent film see it for sure br br i highly recommend it and give it a ten
<START> it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one i continued to watch every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously well as seriously as this genre requests br br the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clichÃ©d if a film was made in 1920 for example and had the quality of hide seek cord in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive as it happens this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one br br definitely not for the serious movie goer br br not worth a rating
<START> opening scene 'explains' why hurt is later 'immune' to the 'contaminated man' too bad it doesn't explain anything else how did he get whatever he 'caught' what was it why does it work so fast then we go to present day budapest ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe it's just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him aha so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys he's friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god sakes then there's the substance itself technically a poison but it mutates in immune 'carriers' so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life magically it's not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier how convenient then there's the h a z m a t protocol they jump into a situation without having any idea what's in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all
<START> hahahaha funny that sums this movie up in one word what the crap was this thing since it might kill me to use the word movie i hope the director writer and producer didn't mean for this to turn out good because it sure didn't a scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island oh my gooooooodddd i hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious parts because they were so corny and unprofessional and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic even though this thing had a bit larger budget than most low budget movies all i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting and stupid corny dialogue because if you are expecting a good movie you'll be highly disappointed
<START> it was and a simpler time the seventies a simpler place san francisco where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re crucifixion of christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion br br this movie tedious slow boring is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the 70's and i love it once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you can't take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end its kind of a cross between jesus christ superstar beyond the valley of the dolls and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed its simultaneously a train wreck completely fascinating and also a great snapshot of the worst or best elements of b grade seventies phychadelic film genre br br the plot br br i'll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater br br logan is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies richard dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him suzanne the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane artist character the artist is going completely mad by the way either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings all of course terrible nudes of susanne there are some other characters that randomly show up a cigar chomping the man character who also is all hot for suzanne i guess he has a monologue i couldn't really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate the man back then and you couldn't make a movie without one there is also a mute girl the mute girl pays off in the end trust me its incredibly stupid
<START> i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty i'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody but what can one say it's probably time for him to concentrate on his clarinett which in my opinion he is rather quite good saying all of this i'll still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future there's always hope and i'll continue to love and respect the woody
<START> as far as heist movies go this one is pretty weak continuity is pretty lousy there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters peter falk is great and he is one of the reasons its worth watching falk has some great lines like he'll be right back he goin' buy to some saugages or something like that there are a few nice scenes although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors direction script and editing is pretty lousy
<START> as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50's there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non existent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings i also couldn't help but think the budget didn't allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon honestly it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie it wasn't bad enough to be a good bad movie but wasn't good enough to be good either get the mst3k version it's more fun
<START> this is the most disturbing film i have ever seen it makes requiem for a dream look like a disney film although technically it is reasonably well made acting cinematography music directing etc are good however the concluding gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing i have ever seen and i really wish i had not seen it i am afraid that it will haunt me for the rest of my life although i think anyone would find the film extremely disturbing my wife and some of her friends were victimized in a very similar manner and i really didn't need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced i saw the film at the sxsw film festival in austin tx and none of the cast or crew were in attendance i would have liked for them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film which i felt was excessive gratuitous and unnecessary an earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were apparently striving for but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence this film should have a big warning label on it for these reasons i would not recommend anyone seeing it you've been warned
<START> no one goes to a movie like the hills have eyes 2 and expects the second coming of citizen kane the same is true for the majority of low rent horror flicks especially those roger ebert has dubbed dead teenager movies the hills have eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a dead teenager movie only here the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees br br some will argue the line it's only a movie when questionable facts are raised in a movie review but i've always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective in the hills have eyes 2 we're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert the dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess though the films aren't nearly comparable i kept imagining these soldiers being in platoon and shuddering with dread br br very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations a colonel is addresses as hey asshole by a private and nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do or any sense of command structure when things begin to go wrong i think of the soldiers in james cameron's aliens a film of pure fantasy and how even those futuristic marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations fantasy rooted in reality br br i try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 and judge it's strengths and weaknesses from there you have to allow concessions for the material there's no way star wars is as good of a movie as the godfather on equal terms but both are excellent examples of their type br br in that respect while the hills have eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing it's only modestly worse in that regard than the typical dead teenager movie on a technical side the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective scenes that are intended to shock or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work so while watching the hills have eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation br br it's worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage or those who don't tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the best ever or the worst ever of all time if you don't get horror especially the dead teenager variety you're not likely to have a good time with this one br br 4 10
<START> how to lose friends alienate people is in all honesty one of the best comedies i've seen this year along with pineapple express and step brothers its not one of those gross out comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative simon pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish out of water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in england the other two would be nick frost and edgar wright getting yourself in the top of the hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with pegg his first jab at the lead role was david schwimmer's comedy run fatboy run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike his second try is this movie got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office i for one still haven't lost faith in him and i'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory br br other characters were well cast from jeff bridges to danny huston and gillian anderson surprisingly kirsten dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to pegg's character however the spark that i saw in interview with the vampire is still lost she needs to find it fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of rom coms forever
<START> i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like 'man on fire' to find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it the story was treading water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous br br the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting ever br br i like tony scott's direction 'n all but this takes the whole friggin cake sorry ton 1 out of 10
