<START> foywonder's review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head make sure you read it in case you don't a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard the big foot family doesn't take kindly to this and proceeds to pick off the team one by one largely offscreen big foot himself has a distinctly ape like face but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons most of the movie has the wooden generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away this is a no budget movie in which very little happens at least on screen we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches but nothing comes of this
<START> maaan where do i start with this god awful movie bad bad bad story telling i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie namaste london was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest even the soundtrack was good but in this one oh my good for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one the songs are soooo bad ar rahman should have been the music director br br given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director even though the first half sucks the last 30 mins of the movie are ok performances from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total disaster br br watch it if you have nothing better to do the last good movie from bollywood i watched and i do watch a load of them is dev d and wake up sid
<START> so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not watch br br this show however i would recommend to anyone br br quite possibly the most original series to date it s got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast both japanese and american translation br br if not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another anime br br more or less as i have noticed a 'love it or hate it' very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it br br original to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it
<START> as a young boy i always sort of hated cinderella since i was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what disney movie to buy i wanted dumbo but my sisters won out and we got cinderella they thoroughly enjoyed the movie while i sulked in the back of the room playing with my star wars action figures br br a lot has changed since then my love of the disney theme parks landed me an internship at walt disney world and i now have two young nieces i like to showcase disney to them as much as i can and we recently watched cinderella together with my newfound appreciation for all that is disney i watched cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what i saw br br from the beginning of the movie though i didn't quite understand why cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament why was she such a slave to her stepfamily and why couldn't she just run away i wasn't too sympathetic to cinderella but as the story progressed i found myself becoming immersed in the story maybe the eye catching animation or the fun loving characters drew me in or maybe it was the timeless songs listening to songs like bibbidy bobbidy boo and a dream is a wish your heart makes sort of whisked me back to the theme parks i can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe inspiring cinderella castle br br something about this movie just evokes the magic of disney that may make many people scoff but go to the magic kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world and you'll know what i'm talking about the images of cinderella and the glass slipper as well as mickey mouse winnie the pooh and tinkerbell embody why disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world br br while cinderella may not be the strongest story it is sort of iconic in disney and movie history it represents that fun idealistic and fantasy like wonderment we held when we were kids i imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many many people out there it may not be my favorite disney movie but it does represent all that i love and admire about the company br br my imdb rating 10 10 my yahoo grade a outstanding
<START> are we talking about the same movie this movie is totally ridiculous the plot is disgusting and completely without logic its a typical straight to dvd tv movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience over acting by has been actors side steps from the plot that are left unexplained the girl shows her t ts why god why people do not react to things as they would in real life i'm not even gonna bother you with details it would take all night well ok just one if two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street one of the victims practically dies in your arms his blood spurts from his head wound all over you would your first concern be oh he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face my thoughts goes to harvey and his lost career
<START> i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all but just barely it's sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd exposing people who may not be too familiar with l h to their worst stuff rather than their classic comedies br br once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who's invented an invisible ray he's in love with the bosses' daughter who hates him and prefers some slick guy it's incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what l h needed in their films br br without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy insurance on stan br br otherwise this script is just a mess forget this and see if you can find a copy of a chump at oxford or bohemian girl or sons of the desert instead
<START> i was lucky enough to attend a screening in stockholm for this elegantly expressed enjoyable and thought provoking film with romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in paris navigating the different forms in eighteen separate quartiers but without pouting parisiennes and saccharine formulas its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors' parts Â frustration over only having 5 10 minutes of screen time Â thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party br br debating whether or not i should review all 18 segments i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long winded instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills and certainly you'll find your favourite although gus van sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective his les marais is one of the better contributions even sneaking in a well placed kurt cobain reference the coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve buscemi deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre and perhaps rightly so br br in this way all story lines are exquisitely unique Â filtered through the minds of different directors Â but the one that deviates the most from the rest is vincenzo natali's quartier de la madeleine a dark horror gothic love starring elijah wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of paris in the night who meets a vampiress with a black and white format but blood red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city Â a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film br br yet my single favourite segment was faubourg saint denis by tom tykwer but i think i was conditioned to think so given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying finally that's my favourite director here nevertheless it cannot be denied that tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman for once not annoying that she breaks up with him and he reflects on their relationship as is tywker's style the story is dizzyingly fast paced kinetic and repetitive featuring screaming and running lola rennt making it the most adrenaline pumping segment in paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool Â music br br to fill the negative account clearly not all directors manage as touching as tywker van sant cohens coixet and dÃ©pardieu sylvain chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met they are two lonely mimes this part is so in your face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard looking juliette binoche whom mourns the loss of her son nothing else happens finally the wrap up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half hearted br br yet paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality for all the other stories are well crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing it is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 not saying much i suppose and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite highly recommended both to mainstream of pretentious heh audiences br br 8 out 10
<START> so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills natica jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didn't br br 1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasn't br br 2 the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice br br to conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life as i did
<START> mating game is a charming wonderful movie from an era gone by hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie my wife and i would go see it br br it is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on amc br br this movie has tony randall at his best debbie reynolds is great as always br br loved it we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of movies br br too bad hollywood does not make movies like this anymore br br hey hollywood time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe update them a bit without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes and hold a casting call br br a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen dvd and on cable sattv br br sn austin tx
<START> this movie has great style fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme but all in all i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it big impressive powerful bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty br br plot a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship br br sword boy is on the planet for a reason he just doesn't know what it is yet br br lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively br br russain w eng subtitles slick worth a watch
<START> rated pg 13 for violence brief sexual humor and drug content quebec rating 13 should be g canadian home video rating 14a br br i have seen police story a couple of times now in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the protector i have not seen the protector so i cant compare the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film br br runtime 106min br br 9 10
<START> i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it so it seemed promising and it was until justin timberlake came on scene he is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again i mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors i've ever seen he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack i think matt damon would have been a better choice br br kevin spacey was another big disappointment his character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en it might sound cool but believe me it's not br br now dylan mcdermott's acting is very good it's about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspired br br morgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines though br br about the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when lazerov dylan mcdermott was killed but nothing really happened
<START> this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular amelie both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role laurent firode the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory br br the film deals with chance as its english title indicates the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly as well as hurricanes in the pacific something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects from the start the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other something that is hard to imagine but in the film's context seems to work well br br a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film irene who is going to work is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper irene it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day after irene leaves the train the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene it seems they are destined to one another from the start but alas they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film br br audrey tautou is wonderful as irene faudel who plays younes doesn't have a lot to do until the end but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film which is as light as butterfly wings br br we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected
<START> the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it's suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito's way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlito's close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie they're not even mentioned luis guzman pachanga in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969 70 considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier wouldn't you think one of carlito's long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito start's out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail that's only a few month's between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it's an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to gail it's the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release
<START> 1 2 for this diane keaton farce br br someone should tell ms keaton enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats br br this flick is just too much as keaton's daughter sara dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives br br keaton who could not be reached by phone at first as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug grieves in a new way for grievers br br she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara's friends are staying she cleans the house sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter in addition she had an abortion thanks to this guy we're all now put on this guilt trip br br her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept she also hopes that boyfriend adam who is a playwright will not include all this in another play br br when the diary is found it has been written in japanese sara had a ph d in this language it's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant br br naturally everything seems to tie up nicely in the end br br the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz every time mom and sara would speak they would both utter surrender dorothy br br as if this isn't enough during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film interiors where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman ms keaton also tries drugs with the group come on folks can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this br br fair to mediocre best sums up this film
<START> time is precious this film isn't i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time br br the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction is this the film the critics are raving about what a piece of crap br br the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family get it br br the acting is superb br br the production lighting sets editing sound is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story the characters are shallow and unintelligent i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next br br i have had more fun doing the laundry
<START> i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting
<START> the word in the summary sums it up d'oh five girls get lost trying to find their way home when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them ooooh br br from there out everything is screaming crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie very annoying the movie is shot with a cheap camera trying to make it seem real or shocking i guess it's just embarrassing and useless though in lack of anything better to compare it with blair witch style br br the screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying you literally get a headache br br i'm sorry but this was not scary only an annoying painful piece of crap movie
<START> after the superb aankhen 2002 which was a remake of a gujarati play he comes with waqt which too looks like a stage play br br in stage plays we have characters shouting overacting here too the same br br the first half shows amitabh almost kidding the 40 akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd br br the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fake br br even his reason for hiding his sickness his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put off br br some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top br br rajpal's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half br br direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okay br br amongst actors amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan
<START> this film is one of tom cruise's finest films he captures the audiences imaginations with his role of david aames his character can relate to us all in some way the story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film i never really watched cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent my favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try it's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did and it became one of my favourite films of all time it's a 10 10 i promise once you watch it it will stick with you and you will like it forever
