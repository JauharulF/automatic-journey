<START> this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process br br i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can't say i'm picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can't think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
<START> the question is can a movie this entertaining really be considered a bad movie my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words vestron pictures on it vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films suburbia and class of 1984 we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was your basic plot as is follows grange this goombaesque thug from planet earth robs the bank of the moon and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet i don't even remember the planet's name to mine for bauxite and other minerals the governor of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor walker a bounty hunter apparently one of only three on the whole planet reminds the prisoners that there is no escape because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with then there's the nameless colonel a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare much of the movie centers around futuristic car chases dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides with explosions galore the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid 80s i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack i can't even remember the names of the bands they're listed in the credits other than exploding white mice because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie but i'm definitely looking into them br br basically the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends
<START> the reviewer from poland must be a feminist for she finds young catherine to be a great film and historically accurate nothing could be further from the truth as a practicing russian historian for many many years i took exception with yc at almost every turn and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single handed moved russia into a direction of dominance the truth she was only brought to st petersburg to be a wife and mother and found she had to bond with the dvoriane the boyars and the military just to survive so long as she did not challenge them she was able permitted to indulge her cultural wishes filling up the hermitage with art treasures etc there are so many proofs that she was not great but in this area of post modern revisionism proof is not very popular yc is only a costume drama a bit of fluff from ted turner that like peter the great in 1986 is one more example of how badly russia is portrayed in the west
<START> this film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of guns germs and steel explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe br br the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes there are completely useless scenes of professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly professor jared diamond firing a muzzle loader badly was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of professor jared diamond this part of the documentary was so bad it could have been a spoof the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital none of this helps me understand his theory of guns germs and steel btw guns germs and steel is said about 100 times can the europeans guns germs and steel get them out of this dire situation stay tuned and find out when he finally gets down to business his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons do i really need a professor to convince me of this the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting but the coverage is paper thin br br in the end i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non europeans are as capable as europeans if i'm not a racist i already know this if i'm a racist jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements br br i don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary kids may enjoy this more than i though i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary
<START> i rated this movie as awful 1 after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offend everyone the trailer said well it did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and what's with all the gays in this movie i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like that br br so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy's it really is total crap
<START> this was another obscure christmas related title a low budget mexican production from exploitation film maker cardona night of the bloody apes 1969 tintorera 1977 which Â like many a genre effort from this country Â was acquired for release in the u s by k gordon murray judging by those two efforts already mentioned cardona was no visionary Â and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better the film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which in view of the prominence of reds Â apart from st nick himself the devil plays a major role in the proceedings Â throughout was essential anyway in a nutshell the plot involves satan's efforts to stall santa claus' christmas eve rendezvous with the earth's children there is however plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with our portly white bearded and chronically merry man in red lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toy maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel in their native tongue visits merlin Â the famed magician at king arthur's court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child like hopping and mumbling gibberish Â once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way the wizard's anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weightÂso santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney the devil's antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up st nick's delivery program then is perfectly puerile indeed their tit for tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel hardy routine more than anything to pad out the running time we focus on three sets of children one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wish fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra large packages a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little one's dreams Â to no avail and a trio of brats who egged on once again by satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves there is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay
<START> i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci fi story in a book or on the screen there's social commentary speculation and a good story br br there's something eerie and amusing watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60s and 70s br br i think it's a must see and not only for sci fiers
<START> this is the biggest flop of 2008 i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it
<START> as far as films go this is likable enough entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in br br glasgow in scotland yet every character is english save for sean's girlfriend who is dutch scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs roles as a scottish woman as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life i really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actors or at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent the futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult
<START> must every good story be improved with added corny broadway music apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that so of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting argh fetch me a basin br br the four stars in my rating come from casting which i could liken to that of my fair lady each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing see complaint above unlike my fair lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed pardon if i'm mistaken it's been a while br br my biggest complaint i've stated why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story seldom has this been done to good effect generally it ruins the story it did with this one jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about it's impossible to tell
<START> poor ivy though to the manner born she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel richard ney as the movie is set in the 20s or 30s when rigid victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges this uncertain status vexes her unduly the gretorexes for so they are called don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her when ivy joan fontaine makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent herbert marshall who must have been born middle aged she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him luckily one of the beaux she still strings along patric knowles is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison with which she bids her hubby farewell the fact that it implicates knowles doesn't phase her a bit even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead the turning of the plot depends on police inspector sir cedric hardwicke knowles' mother the redoubtable lucile watson and knowles' loyal housekeeper una o'connor sam wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest
<START> when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not it was not scary at all acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid i think the sci fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible one out of 10 max im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this beyond loch nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci fi channel is better than this movie
<START> eytan fox whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics has made several quite interesting films in the past such as walk on water and the simply wonderful film yossi jagger in the bubble however he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme br br far from giving this film a standing ovation the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left i also quietly left fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one sided film that translates self preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying and terrorism as outbursts of justified anger which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one sided israeli aggression against them and that they therefore should not be held responsible for their actions br br this film wasn't worth the money i paid for the ticket indeed i considered demanding my money back and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film paradise now if you want to be an anti israeli then by all means watch this film as it really justifies just such a belief system the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and even worse such a talented israeli director is a crying shame indeed just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti israel propaganda beggars belief br br what a shameful horrid little film
<START> i love the munna bhai mbbs but lagge raho sux really sux i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers br br may be spoiler br br an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai people discussing their personal prob on phones come on man from which part of the world u r i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible br br 2 out of 10 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting

came up next jericho tried to teach cena a lesson as their match began by suplexing him to the mat jericho continued to knock cena around the ring until his cockiness got the better of him while on

hit a belly to belly suplex but couldn't put y2j away jericho launched into the lionsault but cena dodged the move jericho nailed a bulldog and then connected on the lionsault but did not go for the cover he goaded cena to his feet so he could put on the walls of jericho cena had other ideas reversing the move into a pin attempt and getting the 1 2 3 jericho went berserk after the match winner

steps out of frustration brock pulled himself together and began to take charge with paul heyman beaming at ringside brock slammed rvd to the hard floor outside the ring from there brock began to overpower rvd throwing him with ease over the top rope rvd landed painfully on his back then had to suffer from having his spine cracked against the steel ring steps the fight returned to the ring with brock squeezing rvd around the ribs rvd broke away and soon after leveled brock with a kick to the temple rvd followed with the rolling thunder but brock managed to kick out after a two count the

the frog splash he went for the pin but heyman pulled the ref from the ring the ref immediately called for a disqualification and soon traded blows with heyman after rvd leapt onto brock from the top

and begged her to stop stephanie cited that triple h once told her how bischoff said triple h had no talent and no charisma bischoff said he was young at the time and didn't know what he had but he

up against each other in a triple threat match with the undisputed championship hanging in the balance taker and the rock got face to face with kurt angle begging for some attention off to the side he got attention in the form of a beat down form the two other men soon after taker spilled out of the ring and the rock brawled with angle angle gave a series of suplexes that took down rock but the great one countered with a ddt that managed a two count the fight continued outside the ring with taker coming to life and clotheslining angle and repeatedly smacking the rock taker and rock got into it back into the ring and taker dropped the rock with a sidewalk slam to get a two count rock rebounded grabbed taker by the throat and chokeslammed him angle broke up the pin attempt that likely would have given the rock the title the rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to kurt angle angle reversed the move and rock bottomed the people's champion soon after the rock disposed of angle and hit the people's elbow on the undertaker angle tried to take advantage by disabling the great one outside the ring and covering taker who kicked out after a two count outside the ring rock took a big swig from a nearby water bottle and spewed the liquid into taker's face to blind the champion taker didn't stay disabled for long and managed to overpower rock and turn his attention to angle taker landed a guillotine leg drop onto angle laying on the ring apron the rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on kurt angle taker nailed rock with a ddt and set him up for a chokeslam angle tried sneaking up with a steel chair but taker caught on to that tomfoolery and smacked it out of his hands the referee got caught in the ensuing fire and didn't see angle knock taker silly with a steel chair angle went to cover taker as the rock lay prone but the dead man somehow got his shoulder up angle tried to pin rock but he too kicked out the rock got up and landed angle in the sharpshooter angle looked like he was about to tap but taker kicked the rock out of the submission hold taker picked rock up and crashed him with the last ride while the dead man covered him for the win angle raced in and picked taker up in the ankle lock taker went delirious with pain but managed to counter he picked angle up for the last ride but angle put on a triangle choke it looked like taker was about to pass out but the rock broke angle's hold only to find himself caught in the ankle lock rock got out of the hold and watched taker chokeslam angle rocky hit the rock bottom but taker refused to go down and kicked out angle whirled taker up into the angle slam but was rock bottomed by the great one and pinned winner and new wwe champion the rock br br finally there

<START> morgan freeman and paz vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other morgan freeman is superbly human relating with one and all while paz vega is the edgy cashier behind the 10 items or less check out line intimidating customers and bored out of her mind together they explore discover and learn from each other to do that of course they must be vulnerable interested in change and have a sense of humour all of which they both have i wish this film was realistic i wish this type of story happened more often i wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds the film's message is based in the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there a world where peace could be a possibility
<START> i began watching this movie with my girl friend and after 5 minutes i was alone br br i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experience br br i liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie br br there are only 5 characters and the rest could be called 'art' or something that i couldn't express but that i didn't understand at all br br the only worst movie i saw was crash but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again br br good luck o
<START> i have to say as a bsg fan i wasn't exactly sure what i'd think of this show i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight as part of the paley center screenings and the cast and film makers spoke after wards ron moore said they 'wanted to make a clean break from battlestar and do something different and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others br br even without their talk i am now a fan of the new show but here's what i thought of the film br br i loved it it was really very good i guess i'm a true sci fi or 'syfy' do i really have to type that geek because i'd totally watch this as a series it has a strong and rich story and kept my interest br br it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing the actor playing ben should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs the actress playing zoe seemed a little posy but she was playing a teenager and i'm sure i won't be the only one who thought zoe was a cylon at first perils of being a bsg geek if they're hoping these will be the new bamber helfer park they may want to rethink it surprisingly it was the adults that captured the audiences attention br br eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters traps her then dismisses and releases her no sign at all of the 'serial killer' he played on gray's anatomy really impressive acting br br equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltz's part and i completely believed that they are a couple and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship something rarely seen these days i look forward to seeing what happens with this family and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid you cringe it's really great not to mention her eyes which could hold magical powers that's how intense they are the scene where she takes on the government agent very short scene but beautifully played really gives you an idea of her power br br the other part of the show that did not work 100 for me were the scenes with esai morales and the mafia type clan of his he does a good job overall but i did not believe in this mobs power nor intimidated by their threats i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit but given time i can see how this will develop into an interesting 'upstairs downstairs' kind of thing with the poor minorities morales et al versus the rich folk who rule the planet stolz et al and to be honest i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name that was a very well played scene br br note to bsg fans the boy playing 'willy adama' doesn't really look much like olmos but he's just a kid whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film who knows i sure couldn't tell but it didn't bother me because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him br br polly walker plays 'sister clarice' and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in i'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with but i was very impressed with her acting in this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on she was nothing like her character in rome something i always find impressive in actors br br one nice surprise the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg even though it's the same guy doing it bear mccreary it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise i'd buy this score if i had the chance br br as to the 'panel discussion' after the show it was hosted by seth green ron moore was very smart and articulate david eick was cracking wise much like his video diaries esai morales told a long story about how he was cast and eric stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions but i've always had a thing for him paula malcomson was tough she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on '24' and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling grace park and tricia helfer were there as well answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg overall a very interesting and wonderful evening br br i'm giving the show a 9 out of 10 and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold br br note i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for i have no idea what that may be but it holds a great deal of fascination to me
<START> the idea behind this film was a good one too bad it wasn't written well casting sidney poitier as the fbi agent was a good idea and he did an outstanding job tom berenger on the other hand only knows one emotion in most of his movies anger kirstie alley's character could have been a great one and even showed some possibilities once but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be i don't care for alley's acting anyway the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did the director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action i will keep this in my collection only as an example of poitier's performances
<START> from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it played by bertille noel beuneau br br the story's frankly quite simple and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust and how they go about hanging around each other dealing with respective adversaries and the likes here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picture postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture br br but while we indulge in wistful scenery the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a leveler in food the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course while i thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a prey br br between the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it otherwise it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers br br as a film i would've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins but i guess the way it was resented probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel bruneau and the multiple foxes that played renard
