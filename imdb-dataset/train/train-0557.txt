<START> first things first edison chen did a fantastic believable job as a cambodian hit man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed in a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in cambodian thai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone else's leash br br like danny the dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others it's a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production br br edison plays a hired gun from cambodia who becomes a fugitive in hong kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu fai who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti sam lee who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kong br br the story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit man and the cop on opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey with the hit man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl pei pei bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold the cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done there are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti hero despicable strategies are adopted you'll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end if i should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment listen out for the musical score too and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs br br highly recommended especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre
<START> magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess br br a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused br br i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament br br i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i'll be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
<START> i hate this movie it is a horrid movie sean young's character is completely unsympathetic her performance is wooden at best the storyline is completely predictable and completely uninteresting i would never recommend this film to anyone it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see
<START> this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie br br the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add br br the clichÃ¨s are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mystery br br this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label br br i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash
<START> fast paced and funny satire about that original reality tv the soap opera the script by playwright robert harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations the best of them is the climax a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant keven kline's murdering of his lines due to not wearing his glasses is hilarious her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses the brilliant cast is on the same page as kline sally field elizabeth shue cathy moriarty robert downey jr whoopi goldberg teri hatcher garry marshall and kathy najimy are all perfect it is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie this is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks br br p s the score by alan silvestri is an added bonus it fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air
<START> the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie as usual tom villard is good too otherwise it's c p the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out the possessor lame
<START> it's great how this movie pulls you along i had honest laughs don't care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me to be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string these characters who's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world just keep going and be who you are dreams are what you make of them in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through what can i say i like my fun with some complexity anyway liked it hope to see more
<START> don't watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http imdb com title tt0283181 br br the death of yugoslavia documentary series of five episodes is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990's it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both yugoslav and otherwise the only real improvement which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the balkans since the program was made this was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on bbc television but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work perhaps another whole episode might be warranted the very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term yugoslavia by the now named federal republic of serbia and montenegro a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before br br not fiction like in yugoslavia the avoidable war 1999
<START> i think anyway is a kick ass movie really tom barman spent like years making it and it shows every scene is polished has a meaning i guess most agree on that one thing many people tend to criticize is the lack of story i'm afraid that that's an effect of us being overwhelmed with traditional storytelling all the time i mean what you can achieve with a book you can't achieve with a movie what you can achieve with a movie you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy the problem is that we're so used to movies series to be just a filmed version of a story a visual recording of events just like when you watch the news that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events and i stress the idea of unusual events most people see on tv in the news in movies series very unusual things once in a lifetime situations and here in anyway there are unusual events but not in the same hollywood big explosion kind of way guy gets fired couple back together car gets stolen and of course very usual things and that's strong just being able to appreciate all of that that universe that's art and i agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central but not like in traditional visual movies visual blockbusters such as the matrix it serves the characters and remains deeply human i mean in every shot you feel the love that tom barman has for antwerp and urban lifestyle and he has no point with this movie like to learn us something and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists he just shows everyday people with everyday lives he shows a city all with their good and bad sides and says this is us that's our city that's life let's enjoy it so basically anyway is not only that super groovy movie it also has a much stronger message it's not explicit maybe even not intended than most movies how really intend to pass a message one drawback now we'll have to wait five years to see the next barman pic and everyone will expect so much of it
<START> first i was caught totally off guard by the film's initial lyricism and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing the characters were all fully developed not bigger than life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world in sweden in turkey or in america all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright and that shows the brilliance of the director hearfelt thanks to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat
<START> sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric one that never gets dirty never wrinkles or wears out when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers who will lose their jobs and the owners who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so guiness' performance and a great supporting cast such as greenwood thesiger and parker and mackendrick's direction make the film a delight but the real hero is the story itself a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama romance and suspense rating 8
<START> i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his all time worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written molasses like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy watching it is a true bummer i give it 1 out of 10 truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that i have ever seen
<START> this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast some great looking sets costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life she'll end up shudder alone i felt queasy i can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release it's the sort of fare one expects from those women's cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this film's target audience but boy does evening miss its target
<START> the film was shot at movie flats just off route 395 near lone pine california north of the road to whitney portals you can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built and you'll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie br br i won't bother with the plot since i'm sure it's covered elsewhere the movie stars three athletes fairbanks fils who must have learned a good deal from his dad grant an acrobat in his youth and maclaughlin a professional boxer from south africa their physical skills are all on display br br not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously it's about thugees a sect in india whence our english word thug i can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director george stevens was a polymath with a background in laurel and hardy movies see his choreography of the fight scenes and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of shane and the diary of anne frank dynasties rose and fell geological epochs came and went while liz taylor and monty clift kissed in a place in the sun here in his comic mode he excels br br this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy too easy to read homoeroticism into it as many people do with howard hawks or hatred of women but it isn't that at all sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not women share secrets read deborah tannen nobody's idea of an anti feminist well when you think about it that's what evolution should have produced for most of human history about nine tenths of it hominids have been hunters and gatherers and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather hunting is more effective as a team enterprise men who were not very good at bonding were darwinianed out leaving men who have a lot of team spirit and grant fairbanks and maclaughlin have got it in spades br br sorry to ramble on about evolution but i'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease did i ever tell you about the horse in vaitongi samoa that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me you've got to watch the hooves br br joan fontaine is lovely really only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies i lived in saratoga california where her sister olivia dehavilland grew up and went to a convent school pretty place br br if you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the british empahh at its height you should never forgive yourself it's so famous that it's parodied in the peter sellers movie the party yes the colonel's got to know
<START> bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i'm not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i don't know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of firefly serenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliens br br the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical blood spurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors don't play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people don't watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx aren't too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc br br the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at best br br basically an okay watch is you're up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene
<START> keanu reeves stars as a friend of a popular high school student who suddenly commits suicide he and his friends go through emotional turmoil and share their reactions to this horrible incident good acting by reeves and a young jennifer rubin but on the whole is a little too much 4 of 10
<START> the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker a young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived extremely boring and very predictable in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie br br avoid this one at all costs
<START> my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several dvd's made on dvd r from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
<START> i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have it may be the worst film i have ever seen i'm surprised a distributor put their name on it
<START> wow i just finally managed after several attempts to finish watching this god awful movie only to learn that rick sloane and his production team have completed a straight to video sequel this year br br of all movies reviewed by mst3k and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel screening the reputationally bad 'manos ' 'werewolf ' 'the incredibly strange ' and the lesser know disasters like 'laserblast ' 'zombie nightmare ' and 'time chasers ' this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they'd ever shown which makes it perfect for riffing very simple the movie is about a bunch of munchies like gremlins on the loose exploiting people's desires for fame fortune prowess and of course sex in ways that end up with people getting killed but this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous a test of machismo for example is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools the writing is so forced such as the oft described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it if only she turned her head a quarter to the left and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens and the story is so rarely given attention hence the mst3k riff about a law in the future where films have to be made by filmmakers that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen worst movie ever
