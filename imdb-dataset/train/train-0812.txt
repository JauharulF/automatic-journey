<START> what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro in his most overdone performance and that's saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood and mr scorcese especially attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back in any case this movie is awful br br
<START> i just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this the profit and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap this movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults don't try to watch it thats the reason i think hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building the sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art the only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list i am giving 2 stars for supporting the india's cinema efforts but for nothing more or less
<START> if you want to laugh like crazy rent cage cage is about two war heroes billy and scott who are best friends when billy is shot in vietnam he is unable to fend for himself so scott takes him in br br i have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters billy and scott love to wrestle and scott tells billy that he is still sore from last night among other things br br wonderful catch phrases like shut the sh t up and ping pang pong cut the sh t will keep you laughing for hours the native american guys that are supposed to be playing mexican gang members are also top notch as they say it's party time right now ba ba ba ba ba ba i could go on forever but just watch this movie and laugh your a off it was so funny i went out and bought the dvd for 5 99
<START> its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies and i do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from the acting is terrible it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there its terrible the name should scream don't watch 'how she move ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes these ones don't even deserve a watch i give it a 1 out of 10 just because there is no zero i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this and not to waste your money the 1 6 10 should tell it all this movie should not have even be made
<START> i wasn't really going to comment but then i figured i had something to say i saw this film two days ago and although i think it's not a complete waste of time it might have been of money though for the producers it's obvious it has serious problems it's got really good cinematography and little but nice music a lot has been said about ana cristina oliveira but let's be honest over what she is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over acting and preposterous under acting her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like odete in any other film crazy sad childlike an impostor no one knows fellows so she's kinda sorta dictating the rules here br br i thought this film was also a good example of the problem most portuguese films suffer from soundtrack there is a permanent no to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue people in other countries may think portugal is the noisiest of places what thrilled me though was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome bad dubbing too i must say it's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene when the first character speaks is it's dubbed and all this to say that the film has technical problems br br it also has script problems it tries to be classical from the first to the last scene there was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but it shows all dialog is too expositive and there isn't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film it's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant br br not that the film is a total mess i must stress i just think the good parts are so obvious that i prefer to concentrate on the bad ones br br direction brings little to the weak screenplay all shots are classical and un innovative but their beautiful great work from rui poÃ§as by the way br br now what i think was the problem the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously not an actor actually it's a rather important role and i can't see why non actors are cast for such parts this guy is neither an actor nor a good looking man which means the whole film rolls down the mountain since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss when all we see of this character is apathy too bad the world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers the world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after they's gone the world is full of great films and also of not that great films c'est la vie
<START> well maybe i'm just having a bad run with hindi movies lately i asked the video store guy for apharan prakash jha but being a new release wasn't available yet so i had to settle for this one it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i've seen and i've seen quite a few no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world if imdb had negative ratings i would give garam masala a 10 br br i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up for some strange reason people expect good stuff from piyadarashan i did not like hulchul hungama or his other films hulchul probably dubbed from tamil or telugu came across as very loud in your face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a bollywood flick this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains who made him a director even a bollywood director at that br br anyhow to the film now what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non sensical woman hunt two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment isn't it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office jezuz christ now they're copying their own stories well anyways there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi lateral love aka multi tasking multi timing what happened in the end i've no idea i switched off mid way what ridiculous junk i can't believe they even released it and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth for which audience did they make it the poor illiterate indian masses 700 mil at last count or the well heeled nri desis staying in phoren either ways it doesn't matter neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god awful stuff br br its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of f grade garbage bollywood should change its name to follywood and yes this review is much better than the movie itself
<START> cool idea botched writing botched directing botched editing botched acting sorta makes me wish i could play god and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning
<START> i read rice's novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths br br however i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation the casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent with the obvious exception of peter gallagher who was neither blond haired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag the cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised i made it to the end br br a warning to fans of the novel stay away from this one

<START> possible spoilers ahead br br gerald mohr a busy b movie actor during the forties and fifties leads an expedition to mars before we get to the red planet we're entertained by romantic patter between mohr and scientist nora hayden resident doofus jack kruschen and the sight of les tremayne as another scientist sporting a billy goat beard the martian exteriors feature fake backdrops and tints ranging from red to pinkÂ the cinemagic process touted in the ads real cool monsters include a giant amoeba a three eyed insect creature an oversized venus fly trap and the unforgettable rat bat spider the whole bizarre adventure is recalled by survivor hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs the angry red planet reportedly has quite a cult following and it probably picked up most of its adherents during the psychedelic sixties
<START> this movie is a bad memory from my childhood this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess and you'd rather be watching anything anything else at least that's what it was like when i was in elementary school i just remember hating this movie granted i haven't seen it in 15 years or so and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them trust me pick anything else even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow that i can't remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here 15 years later i felt the need to warn all of you against it
<START> in april of 1965 cbs broadcast the first of barbra streisand's monumental television specials the show was not only a runaway ratings success but garnered 5 emmy awards as well this is one of the most memorable moments of 1960's television and unfortunately the kind of television special they don't produce anymore filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by barbra this special is a must view for any streisand fan and anyone interested in early television
<START> i saw this film in my cinema class i am glad that i did not pay to see it i came into it with an open mind and was even a little excited i really enjoy ed norton and evan rachel wood and the rest of the cast was interesting i just never connected with this movie the acting was great the cinematography was interesting but the storyline or rather lack thereof was a problem there was no central connecting theme to the movie was it a romance between norton and wood well no not really was it a western kind of but no i'm all for twists in movies i recently saw brick and loved it but the place that this movie went was just too out there it was so weird and if i weren't required to have sat through the whole film i would have walked out the writing wasn't terrible but it was just all over the place by the time this movie ended i was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner there was just something about this film that didn't resonate i understand more offbeat films like fight club but i just did not care about the characters at all
<START> i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival with the great dr uwe boll in attendance br br the film is simply put very very bad and no not in the usual uwe boll so bad it's actually entertaining way but just plain bad the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently can't get a job and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife this man turns to his cult leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence br br the acting is awful except for dave foley who really tries despite it all the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion and people taking a poo it's supposed to be satire but i'm not sure of what br br think airplane but done by the creators of south park and without any jokes
<START> i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me there's nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
<START> perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini who wrote the novel on which this film is based it's a neorealist fantasy kind of an oxymoron really an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son after a few years the baby is a young boy named toto and the adoptive mother is dying he goes to an orphanage and when he finally turns 18 he leaves immediately he finds that he has no home toto is optimistic though and won't let anything get him down a man steals his valise and instead of getting angry over it toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown soon the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves after many attempts the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless at this point the film becomes full fledged fantasy before this it was more comedic fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin this stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves it's quite amazing and very funny there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan most certainly fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release at this point though it's so enjoyable i loved it very much it might be my favorite of vittorio de sica's films although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very very close 10 10
<START> i watch this movie all the time i've watched it with family ages 3 to 87 and everyone in between they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just beautiful br br it's great for thoes who love comedy movies the tear jerker movies or even just pets br br the music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities shadow the oldest a golden retriever he's the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance the american bulldog puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character and sassy the hymilayan cat she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real girly one
<START> made one year before ilsa she wolf of the ss blacksnake could have easily been called susan she wolf of the plantation and it probably inspired the producers behind the nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical a gorgeous horny head strong but stupid blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control whom all hate her and want her dead sounds familiar director russ meyer and david friedman the producer behind the ilsa flicks are good friends and they started their careers together so obviously there's a connection there looking at blacksnake i can't help but think that russ meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because xxx movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s and russ meyer films though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence were never even close to real porn his films started to look positively quaint next to deep throat and other hard core porno blockbusters meyer knew he couldn't compete with such films and blacksnake is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career he obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory but blacksnake bombed at the b o and meyer quickly returned to making vixen type of films that even if they still weren't pornographic they were most definitely more over the top than any of his previous films br br it's no wonder blacksnake was a b o failure it's just terrible trash o rama jaw droppingly bad it's a quasi campy take on slavery if you can imagine that the end result is jarring one minute we're in typical meyer territory exuberant playful and silly and then the next minute super serious meditation on slavery and violence huh it just doesn't work the slavery racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category but blacksnake is not as sleazy as ilsa she wolf of the ss and those kind of films so i imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or russ meyer fans meyer blames the failure of blacksnake because and i quote it didn't have enough breasts in it well i'm sorry russ but the film is just bad breast or no breasts but he's right though about the low breast quota except for anouska and the maid the film's cast is male meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big david darth vader prowse and with anouska's right hand man around who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men one can only wonder what meyer was really trying to create here br br blacksnake stars david warbeck who is lusted after by anouska and her right hand man poor david he looks totally befuddled by the whole experience he did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that at times he has no idea what's going on and then there's anouska hempel she's a beautiful woman for the 1970s not the 1870s with her makeup and hair she looks like a typical 1970s brit pin up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix and her wardrobe is hilarious at one time she actually unzips her leather boots i didn't know they had zippers in those days but the character she plays is in itself really degrading no pun intended she's nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men and that woman on the island for example one night when david and anouska are getting it on her annoying slave driver walks in the room knocks david unconscious and tries to rape her groping her savagely the next day the slave driver is still working for anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened it's totally ludicrous under any circumstance had her character been a real person anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island or even killed him but the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters' credulity to the max br br ridiculous details like this and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes blacksnake a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie watchable in the train wreck variety i just couldn't help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch so this being an exploitation film i guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do but blacksnake is mainly for russ meyer completists
<START> i've read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these accusations this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monster slasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going on br br ms barbeau is a miracle to behold she carries the film squarely on her shoulders br br this is not to say that it's a masterpiece unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to coexist and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it br br still i give unholy points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing
<START> made me wish my own happy birds could talk tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie a sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy paulie is a lovable little treasure he has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh i especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint you can forgive the obvious clichÃ©s as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with marie a charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey i liked her artistic and poetic inspirations a shame she could not share paulie's reunion bless paulie in his new home at last with marie perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey
