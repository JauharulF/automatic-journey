<START> once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who tvm as soon as it was announced that the doctor s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed who is eric roberts i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school actually looking back now roberts is best known for the pope of greenwich village and runaway train but that didn t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who tvm a great many fans myself among them thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production br br yeah i m digressing but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i d heard the name of eric roberts but i didn t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it i know nothing about fencing everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not i don t fence so i don t know how accurate it all is but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn t have worked a lot better if it d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max suba and alexander villard being off centre for most of the film but i wasn t convinced about their love hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword
<START> i really liked tom barman's awtwb you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts and don't expect anything it's like sitting on a cafÃ© terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching the people go by it definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards that's true but that's not a prerequisite for a good film it's just the experience during the movie that's great br br i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more but being a lynch fan i don't care that much anymore br br and i loved the style or flair of this movie it's slick but fresh and the soundtrack is a beauty any music lover will get his kicks out of awtwb i can assure you br br i'll give it 8 out 10 br br music wise 10 out of 10
<START> i only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with opening night and that's bergman' s persona both movies are simply amazing they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight we have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to the accidental death of one of her fans a young girl that declares her love for myrtle and she is then hit by a car leaves a deep mark in the actress she starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol but that doesn't help to much and myrtle is one step away from complete madness the scene where she kill the imaginary or not spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes i found in a cassavets film the movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and gena rowlands improvise a scene since myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately this scene was filmed spontaneously with a live audience the laughter is genuine the chemistry between casavates and rowlands absolutely amazing if you liked persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine
<START> i think 'blackadder the third' is the best one of the series br br actuelly all the episodes are funny personally i really like the episode with the 'french invasion' but the one with the superstitious actors in 'macbeth' is also really funny the way rowan keeps playing on with them is really english humor at the highest level br br actors 'never say that again always call it the scottish play blackadder oh so you want me to say the scottish play actors yes blackadder rather than macbeth br br i am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work but i think he did the series of blackadder especially good br br i hope rowan is going to continue his great style but i think we can count on him because he is already working on a bean 2 movie that will be out this year i can't wait br br i give this 3rd blackadder a 9 out of 10 rating
<START> if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures do not worry about it it would be classed along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like family planning br br it was co produced with kotex to teach pre teen girls about menstruation supposably it only educates at a superficial level so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated ram's head reproductive system sequence br br the film does show the wonderful world of disney elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story br br this film is impossible to find so if you can find the film best luck to you and enjoy
<START> financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry big budget large cast extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didn't work for the out of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen's hands since the great duke ellington's number is savagely chopped but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look the 'sweet marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie carl brisson's acting is bland as melba toast but he's a competent singer maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a 7 0 as a curiosity feb 2010 re think i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the raciest major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history financially speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out 1934's search for beauty a must see for pre code buffs
<START> no laughs whatsoever yes i watched this entire train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if cleese had come to his senses in the latter part no he had not br br this may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there to see that british humor included black jokes like these thirty years ago br br what amazes me even more though is to read the other reviewers' comments which acknowledge this isn't very good yet then turn around and give it high votes if the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one then i certainly pity your torturous existences br br the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids yet the subject matter does not so who is this for people who enjoy repeated drawn out double takes pratfalls drug jokes interesting only as a short trip back to '77 and other low humor the three stooges are still funny and were to me as a kid too they exerted some effort in making jokes work this however is sloughed off schlock i fear that it is the end of civilization if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile next you'll be telling me that tabloid tv is popular
<START> the first half of this movie is a pure delight novel funny wonderful performances a close knit brother and sister living in manhattan fall for the same woman adult bright witty what more could you ask as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing it heads into unexplored territory and then it falls apart br br it goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming of age coming out of the closet story that has been done many times before what a disappointment as a people film it begins with such promise why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian i am who i am film the freeze frame ending shot of heather graham's jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself underlines the banality of the last part of the film br br it could have been different it could have been magical it ended up being the same old same old
<START> no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that here's a few different slants on it from one of those religious nuts as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly br br 1 baby face 1933 offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film look cute bat your eyelashes offer your body for free and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want br br in this case it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money lots of it at least four men in this film do provide just that even if it ruins their lives in the process br br 2 the ending which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate gives another great message all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled a sad comment that so many critics here would rather have immoral messages preferring sleaze over substance no surprise i guess br br any way you look at it the movie is entertaining start to finish and stanwyck has some great lines particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers at a little over 70 minutes this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it
<START> poor tobe hopper he directed an all time horror classic texas chaimsaw massacre since then everything he's done has been horrible this is probably the worst and that's saying a lot it's about a man brad dourif who has the ability to make things and people catch fire or something like that hardly an original idea anyone remember firestarter it's a real mess literally everything is done wrong pathetic acting even dourif asinine script loust production values crappy special effects everything is bad a must miss not even good for laughs
<START> this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
<START> in new orleans an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal blackie walter jack palance he is chased by blackie and his men raymond fitch zero mostel and poldi guy thomajan killed by blackie and his body is dumped in the sea during the autopsy the family man lieutenant commander dr clinton reed richard widmark of the u s public health service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty eight hours to avoid an epidemic the city mayor assigns the skeptical captain tom warren paul douglas to help dr clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them br br panic in the streets discloses a simple story but it is still effective and with a great villain the engaging plot has not become dated after fifty seven years jack palance performs a despicable scum in his debut and the camera work while he tries to escape with zero mostel is still very impressive my vote is seven br br title brazil pÃ¢nico nas ruas panic in the streets
<START> this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies' style that could be termed zany beauty vidor's direction is light but sure handed the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the star watching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a knee jerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br
<START> i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid i snuck downstairs really early one morning started watching hbo and the raft segment 2 terrorized me good this time around i still enjoyed the raft although i couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short the other two segments were complete trash i can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk all i've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory creepshow 2 will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics 4 10
<START> i'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe i'm not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything it's over the top in a big way br br the acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through that's not what i call real br br it is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut off from reality rob thomas and his staff are br br overall i found it to be at best a snooze fest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but it's hard to tell with the over the top style of the whole show
<START> being an elvis fan i can't understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis' grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in 1958 and these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike starr is funny specially as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis sucks overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you bubba ho tep instead of this mess
<START> a bug's life is a very good animated feature this movie is for younger children but it is also a great movie for people my age the story is about an ant named flik he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's the story is good but a little more detail would be suffice the voice acting is good as with most animation movies the music is nice to listen to nothing special but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories overall this movie struck me as awestruck this is a good movie for all families i rate this movie 10 10
<START> the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i don't think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's the subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didn't stay for the q a either br br i don't think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didn't get woody's carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about what was he thinking i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody's character car it didn't work it didn't even seem to make sense really br br the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br as for lauren lily and kristin boring br br don't see it it is painful unless you are a true harrelson fan
<START> i'm a big fan of films where people get conned and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre in short it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what's happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this it's still difficult to guess where it's going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con br br house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer at times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride
