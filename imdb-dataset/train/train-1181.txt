<START> this film may seem dated today but remember that it was made in 1974 before saturday night live before howard stern back when george carlin was just getting beyond the hippie dippie weatherman and into heavy satiric humor this film is the granddaddy of them all enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its strong entertainment value
<START> i'm not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make
<START> this is a badly made poor remake of bimalda's classic parineeta the story is based on sarat chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham shekar's father's choice of words in abusing lolita balan sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where shekhar saif slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit the work falls apart the song piyu bole is quite ok another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized br br well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times br br this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world
<START> while the original first blood had its far fetched moments it was at least exciting in parts in rambo first blood part ii the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic book action plausibility is totally rejected logic nose dives stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission just like any other wish fulfilment actioner of that time e g invasion usa commando red scorpion rambo first blood part ii cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers what is left to get excited about br br imprisoned after the events of the first movie john j rambo sylvester stallone is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the far east the year is 1985 and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american pows still trapped in the jungles of vietnam rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel trautman richard crenna but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by marshall murdock charles napier rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american pows Â if it doesn't he is to rendezvous with a chopper if it does he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge the beautiful and resourceful co bao julia nickson sure enough rambo discovers that there are pows in the camp but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of themÂ when he reaches the rendezvous point the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of murdock who it seems doesn't really want to find any pows because of the political and military implications rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the pows and get his revenge on the treacherous murdock br br the few good points of the film come from jack cardiff's polished photography jerry goldsmith's exhilarating score and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics beyond these scant pickings the film is a failure the actors are reduced to macho posturing the plot rings false the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless the dialogue is absurdÂ even the violence becomes numbingly predictable at the time of its release america was under the presidency of ronald reagan a man with simplistic and near hysterical anti communist sentiments for this reason contemporary audiences lapped up this commie bashing shooting fest as if it was the greatest movie of all time transforming it into an undeserved box office success thankfully times have changed Â nowadays we can look upon it as a simple minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count ludicrously dumb politics and a ludicrous hero
<START> taiwanese director ang lee whose previous films include 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm' turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of missouri br br as one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family jake roedel tobey maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the south br br lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities br br the performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified up and coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold blooded killer while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience
<START> well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr seuss's classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie
<START> this crap is like watching paint dry i'm so disappointed because i was so eager to see it br br there simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care it's hyped up because of all the big names in it but if nobody's were in nobody would give this film any love br br seriously i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the friggin' joy it's the ocean's 13 nothing but a big named cast of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic oh until it's finally over br br i'm sure they'll all be nominated for oscars br br 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
<START> i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didn't pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
<START> dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller br br i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it
<START> this wasn't really a very good movie there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience this movie was produced by magic johnson isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film a film produced by a former nba star doesn't come along every day you know beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho every clichÃ© trotted out for us to groan over teen sex and it was all produced by magic johnson i can't say enough about this movie teen drug use college hijinx and it was all produced by magic johnson yippeeee
<START> audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out the structure of the film really divorces from sap happy hollywood conventionsÂas well as other major theatrical elements it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light films of this natureÂthe neo realist filmsÂwere made to reflect the darkness felt during post world war ii times ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war including adultery conspiracy murder pregnancy etc aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot on location uses natural lighting and most likely non popular actors all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film yielding the following theme negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally br br the two leadsÂgino and giovannaÂare polar opposites yet both carry the mentality we're bored and we want to be entertained gino is a drifter a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations giovanna is a bored house wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence she doesn't want to leave her home and husband but would rather remain where she is because it's safer gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfÂthat's why she falls in love with gino he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandÂgino is the perfect ticket into that world the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy i mean films prior to the neo realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before to say the least it was probably a bit alarming br br in conjunction with the theme the neo realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior succinctly put adulterous behavior as shown in the film leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to eliminate giovanna's husband karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done they return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting as can be expected from the neo realist style they are not happy they're actually more depressed they thought that by eliminating giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives but they were duped the film ends with giovanna's deathÂit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons here's why br br there's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen and if so to what extent i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have as the subtext of ossessione asks is adultery and murder evil i think the film eagerly responds yes the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are ironically though towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car the author of the film shows that their happiness is in fact a faÃ§ade the car crashes off the cliff and into the river killing giovanna the police arrest gino i think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior in the end karma will come back to haunt them i agree i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishÂalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship he can't handle the pressure of living in giovanna's husband shadow so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl such is typical of the insatiable hedonistic personality br br all in all the film seemed very risky for its time the audience however was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought those pre war happy go lucky films were no longer being believed movie going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems ossessione then acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading that is a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo realist film movement
<START> if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out
<START> this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about br br incredible visual effects very good acting especially from shue everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails br br picture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here played by kevin bacon could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac br br add to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man's wolf br br even as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me br br if you read the actual book while the scientist cane goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad
<START> a very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and possessions grows pot in her house smokes it with a few old biddy friends and then sells it that's the story for this low key comedy emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings for much of the film it works the humor isn't of the laugh out loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour and a half so i guess it serves its purpose br br there are funny moments and brenda blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role but the ending really ruined a cute movie with insultingly bad messages that only the ultra liberals of the film world would like to see happen br br like most people i would prefer a happy ending too but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law also in here are the typical 1 children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay 2 clerics portrayed as morally weak people and 3 even a medical doctor who gets stoned too br br hello and reviewers here blast hollywood this is exhibit a how a secular society has lowered the standards in the uk and europe in general hey people at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a timothy leary if it feels good do it message
<START> police story is one of jackie chan's classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative even today no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts many people were hospitalized in police story including jackie chan the fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan's use of props throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass the action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan's coordination is outstanding br br the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action however for the time period it was made in the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining there a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well br br overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored
<START> when i saw the dentist i thought it was very cool but this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes that's why it has it's r18 rating it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman it's best to go to your dentist before you watch this but if you don't like going to the dentist already then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist spoiler pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic overall awesome flick but not for everyone
<START> earth is a must see for children and adults my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth there are some animals in danger to disappear exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet br br this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music the director did a great job here that gets high respect nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel
<START> this musical is decidedly mixed and none of the elements really fit together but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel but none of its virtues though he co wrote the script the songs though charming have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot even by pre oklahoma standards burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points br br there are a few high points reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops mugging like a silent actor and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied
<START> there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie which is a prequel to the tv show that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment both before david lynches disgusting style of story telling and after br br from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaks br br to the mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak fire come walk with me br br i watched it all just to make sure i wasn't missing anything i didn't it's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie br br i have heard a lot of reviews rants and raves about how great david lynch because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing this is not life imitating art as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless life br br do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage
<START> any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry br br aside from that the film is really an old fashioned love story boy meets girl boys loses girl boy gets girl back br br the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt general webster riccardo montalban is a close second my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3 star general the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates it's a wonder they show him any respect at all br br brando's southern accent is a little overdone and some scenes have a few holes but overall i enjoy the film every time i see it br br red buttons is great i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles as in button's case often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor
