<START> unfortunately for me the first busby berkeley movie i ever watched was 42nd street i then expected all of his stuff to be that good i found out that wasn't necessarily the case even here with my all time favorite classic era actor james cagney br br oh the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome they seem to always involve screaming unhappy show producers in this film it's cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin fast br br even the songs in here are anywhere near 42nd street class songs you could hum for years and years decades i should say the songs in this movie are not memorable no this is one of the few early cagney films and berkeley films i totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching
<START> being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co stars in maureen o'hara what an exquisite beauty and anthony quinn i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure br br hollywood at its best
<START> wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at check in and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if super efficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like 'we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it' well forgive me but didn't they already have her daddy ready for slaughter so you better oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn't it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important 'call' required or even cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists keep the dumb dad in distress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist assassin couldn't the massive bazooka missile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the 50th story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they'll speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow star trek style gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to perhaps get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as 1 bazooka 2 car 3 boom my 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod hitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops her allies or getting on the blower at a call box direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhood watch district crushing the front porch in the process an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren't even mildly curious thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all cillian surely renamed silly 'un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i'd better stop because the stream of drivel i'm writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams hadn't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from 'red eye' to 'no eye dear' rr
<START> i saw this film on the history channel today in 2006 first of all i realize that this is not a documentary that it is a drama but one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events reagan was shot and the other characters were real people the movie got that right from there on reliance on facts rapidly decays i had never heard of this movie before seeing it having been a tv reporter at the time of these events i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary haig as portrayed by richard dreyfuss the whole nation had heard the i am in control etc but dreufuss' haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally having watched the film i began researching the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to reenact incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a white house secret service etc in total chaos and the nation's leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war are demonstrably incorrect they didn't happen there is internal conflict to be sure haig makes missteps his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film there are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish enlighten inform entertain i believe they failed on all three fronts it is difficult to ascribe motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention and as for my beloved history channel's reel to real follow on documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting so the viewer was left to research those without much if any help from the network
<START> i always thought this would be a long and boring talking heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrasts although there's hardly any action the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit
<START> the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror cult cinema and every new movie he releases Â which is about two three per year Â immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism you're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype you know like it's popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not let me just assure you that this is not the case uwe boll is a terrible writer director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film making industry seed is another most unfortunate of proof that in here boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist like a plot a narrative structure character development tension buildingÂ seed is a hideous movie full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage i once read that seed was uwe boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks but that's not even close the film inarguably does borrow some influences from saw and hostel but basically it's just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence br br the first 45 minutes of seed are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen for you see boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a hyper fast scrolling text explaining there's a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail so you know this will happen later on but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims exaggerate much who wears a bag over his head he watches real life animal cruelty footage and thus we watch real life animal cruelty footage thanks for that mr boll and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted when he's finally captured during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed and put on death row the film even becomes more retarded after being buried alive because the electric chair couldn't fry him max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him br br the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad they're downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic multiple twists and sub plot in seed are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they're just too dumb nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him seed is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes personally i refuse to accept that the cast crew members didn't notice this as well it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to i imagine his yelling stuff like shut up and do as you are told to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they're shooting doesn't make a lick of sense br br just for the fun of upsetting people there's a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room instead of shocking as boll intended it to be this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is seed is horrendous it's disgusting it's pitiable it's Â boll
<START> first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful this movie has every horror move clichÃ© in imagination and all badly played the over sexed teen couple the comical not horny jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parental type couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool it's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jameson's implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
<START> a pot boiler if ever i saw one a supposed thriller borrowing from a time to kill silence of the lambs even an inverted in the heat of the night with a little reverse murder a la strangers on a train thrown in it fails abysmally where all the above to a large degree succeeded namely in delivering thrills the plot seems condensed from a bigger book making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving while the direction lacks pace and verve to rein in any kudos a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too connery is clearly slowing down in his old age barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh darn kids of his he even has a father in law who seems younger than him laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie they do confusedly here the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles the supposed climax managed too to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back not as should have been the aim front edge of my seat mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure
<START> of all the movies i've seen this one rates almost at the bottom haunted mansion nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom it is hasty the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical oprah gives a palatable appearance as bigger's mom but is not nearly at her potential other famous performers also seem to be at their worst the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk now the family he's working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are so when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins caterwauling the blind mother yes hears this so bigger tries to silence her but instead smothers her now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do he shoves her into the coal furnace so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom if your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40's and 50's or see a good drama there are a lot better options avoid this
<START> the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline otherwise this movie was terrible the acting was ridiculously bad and the set design was cheesy and very tacky the story was decent but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting i wouldn't recommend watching this one the only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive especially ryan bauer the man who plays the soap opera star some of the editing was well done but there are continuity errors all over the place i'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad can we get a good one soon
<START> for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate which basically satanised the english it was interesting to see this film by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in and they were the only nationality present it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all
<START> brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing no one knows why or who but an investigative reporter luana walters notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator dr lorenz bela lugosi now dr lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife elizabeth russell with the fluid of young brides to keep her young br br the corpse vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldn't be able to get boring unfortunately while it starts off quite well it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichÃ©s and predictable plot br br there are some good things about it bela lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly elizabeth russell is also a beautiful suave aloof and very creepy countess and i'm always a fan of angelo rossitto luana walters is also convincing as the reporter here br br it maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent br br but overall it just didn't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture and for that i have to rate it poorly
<START> okay i seriously can't think of anything worse than the pr series there are many bad things in life traitors liars etc but seriously power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list can you think of anything more stupid than five six teenagers who don't even act like a normal teen dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart fans have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured power rangers are for five year old boys and believe me i never liked this show even when i was five br br i guess you can say dino thunder is an exception the teens actually act like teens and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor or no a teacher it's got teen humor though the fighting is lame i don't hate dino thunder br br many people say power rangers are crap but i wouldn't it would be an insult to crap so face it five year old boys power rangers is rubbish
<START> this film has scenes that come back to me at the strangest times that intense scene with mr muckerji telling mrs melandez that someone he spoke with witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits her description is one that rolls around the way she keeps referring to him by name in a greek accent mr muckerji and then when boyer discovers her having just taken poison and gives her one last smack up the side of the head before she dies its a delight fools fools all my life etc etc you get the point i have to buy this one i love dan seymour's acting he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in casablanca and many great pictures
<START> bad actors terrible script totally unbelievable ending this film had it all after seeing films like this you wonder why the makers bothered at all this film has absolutely nothing to say all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films a total waste of time
<START> melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film it's up to the local town sheriff dan burke bo hopkins the wild bunch and his annoying mystery loving goody two shoes daughter marci dana kimmell friday the 13th part 3 to get to the bottom of these killings br br this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's slasher brethren it doesn't hurt that alesia has a great body i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted on the downside the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary a grating theme some that is used a bit too often and an ending that is a tad anti climatic but the good outweigh the bad barely give this a rent but i wouldn't buy it br br eye candy aleisa shirley shows her tits bush and ass br br my grade c br br code red dvd extras an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder scott spiegel both director's cut theatrical version of the film audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos interview with shirley sotos bo hopkins still gallery theatrical trailer for this film and trailers for nightmare stunt rock rituals balalaika conspiracy
<START> here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isn't the concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation they are not believable in the way they act and interact example jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here i mean what is that he looks like he's on the toilet or something i loved him in re animator and the way he was playing the intense neurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money but not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner it's not natural i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming the movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come
<START> 'i don't understand none of this makes any sense ' exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie i know exactly how he feels the story by the film's director aristide massacessi good old joe d'amato using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murder mystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain conscious br br opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by ewa aulin who stars in the equally strange 'death laid an egg' is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrÃ¼ck after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home where she is tended to by creepy dr sturges klaus kinski in a throwaway role the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr and mrs ravensbrÃ¼ck meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin' br br 'so far so good' i thought to myself at this point 'we've had hunchbacks incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female nudity'Âall ingredients of a great trashy euro horror what follows however is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from edgar allan poe's 'the black cat' to tell a very silly utterly bewildering and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave br br this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb but given the choice i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible meandering surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing 2 5 out of 10 purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness rounded up to 3 for imdb
<START> where to begin br br 1 amitabh's son played by akshaye khanna is 30 br br amitabh's been in prison for 33 years he br br a telepathically transmitted the sperm home br br b asked a nice pakistani guard to mail it for him br br c they allow conjugal visits in secret pakistani jails br br d all of the above br br e the producers were having a little too much bhang at br br the time they approved the script br br 2 amrita rao yummm wants khanna he's yum yum yummy and apparently he wants her who wouldn't right but when her dad gets ratted out and then killed i hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you'd have to be brain dead and blind not to see this coming in the film he's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip metaphorically of his hat leaves her behind to save his dad never mind her loss and says paraphrasing if god wills it we'll meet again basically meaning i'm gonna get my dad and my job done sorry for your loss cya buh bye callus beyond even low life hollywood standards br br 3 there are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie that you can drive all the jeeps trucks camels and any extra stuff through it pass really complete and total waste of time oh there is a great dance sequence yes only one as in dance sequence regardless of quality great belly dancing but not worth watching just for this br br rent veer zaara or lakshya will hrithik roshan ever take acting lessons for better indo pak conflict movies in fact veer zaara is pretty damned good 7 5 8 i'd say
<START> i'd give this a negative rating if i could i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson oh how original if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie became so popular seriously the worst thing i've ever seen i wasn't entertained it wasn't funny i wasn't even bored i wasn't anything it wasn't even so bad it was good it's just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don't even rent this movie no clue how it's getting such a high rating
