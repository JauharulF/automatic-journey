<START> even in the 21st century child bearing is dangerous women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely seventy five years ago it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth that is the theme of life begins a look at the difficult cases ward of a maternity hospital loretta young plays the lead a woman brought here from prison what crime she committed is not germane to the plot to give birth she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth she's in a ward with several other women who share their joys and pain with each other br br although loretta young is the lead the outstanding performance as usual is put in by glenda farrell farrell was one of warner's b women in the 1930s showing up quite a bit in supporting roles and sometimes getting the lead in b movies farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the torchy b movie series here farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children since they'll only get in the way she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses including smuggling liquor into the ward this of course during the prohibition days and drinking like a fish apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s br br interestingly unlike most movie of the early 1930s it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men that situation is reversed with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers life begins being an early talkie treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama to be sure but it's quite a charming little movie turner classic show it albeit infrequently i've only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up
<START> this was a very thought provoking film especially for 1973 at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten but its central messages were too important to disappear completely it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time no one had ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect'before 1985 and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up br br the sets and special effects might look a little outdated but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions br br this was also hestons last good film the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made and the ending might be creepy and depressing but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this
<START> blue monkey 1987 or 'invasion of the bodysuckers' as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant the man gets rushed to hospital where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie i found it to be boring with a flat predictable storyline un interesting characters cheap special effects and lack of action horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down you wont be missing much trust me i give this movie 2 10
<START> i was very pleased to go and see a milanese film shot in milan alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy br br film tells the story of a standard in career milanese couple starting from the birth to the death the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the urbe of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher then finally the product a child who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle's director br br the actors are well chosen stefania rocca nice and well characterised and a positive surprise an unexpected good fabio volo well known by the trash tv serie le iene br br rating 7 10
<START> absolutely horrific film ameteurish and it isn't funny at all lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by e t and star wars is just plain stupid br br actor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this movie is a garbage br br director gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date br br music of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
<START> what can i say that hasn't been said about the haunting it has everything that would make a great picture wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way the entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her but that's about it all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more a lot more
<START> this was on at 2 or so in the morning one saturday a few years ago for various reasons i don't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters dom has had a unfortunate lot manipulated literally working a rubbish job eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling tom hulce' dom doesn't plead for sympathy it comes naturally ray liotta is a universe away from henry hill displaying a soft centre in what must feel a thankless position br br in many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carer's face the past or the future as it turns out with some work the two can happily co exist thoughtfully handled sensitively played dominick eugene is difficult not to warm to
<START> we purchased this series on dvd because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here i gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting directing and writing are brilliant in fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series if one watches it with discernment one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the fox faux news network to avoid giving away any spoilers i will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances a brief look at the plots found here on imdb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide infomercials and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world we watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using attorney general gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us the series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people all in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing br br no doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that america lost its way in the early part of the this century as a student of history myself i would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by goebbels for hitler and some of the propaganda produced by hollywood for the american audience during wwii br br so if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at faux network who produced this travesty
<START> i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn't automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that i've seen that getting better doesn't just happen it's hard work and takes time it's a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
<START> first off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a james bond effect what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006 it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 dr no 1962 being the second while in golden eye the first film with pierce brosnan judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male m so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double 0 aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older this is more or less a poetic license to thrill we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained no the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago in the 1960's communicators were fantasy now we call them cell phones and there were sliding levers instead of buttons omg do you think 400 years from now they would have perfected rogaine for jean luc picard so please let's give the producers some leeway br br but to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica if that is the case where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space well what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human looking cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one they colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the cylons time paradox of course which came first the chicken or the road who cares it's fraking entertaining
<START> although john woo's hard boiled is my number 1 favorite movie but i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie i say this because the stunts the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when jackie chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor ouch buy it at amazon com for 14 98 or something in 14 dollars vhs new line home video any questions or comments please feel free to reply i'm only 14 but i know where you can find any movie ever made if you looking everywhere for a movie and can't find it please reply to me thank you and good night
<START> something happens to sondra pransky when she enters the magician's box on the stage of a london theater little does sondra know the spirit of newly departed journalist joe strombel materializes to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him on his voyage to another dimension is the infamous tarot killer that has been on a binge of crime in london the only problem is the man accused is for all appearances a respectable upper class man br br when sondra tells her experience to the great splendini who is a k a sid waterman the magician is stunned but decides to go along the two would be p i s conjure an invitation to a club where peter lyman goes to swim sondra who fakes she is drowning catches the attention of this hunk who wants to see more of her br br needless to say the two of them will get into all kinds of funny situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the film little does the real tarot killer think he can fool a resolute sondra who proves herself to be more resourceful than he gave her credit for br br the result is a perfect summer film with a lot of laughs that is just what one needs to get out of the heat into a perfect time in a cool theater woody allen has done better and yet this sunny comedy will vindicate him for past failures in scoop mr allen has taken himself from the romantic lead pawing his gorgeous leading lady his trade mark gesticulating is something this funny man will never get rid of since it appears to be his trade mark the film has some funny one liners that will go over the head of the viewers that might not be paying attention br br scarlett johansson the beautiful star of scoop seems to be the perfect foil for woody allen she plays the straight part while mr allen does his shtick a perfect combination both are excellent in their banter throughout the film ms johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathing suit although they have dressed her so dowdy in most of the costumes she wears on the screen hugh jackman is seen as peter lyman a sophisticated man about town with the right pedigree he makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing ms johansson ian mcshane plays the dead fleet street journalist on his way to eternity br br scoop is a light film for the hot and humid summer thanks to woody allen
<START> mr vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football unfortunately it didn't make the goal the historical subject of giants is a good one but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese i say take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff i couldn't even watch the entire film that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie i always like to give them a chance for last minute redemption it's impossible to redeem something this bad well at least the acting was good not br br the only thing falling in this film is the rating 1 10 and sinking into the negative numbers
<START> i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i'd seen burning moon but while that movie was rather grim and nasty premutos seems to mostly play it for laughs while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this i found myself constantly battling not to fast forward to the next gore scene sure there's gore and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy but be warned there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition many are comparing this to peter jackson's movies especially braindead but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in bad taste it's clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has talent 3 10 for pretty good and plentiful gore effects and for getting the most out of limited resources but not worth the money i paid for it
<START> curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the man in the mac and also fade into murder br br furthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here br br this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation br br columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here similar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celeste's holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughs br br the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime br br ironically what turns out to be arguably columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut manicure at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious it's just that columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed then he can't afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle br br sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes br br for columbo completionists only
<START> though i really didn't feel anything for lance's character and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development perhaps with lance i would have liked it better br br however i have to completely agree with doyleluver when they said and to quote glenn quinn's character ben 'i'm the star here in it that's right i'm the talented one ' if you watch the movie just watch him even when he's in the background just his facial expressions all in the eyes you know for sure what motivates ben exactly how he feels about comments even if it's a quick look behind a character's back great acting in a fair film
<START> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn 8o br br zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 8 br br oh um excuse me sorry fell asleep there for a mooment now where was i oh yes the projected man yes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 8 br br ooops sorry yes the projected man well it's a british sci fi yawnfest about nothing some orange headed guy projects himself on a laser gets the touch of death at last he vanishes the end actually the film's not even that interesting dull droning starchy stiff and back breakingly boring the projected man is 77 solid minutes of nothing starring nobody dull as dishwater dull as doorknob dust dull as ethan hawke we're talking really dull here people but wait in respect to our dull cousins from across the puddle the moocow will now do a proper review for the projected man br br zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 8
<START> having seen and loved greg lombardo's most recent film knots he co wrote and directed that feature as well i decided to check out his earlier work and this movie was well worth the effort and rental macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek excellent take on the shakespeare favorite updated and moved to nyc i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself and very cleverly at that the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeth's castle mr lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty something new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare the movie is well paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth it reminded me of al pacino's looking for richard another wonderful shakespeare play within a movie i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan
<START> this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies it's about two guys that wish that the world would go away and that's exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictable and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie
<START> this is not a children's movie br br this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of 5 for a month my 4 year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn't the worst of it we stopped it about a 1 2 hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear
