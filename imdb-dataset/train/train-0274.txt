<START> i don't know why i keep doing this to myself i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances and then they smack you around the head with junk like this intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch speaking countries it's a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween the producers and writers aimed really high with this but fell really low intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here it's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions like the night of distaste for exactly 5 minutes intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline then it changes into a lame and low brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome yet very hilarious and cheap make up effects the acting of the entire cast is abominable even though there are a few respected names involved the leading male role is played by koen wauters this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium he's a beloved singer host of tv shows and idol of many young girls he never ever mentions this thing he starred in though like everybody else in the netherlands he's trying to convince himself intensive care never happened
<START> watching speak easily is painful for fans of buster keaton seeing such a phenomenal writer actor comic director and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a picasso used as a drop cloth or perhaps more like seeing the finest camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into cheez whiz br br keaton is ill cast as professor post whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying tell me about the rabbits george post would have said something like kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family leporidae of the order lagomorpha kind sir who i believe is primarily addressed with the epithet 'george' when keaton created his own characters they might be situationally clueless but they weren't stupid they were quick studies and became masters of their worlds not so with post who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the titanic and while keaton's original characters had a charming naivetÃ© and innocence post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused he'd put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help br br there are a couple of small redeeming moments such as keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampish thema todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a greek dance but it's just not worth enduring the entire film to see them br br if you're a fan of bad movies get drunk and watch speak easily with friends a la mystery science theater 3000 but other than that stick with the silents let them be 100 of what buster keaton is remembered for
<START> cheap amateurish unimaginative exploitative but don't think it'll have redeeming amusement value about as unentertaining uninstructive and just plain dull as a film can be
<START> exactly what you would expect from a b movie deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects of course it could have been better better acted defintly better written directed etc but then i guess it wouldn't have been a b movie the actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nudity br br tiffany shepis must be singled out she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors she's also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie wow her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked br br so if your a looser b movie horror buff like myself check this out if not you should probably avoid at all costs
<START> having only seen two of his pictures previously i've come to terms with altman before though i always labeled his style of film making boring you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius br br health is fairly underrated and very questionably out of print in fact i don't think it's ever even been issued to vhs why is that when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily this one is left behind for no good reason honestly i had no real problems with this film it was for the most part consistently amusing and funny almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances there is real skill here br br and paul dooley's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating br br if you can try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem it's not perfect but it's much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases hell i'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing br br it's often on the fox movie channel though so look out for it
<START> this is the biggest piece of lamo i've ever watched it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1 br br the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is unintentionally funny are absurd and just plain wrong not one thing is funny about this movie they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting honestly though i didn't watch it to the ending but that should say something about how horrible it is worst movie ever br br immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie then zach peed his pants thankyou for your time
<START> i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now the first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour an engrossing entertaining film thank god no kiera knightley in it refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make nothing bad about the movie at all no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne
<START> saps at sea is evidently a pun on a gary cooper film souls at sea the title aptly describes the starring team stan laurel and oliver hardy who go on an ocean voyage to soothe ollie's nerves only to run into escaped killer nick grainger as played by rychard cramer this criminal is both amusing and chilling making him a fine foil for the boys' comedic characters despite his powerful presence cramer never upstages the boys a tribute to stan and ollie's beguiling charisma that is as it should be since the boys are supposed to be the protagonists in this film br br such is the charm of laurel and hardy's personas that they elevate average material for saps at sea has its slow spots for instance as a previous commentator has noted a bit where a doctor the delightfully flustered james finlayson tries a balloon called lung tester on ollie lacks punch the scenario is very episodic with the first part taking place in the boys' apartment almost completely unrelated to the second part where they go off to sea but on the whole the film is highly pleasant entertainment with a sufficiently brief running time so that it doesn't wear out it's welcome br br there's a certain poignancy viewing the final collaboration between laurel and hardy and producer hal roach i haven't seen all of laurel and hardy's post 1940 films but those that i have seen don't measure up to even the weakest hal roach products in these later movies laurel and hardy seem to be in an alien environment deprived of such colorful supporting players like finlayson and charlie hall and marvin hately and leroy shield's sprightly musical scores they also aren't the well meaning and optimistic bumblers we know and love but in the later films are either exasperating blockheads or pathetic misfits br br it is a pity that many hal roach laurel and hardy films are now generally unavailable to the public even in a minor entry like saps at sea one can see that laurel and hardy were great comedians this was because hal roach for the most part allowed stan laurel the guiding force behind the team complete artistic freedom once laurel lost his autonomy at other studios the team lost much of its uniqueness
<START> no doubt intended as a totally campy joke full moon high portrays 1950s teenager tony walker adam arkin accompanying his father ed mcmahon on a trip to romania sure enough tony gets bitten and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse and that he has to fulfill a destiny even if it takes twenty years br br but otherwise the movie's just plain funny once it gets going ed mcmahon's character is an over patriotic right wing yahoo he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy kenneth mars's coach principal is a tense dweeb and then there's more one of the most eye opening cast members is demond wilson best remembered as lamont on sanford and son as a bus driver who gets a big surprise but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents then gag with gerald ford really summed him up anyway it's a real treat considering that alan arkin who plays a zany psychiatrist just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons i wonder whether or not he remembers co starring with two of them in this movie aside from adam his son anthony also has a small role quite funny also starring elizabeth hartman br br ps director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick it's alive
<START> why oh why don't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point everyone in the cinema young and old was there to see talking animals make jokes and whilst they did that we were all happy and then as with lost in space came the two killer blows plot and sentiment who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether eddie murphy made up with his daughter not me that's for sure
<START> years ago i found a bargain bin copy of this film for a buck or two in so many ways this is quite fitting as when it was made back in 1933 it was truly a cheaply made film by the poverty row studio majestic however while the film is rather derivative it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises br br the story is very very familiar as in some germanic town the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires adding to this familiarity is dwight frye he played renfield in dracula and here he is very very similar though he plays a much more harmless weirdo in this case he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths the film does a good job of providing some red herrings i e false leads and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film in addition while the production had little money to speak of it still had some good actors of the day lionel atwill and melvin douglas and it also used universal studios sets at night when they were done filming for the day as a result the film looks pretty good overall though i also thought that as usual fay wray was terrible thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth she always seems to be cast as the screaming lady and provides little new in each film br br overall for fans of old horror films this is excellent and worth seeing for people who are not fans of the genre it's probably pretty skip able
<START> to put it simply i enjoyed this film the reason for my interest enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself i had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how northern england working class life and attitudes used to be as experienced by them and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me in particular the paternalistic but overbearing father who knows what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged not much has changed there then br br people who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media in a sense however the film is an historical document and i personally enjoyed it if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon
<START> this movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours al pacino michelle phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable the violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film the ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever great movie and you will probably really enjoy it
<START> as good an advert for republicanism as you're ever likely to see mayerling is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria set during one of europe's seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph mr james mason his rebellious son the crown prince rudolf mr omar sharif the empress miss ava gardner and various mistresses secret policemen spies extravagantly uniformed popinjays gypsies dancers wives soldiers swans horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph's austro hungarian empire filmed in what the old movie posters used to call a riot of color it resembles nothing more than an expensively dressed but intellectually challenged production of the student prince mr james mason wearing a very natty little white number utilises his all purpose mittel european accent whenever he remembers i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing mr omar sharif who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince he is utterly unconvincing as a man who in the movie at least cut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy with his well buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes unhappily married he falls in love with a commoner forbidden love is one of the movie's come ons as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it particularly in the sequence set at the ballet now i love ballet as much as the next man but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time a more cynical critic might consider it to be padding rudolf's mother the empress is played by miss ava gardner she gives the part some good old american oooomph making her a bit like auntie mame but it's done with undeniable style rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother i'll put it no more strongly than that the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt sorry edward prince of wales he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it's a joy to behold i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question what's the bleeding time i am not qualified to dispute mayerling 's historical accuracy but in my opinion everything else about it is risible it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling
<START> literally every aspect of this science fiction low budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect attack of the sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction the cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats br br special effects wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful just as you'd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock br br the plot and characters are just as horrendous we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt and take it very very seriously even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved or were they sent to do it i don't know i could barely follow the film but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even so they went too far for normal br br attack of the sabretooth is a very poor film even for a low budget sci fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example it will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through and keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so it's not suppose to be comical
<START> i watched it some years ago i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich br br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price please br br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happy br br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs this may not be casualty br br i think that the title is a hope about life you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible br br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall but four things really stand out sam raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy man alan arkin's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner and best of all the cinematography the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories br br the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable some reviewers criticise the lack of a more profound script to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to them br br the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right
<START> i've seen about 820 movies released between 1931 39 and the informer is the worst major release i've seen from that time span awful despicable unpleasant unhappy unredeemable saga of a complete loser watch a 1934 b western instead
<START> this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time br br the running man is one of arnold s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie it also has jesse ventura the legendary professor toru tanaka sven ole thorsen the beautiful maria conchita alonso yaphet kotto kurt fuller richard dawson and thomas rosales jr who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder the lost world robo cop 2 predator 2 and among others all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of arnold s best to date
<START> saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated hated hated it easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie just long long silences with people unable to articulate what they are presumably feeling if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this yes leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss
