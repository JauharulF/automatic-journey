<START> this is a great movie i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie one of the best things in the movie is that helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to arnold that was great i loved it it was pretty funny too it's a great movie doy
<START> this movie was very enjoyable though you'll only like it if you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk you love horror movies br br i particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character the fact that he's totally obsessed by cleanliness especially in the mouth and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud covered pool man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard br br liked it i give it an 8
<START> well this film is a difficult one really to be straight with you this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story nore does it make u 'want' to know how it'll end but i'll tell you something now never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills to be fair i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why i was jumpy or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect it's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors i think it's it's the sister of the main character and she brings along her husband during the night the husband hears noises checks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrong they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn't right to cut a long story short eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of br br it's not a hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please don't let that put you off it's creepy tense and very very jumpy just give it a try
<START> if you are used to seeing gabriel byrne in serious roles such as tom in millers crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film even if you are not a fan of gabriel byrne in particular all the actors in this film give really great performances if you've got about eleven bucks that is close to nine quid i say order it online or rent it from you favorite movie rental place guaranteed to make you laugh whether or not you normally like gangster type movies mad dog time trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget and find yourself watching over and over you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it
<START> based on the novel by michael chabon the mysteries of pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends the year is 1983 and young art bechstein jon foster is at a crossroads completely opposed to his father's lifestyle art plans to become a stockbroker visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography the whole film feels like the director whose previous effort dodgeball was funny if outright commercial is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like mena suvari sienna miller and nick nolte like so many of the star laden premieres at sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right
<START> so it has come to this fast expensive cars that only the upper 1 will ever drive the girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines second tier and no name actors cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture br br this is the garbage that hollywood has to offer don't get me wrong i love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy but please will the collective braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop count to ten breathe have a hearty woooooosaaaaaah then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time then actually make some movies like that again br br i have nothing against poker but the entire pop culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous everyone and their mother thinks their maverick now not that half of them even will get that reference some executive said hey what demographic do you want to leach 9 50 out of i know sir the 18 35 market ok let's give them poker girls and fast cars brilliant idea sir the result a film that i've seen a hundred times late at night on spike tv and more often than not starring dolph lundgren br br now don't misunderstand me i am not a film snob over the top artsy flicks like the english patient don't float my boat but generic films that should not have even been made straight to dvd bother the hell out of me too only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this and i imagine the ones in the higher end of their iq range will see this for what it is a junkyard
<START> this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person whats more is that this is a true story br br antwone fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women coke cigars weed alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up br br there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent the only rating i can give it is a 10 10
<START> watching john cassavetes film opening night i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn't be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy otherwise as he said what am i doing i couldn't help but think of his words when watching gena rowland's character myrtle gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes' film of course since it's about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theater br br near the beginning of the film after exiting a performance myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle it's a touching little moment but it doesn't last as she has to get in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she's not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she's sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it's out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and can't seem to stand being hit she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to myrtle is all to real until she's suddenly gone br br cassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this isn't exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes doesn't tell them how to get from a to b in a scene and he doesn't need to there's a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera work you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isn't with the plot but she's haunted and is unsatisfied with her character's lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her too br br the question soon becomes though not what is the usual a conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'will she be able to go on stage will the show go on ' this isn't important for cassavetes even if it's there as is the question 'will she be alright ' perhaps going through such a grueling play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the play's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it's expected doesn't mean it's any duller than woman under the influence if anything it's just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren't easy br br one of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it's apparently a real play and we only know slightly what it's about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the improvisation of the actors i wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed he's on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen br br it's funny startling chilling and edge of your seat stuff some of the best theater on film scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does 'acting' mean
<START> this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies aren't a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs i'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on imdb
<START> this movie is just so good despite carmen electra this has to be one of the better films i have seen in awhile jamie kennedy is just amazing and loren dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well the plot is great as well it's all very real which is scary it says here that it's a drama but this is one of the damn funniest dramas i have ever seen go check it out
<START> if the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music they succeeded with me commonplace human situations became original personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie without spoiling i can say that i was very moved by the movie's approach to living haven't actually cried out of what joy empathy just deep emotion in a very long time i would love to find a way to show it to others saw it at seattle international film festival
<START> secret sunshine marks the return of director lee changdong to the film making world after a multi year absence having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt he recruits now veteran thespian jeon doyeon and her considerable cannes winning talents for the primary role of lee shinae what follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms br br one of the things that becomes apparent while watching secret sunshine is that it doesn't really care to follow any specific genre but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey the story itself follows lee shinae as she moves with her son to the city of milyang whose sino corean translates to secret sunshine she moves to milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown so the film is born from tragedy and you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice guy mechanic jongchan played by song kangho but this isn't a romantic comedy br br as we and jongchan doggedly follow shinae as she encounters milyang and the fate that it has in store for her the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent she is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough secret sunshine still manages to follow a mostly aristotelian dramatic arc but pulls back on the catharsis which might confound some viewers especially the ending but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of milyang the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied once i started to think over the film some more br br ms jeon is rather impressive throughout especially considering that if the role were any less well played it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama but she captures the nuances of shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety mr song has a much smaller role in this film than other films but he performs adequately appropriately giving stage to ms jeon technically the film is well done in a classical sense no flashy aesthetics are employed here the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself i think my only real complaint and one that might not be able to be fixed is that despite all the time we spend with shinae there is a bit of distance between shinae and the audience or at least me i think some of this stems from the nature of the work because if total empathy were pushed then we wouldn't be able to see the problems that shinae has objectively on the other hand i never felt moved along with shinae's plight despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior br br all the same the film still stands quite impressive especially in that it stimulated me to think about it the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy coping self deception isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running propelled by a strong lead performance i honestly didn't notice its 2 25 hour runtime and that says something well done 8 10
<START> i am amazed with some of the reviews of this film the only place that seems to tell the truth is rottentomatoes com this film is awful the plot is extremely lazy it is not scary either people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it this film is more like dark water except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it i was extremely disappointed with this film it didn't scare me nor interest me either let's face it this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e g the dead trying to contact the living dragonfly what lies beneath ghost story dark water darkness the changeling etc etc it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans the films that are coming out of hollywood like this are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer they're just being churned out
<START> this was the first televised episode of the columbo series although it was filmed after death lends a hand and it heralded one of the most successful tv series in history br br jack cassidy who played the murderer in the series three times enthuses smugness arrogance and self assuredness in equal measure here as ken franklin one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner jim ferris played by martin milner who decides to terminate their professional relationship leaving franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer br br the initial murder set up is fantastic and cassidy's performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best columbo murderer in the series br br peter falk is wonderfully understated in his role as columbo and the character's inherent traits and oddities which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent mindedness contrast particularly well with cassidy's character's extreme smugness one of their early scenes together where ken franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through jim ferris's non existent expo see of identifying hit men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well franklin hints to columbo this potential motive and columbo purposely or ignorantly fails to latch on forcing franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books mrs melville br br also noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old steven spielberg notwithstanding some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode one particularly stark image is of jim feriss's dead body lying on the settee almost dark in the foreground as ken franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to ferris's distraught wife i have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10 14 day schedule spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated br br unfortunately the event of the second murder necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of franklin's and ironically referred to as sloppy by columbo in his climatic summing up takes the steam out of the whole thing the cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen time between falk and cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script writer stephen bocho out of a tight corner since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder br br the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode the initial banter and exchange of words between falk and cassidy is strongly and effectively executed but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode the main aggravation lies with the sealing clue if it can be called a clue cassidy's character's hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt and once this is mentioned he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion br br all in all a bold opening to the series which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about columbo and conversely the problems associated with such ingenuity i e maintaining the high standards and particularly creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending
<START> i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing i mean there was nothing scary about this movie it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious i think they shoudln't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs jason although some parts were gross like the head blowing up and any elm street film from 1 5 sucked this was the best besides number 1 i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you'll laugh alot i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary freddy's dead the final nightmare overall grade b
<START> i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of mine br br for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress and then br br i don't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadn't been in years and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it br br i believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink this film did that it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever had br br br br
<START> i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people maggie smith a very young bob newhart and of course peter ustinov my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesn't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist' part of the film to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe and here is problem one his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras the second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinov's ditsy next door neighbor secretary who just can't keep a job i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here too composed the part called for more of a wacky physical comedian furthermore ustinov and smith have no chemistry together maybe it's the age difference but the later romantic relationship as devoid of actual romance as it is still comes off a little creepy ustinov co wrote the script and it was thought well of at the time but i found it unfunny meandering and a sad waste of a great cast
<START> i have given this show i have only watched seven episodes four stars because most of her jokes set ups appear to fail some are not funny outright but some are amusing in a 12 year old boy kind of way she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a canvas calls it art and sells it for a lot of money silverman throws out what she's got including the kitchen sink while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different br br however what she's got often times is not enough as though she lacks the kind of follow through a good comedian needs to succeed br br the whole enterprise is like an under done potato
<START> this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'the prsoner of zenda' set in a london that only hollywood could manage atmospheric but nothing like the real thing it is a story of obsession and thwarted love from the novel by somerset maughan br br i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones so i bought it well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh bette davis was one of the greatest film actors make no mistake but here she did make one it was impossible to take her character seriously it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke 'mary poppins' cockney accent but close br br in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well worth watching despite ms davis' vocal gymnastics
<START> profanity stupidity self indulgence and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie making pesci's attempt to prove my cousin vinny was no fluke shows the opposite instead he is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead a true must miss
