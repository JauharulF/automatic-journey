<START> spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title the fury of the wolf man and there have been many home video versions of it over the years if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most workable edition i've seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps and it's an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from fury's print it is also letterboxed br br naschy plays waldemar daninsky returning home from a trip to tibet only to find out that he's contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant apparently the doc attempts to tame the werewolf and there is a very strange sado masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged daninsky who is under her trance at least in the original version ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as daninsky battles a she wolf br br the biggest problem with the movie is that the director according to naschy's claims was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy it's not quite as difficult to make out what's going on though the editing remains atrocious in spots worst of all is occasional non matching footage of naschy's ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film la marc del hombre lobo aka frankenstein's bloody terror and mixed into this one without any sensible reason the wolf's clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again as does his demeanor one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from fury next he is growling and running around savagely from bloody terror really bizarre
<START> xizao is a rare little movie it is simple and undemanding and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them br br the aging patriarch master liu is a relic of china's pre expansion days he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out unhappy people not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting br br master liu's mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modern life brother the interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heart felt with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies br br with its regime critical message this movie was not only censored but also given unreasonably small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet you can't help getting suspicious br br so help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share
<START> attack force has a horrendous title and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover because the film is horrible a mish mash of plot lines a choppy mess and a horribly stagnated pace make the film hard to watch start to finish i managed this and i'm proud as a fan of seagal's work mostly of his old days it's painful to see him star in such tripe true seagal's last half dozen movies or so have sucked a lot but some of them at least had some redeeming features attack force is a mess from conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes from an alien plot line to the current one about a highly addictive super drug about to be unleashed on the romanian the film has several settings none of which are romanian but all look like romania because they are in romania populace the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was plot holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure that's been a problem in seagal's last few films as well but never has the result been so boring there's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with ctx that's the drugs cool name that is never resolved br br of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments especially the action before i regard the action though all the other departments are poor the direction is poor or perhaps better put made to look poor who knows how director michael keusch originally intended this film between him finishing his job the re shoots by stunt man tom delmar and the editing a coherent auteur vision is completely lost the best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop the cinematography is dull nearly inducing sleep while the droning score sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers does nothing to excite matters the cast too are poor unable to salvage anything here seagal looks bored beyond recognition and is dubbed through much of the picture clearly when plot points are being changed he looks tired and overweight and lethargic unlike he's looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in seagal's recent pictures the only redeemable cast member is adam croasdell as one of the villains doing a slimy brit routine he seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line because he's playing it inhuman he seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion seemingly waiting for her husbandÂ dracula br br finally the action well it's poor poorly conceived poorly shot there's not much either and there's even less featuring seagal stevo doesn't really bring out the stunt double here because there's so little to do there's even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that inter cuts occasionally with little flashes of seagal's stand in because clearly seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit but from what i understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in seagal will apparently not be working with these people again or with castel studio's who continue to deliver horrifically sub nu image that's saying something material br br overall this is one to avoid if you are not a seagal fan seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again unfortunately his next film which has already been shot with the same people promises to be even worse than this
<START> this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing just because you've got an excellent ensemble cast doesn't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp think about it the film featured richard widmark lauren bacall charles boyer gloria graham lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film the basic premise of the film isn't bad a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients also the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife widmark and graham had a lot of promise however the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film in fact it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of general hospital subtle this film ain't realistic this film ain't br br while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors for example paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent especially when playing gangsters in film noir movies yet here stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accent it just didn't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one dimensional also charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarre br br overall this is a rather awful film it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn't very pretty my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent br br ps in a case of art imitating life oscar levant played one of the patients in real life the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions
<START> the arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir and how people in it gradually change this movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes it'a about bringing out the best in people and kay pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for the actors are outstanding michael nyqvist we know before but frida hallgren was an new and charming acquaintances to me she has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched per moberg does his part as gabriella's husband almost too well he is awful too see one only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well br br this is a movie that will not leave you untouched if you haven't already seen it do it today
<START> this is a very good under rated action drama and slightly historical movie br br the basic story concerns rob roy's borrowing of 1000 pounds its theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen br br cunningham tim roth is an amazing villain and character in this story brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil br br rob roy liam neeson is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour 1 too many times br br the rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed br br the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory the story is good and you really want rob to win br br all in all just shy of a classic
<START> what of domino did i hate over everything and i mean everything else perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe it's the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like kiera knightly who if you buy as a bounty hunter then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012 br br nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is 'was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy ' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely don't know how to react to whether they're supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question 'is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs ' i don't think so br br the film opens with the title card 'based on a true story sort of ' if that's supposed to be some sort of post modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then you're simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of domino's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the 'sort of' cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by reality's dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of her goldfish br br we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey rourke domino knightley herself and would be love interest choco ramÃ­rez during the scene an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at innocents we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs br br the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of 'no why are you doing this why is this happening ' bad seeds are planted and wouldn't you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210 here is another daft post modernist slant people playing themselves and that 'sort of' joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr's natural born killers character br br so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco's gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver's registration i ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any 'feeling' between choco and domino it exists on such a small tiny minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included br br so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative wise we find out the reason for the fake i ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded he must've swam really quickly Â double the speed of the film's fasted edit which means something in the region of 01 of a second yeah sure the film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up plus there's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film's comedy runs so dry that it has to resort to the jerry jerry chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show when did we last laugh at jerry jerry when we were say seven years old i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence
<START> spoilers br br this is one bad movie seriously acting in absolutely horrible the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful but hey its so bad that its fun watching the script is so bad that its enjoyable you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as i guess thats what you call crocteasing as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad it has such horrible jokes that they're funny but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap i really started to fall asleep trust me though the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do heh heh mindless movie which has to be nominated for the mst3k line
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed for many of ollie's pre stan films he was billed on screen as babe hardy and throughout his adult life hardy was known to his friends as 'babe' while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music hall act for bernard delfont hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname early in his acting career hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardy's plump cheeks the ones on his face and said 'nice baby ' hardy's workmates started crying him 'babe' and the nickname stuck br br although much of hardy's pre laurel work is very interesting notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west his teamwork with billy ruge who in a series of low budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt names which are unpleasant in their own right but made worse because ruge although shorter than hardy isn't especially a runt seen here hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache br br 'one too many' an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic is direly unfunny and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'that's my wife' one of laurel and hardy's most hilarious films plump hardy is the star boarder in a rooming house run by a tall gawky landlady runt ruge is the porter plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john whose dosh he expects to inherit his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plump's wife and baby there's only one problem plump hasn't got a wife and baby he's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man now of course plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice of course the results are disastrous it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny but they aren't most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs br br spoilers coming vim director will louis who shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame this could be funny if done on purpose but it's merely inept at one point in this bad comedy an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress 'surely they wouldn't stoop that low for a laugh ' i thought but they do runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as plump's progeny br br somehow plump acquires an infant's cot but he still hasn't got a baby with uncle john coming up the stairs plump conscripts runt for babyhood this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget or even with a truly runt sized actor such as chester conklin but billy ruge is only slightly below average height ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it amazingly he does br br the most notable aspect of 'one too many' is a brief appearance apparently her only ever film appearance by madelyn saloshin oliver hardy's first wife the marriage was not a happy one although hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurel's br br only one thing in this movie impressed me there is a very brief flashback sequence with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty in 1916 there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done gracefully and simply too bad this movie has no other merits 'one too many' is definitely one film too many on oliver hardy's cv and i'll rate this movie just one point out of 10 laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately
<START> carnosaur 3 primal species 1996 d jonathan winfrey scott valentine janet gunn rick dean anthony peck rodger halston terri j vaughn billy burnette why even bother reviewing this movie another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal and very fake looking prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways the original was bad enough the sequel was even worse this falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films rating 2 out of 10 rated r for graphic violence and gore grisly images and profanity
<START> this movie truly captures the feeling of freedom and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth in the most delightful light hearted way not a serious but hilarious adventure br br the story mirrors life we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we wanted which results in us getting more than we thought we would get you will get this once you see the movie br br and this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one's life br br it is one of my all time favorites not easy to find but worth the hunt i guarantee you will watch it more than once

<START> tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing tarzan br br this is a rarity a sequel that's better than the original tarzan the ape man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was 1934 there's also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and it's implied they sleep together and have sex without being married this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme br br that aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan everybody else is ok br br this is easily the best weismuller o'hara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids
<START> casting unknown michelle rodriguez as diana was a stroke of genius she's perfect her acting inexperience actually works in her favor we've never seen her before so it really feels like her story she also brings across genuine toughness this works against her though because we never doubt her you never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat so as a boxing movie it fails br br then again this isn't really a boxing movie how do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie you don't but karyn kusama has anyway like many indie films girlfight defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life br br diana is doing poorly in school she beats up people she doesn't like all the other girls in her school for example she doesn't fit in her father is forcing her kid brother tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough he gives tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives diana nothing as if she has no need to defend herself nor anything worthwhile to make of her life tiny wants to go to art school cliche' yuck so he gives up his boxing allowance to diana who actually wants to box things get complicated when diana falls for another boxer adrian santiago douglas who's looking to turn pro from there the story winds down toward the inevitable the two meet in the amateur title fight br br what left me cold was that i never found any of this all that interesting it's all just a bit too believable kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports a lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances the mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing where anger is your friend so this time it's a girl big deal br br or there's another position to take finally a boxing movie about a girl women's boxing has been around a long time the brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings the whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture respect overcoming adversity self discovery br br i recommend girlfight because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director the dialogue never rises above soap opera quality but the story itself actually changed my view on some things yes the world now seems like a better place a film did that br br grade b
<START> the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle definitely not one of johns best movies don't get me wrong with any john wayne move there is always some good spots and this one has it's fair share but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn't live up to the aspirations it could have been bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers br br this would be a good family move to watch with your children just be aware there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it maybe it's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work
<START> ordinarily i really enjoy movies like chances are but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body played by robert downey jr he meets up with his wife cybill shepherd and friend ryan o'neal and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated but from there the film goes downhill there are several sex related scenes that turned me off completely especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now after that however the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible considering the circumstances of the plot i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end there was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher but ultimately the film is not great for a better similar film try heaven can wait decent but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half br br out of
<START> when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying first of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every clichÃ© possible you can guess not only the general plot but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there on the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most ostensible manner the actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that will use a limited set of acting skills the i am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is ours body posture while the bad guys have the i'm a bad one frowning and the you caught me look followed by the i'm good for nothing and i should be removed from society head banding this kind of also sums up the general development of each show true story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers don't give a s t about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you
<START> the movie itself was ok for the kids but i gotta tell ya that scratch the little squirrel was the funniest character i've ever seen he makes the movie all by himself he's the reason i've just love this movie congradulations to the crew it made me laugh out loud and always will
<START> and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on i've seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d kman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen that's it that's the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch there's a bag lady beauty contest in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won't be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who's saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they're regarded as stuck up squares i just saw white chicks recently that's another low brow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it's not funny what the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from there's something about mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list the joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off ben's ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy thing's not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let's face it nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjective but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan's fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i don't think she's done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the film's biggest star keeping in mind duncan wasn't famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her for good reason usually i'm in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesn't become a cult classic shouldn't there be a law against distributing crap like this
