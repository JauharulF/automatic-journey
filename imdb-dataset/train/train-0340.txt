<START> but there are not too many of them probably the worst major release film i have seen in my life definitely the worst for this year there is no point in commenting on the plot the cast or the acting the problem is beyond all that it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind not the funny kind of everything that takes place on the screen i don't know why i gave it a 2 10 instead of 1 10 probably because of steven martini he really did try bottom line 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells avoid at any cost
<START> there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick's abundance of clichÃ©s throughout and i agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialog br br i'd read about elizabeth berkly's awful performance in the equally awful showgirls which i've never seen and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of lifetime's worse fare there was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldn't have been if so it would have placed the film completely out of balance since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayal br br the principal's handling of liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest gump attacking jenny's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentally challenged br br the smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession br br finally and frankly i rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that you'd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most real like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order series' and the like but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on lifetime br br finally i found a kind of story within a story fascination with josh's concoction of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from f to f minus br br this whole lame situation should have been resolved in real life in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hour's blank film in the camera br br but the writer s here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption br br this one's a 2 presentation the second because it does have some mild fascination
<START> this one is out there not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality i can see why this film was banned for so long the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film it's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films i came across this film on the net that i thought i might check out i enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time something you don't rarely see in films today
<START> jammin' the blues is an oscar nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam marie bryant sings the sunny side of the street at one point for the film's highlight then jitterbugs with archie savage to bring this most entertaining jam session to its exciting end the director gojn mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the '40s according to some notes i read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time what a shame still this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube so if you love jazz i suggest you seek it out there
<START> i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous the collection works as intended it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions working as an intellectual hommage never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee jerk reactionism br br there have been many allegations made that the film is anti american while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue people make much noise about the egyptian segment by chahine because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are fair targets for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack but this ignores much else in the piece several perspectives are discussed no one being held up as the truth and critics if they even saw the piece seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy br br pretty much all of the films are beautiful thoughtful inspiring in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf tanovic loach inarritu nair good as usual effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti islam hysteria that swept and still sweeps the states i did find gitai's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism and penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes though i had expected to like it borgnine is very good and brave in it spoiler warning one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what because light floods his room keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize again this is a sort of impressionistic piece for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man's flat then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash not light flooding through his window
<START> certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most pre star wars science fiction it tends to take too long admiring itself br br but still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic tonalities to provide the musical score robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from c3po to data br br the plot line of course is shakespeare's the tempest morbius is prospero and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first
<START> i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk well actually it doesn't because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't original creative quirky and humorous it seems that today no one really wants to see this type of movie as in the simplest terms it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film br br i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes essentially it is about nothing as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise en scene consists of half a house and a vast white empty space this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles br br i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed fashion with the combination of good performances a strong script nice sound design and fairly impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie br br it's just a shame so few people know about nothing
<START> the 14 year old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that they're all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden compass which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year stardust based on a novel by neil gaiman showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials the critical reaction is kind of blah i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend well if you'll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly aligned because i went to see stardust and i loved it it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest the hero sets out to look for a fallen star filled with obstacles but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance and it succeeds wonderfully there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one there's a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent it isn't a masterpiece but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre
<START> this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick but youv'e seen it a million times before
<START> this movie is truly brilliant it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you don't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past but it doesn't stop there this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like there's no tomorrow and the way he swung it i really am amazed there was a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut don't miss this movie it's a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody mindedness and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another 5 to make a sequel
<START> imagine its say 12 1am your at home your bored your not tired this scenario occurred about say 4 or so years back i turned on the tv and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen a runaway car that cant be stopped cos the brakes have been cut or something in caning it down the freeway whats gonna happen this film was so bad its actually funny i think the stunts cost about 2 to make there was one instance where a baby small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter in an attempt to excite the viewer a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead this is the best bad bit of a film ever it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used total low budget classic cant remember the end of the film though but i bet it was great br br i doubt they will ever show this film again so i'm glad i got to see this piece of trash
<START> the bloodsucker leads the dance what a laughable title it's so utterly misleading it's not surprising that the film makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie br br the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island br br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice artists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial level morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voice artists cannot be blamed for the script it's a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious br br the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few half hearted severed head shots br br a few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it it's basically a soft core porn film with a horror angle but it's not very erotic either br br i can't recommend this to anyone
<START> this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clichÃ©s you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly unerotic one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23 year old yvonne's dance as sexual it's merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywood's turkeys this is for you i bought the colorized version on vhs making the movie even worse yvonne's heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and she's the best part of this film what a way to launch a career
<START> i'm not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice over which states the u s has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7 1945 to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close br br 1 the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion br br 2 the average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these unholy fill in the blanks flicks created in their own head for free instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store or on cable br br 3 this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne
<START> etienne girardot is just a character actor the sort of person people almost never would know by name however he once again plays the coroner one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once i've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride including grant mitchell gene lockhart henry walthal kent smith h b warner and nat pendleton this is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce br br these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b movies while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the breezy writing and acting the films really satisfy as for this film vance is played wonderfully by lowe but like i said the mystery itself is only an after thought with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides unfortunately you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film i would have done it used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets br br overall while not the best philo vance film it was very good and it's a darn shame lowe only played this role once in fact aside from william powell who played vance five times the series was hindered by a long long succession of actors such as basil rathbone wilfred hyde white and warren william and many others playing vance this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series just too many different actors playing the leading man br br well worth seeing and exciting though also quite impossible
<START> silverlake life is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward actually it was more like a home movie and if you want dramatic illuminations see something else and it's by no means a tearjerker but i mean that in positive ways it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every day lives it's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond it's an admirable film actually one of the most admirable sincere documents i've ever seen these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts it makes hollow wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless these men made this movie for themselves which is one of the best reasons to create something the scene where tom sings you are my sunshine to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing
<START> bo is jane parker whose long lost anthropologist father richard harris in the worst role of a very inconsistent career is in africa studying something or another she tracks him down how and he tells her of the natives' stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle turns out to be the ape man himself miles o'keeffe who has the film's best dialogue who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers normally i'm very open minded to varying opinions about any film but this is the sole exception this is the worst film ever made if you don't agree you haven't seen it notes newsday called it unendurable which is the best one word summary i can think of the maltin movie guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than bomb
<START> an accurate review of nuremburg must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie valkyrie tom cruise valkyrie 2008 at long last tells the world there was a german resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats military generals soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the nazi political regime install a new chancellor obtain peace and close the concentration camps however these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the french resistance just next door history writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the german people completely supported the nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing genocide and unconditional surrender that was imposed on the germans br br the german enigma codes were broken by english scientists in 1943 so much of what the germans were doing was known during 1943 the germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including arado heinkel and messerschmitt however even if the nazis were eliminated and the german resistance succeeded the allies wouldn't allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters jet bombers high speed submarines ballistic missiles and radio guided missiles without the usa having them first this is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant consequently the german resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate adolf hitler the 20 july 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the germans to obtain peace instead the germans got ultimatums of unconditional surrender and 24 hour saturation bombing in an agenda to avoid peace the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans and contain complete ownership through an unconditional surrender it was a premeditated allied agenda to allow the war to perpetuate and keep the nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after d day before allied armies advanced into germany to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun however tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the german resistance for their own greed br br the allies imposed unconditional surrender on the germans as a pretext to complete ownership and control of german property and government and it was done without using the german resistance to over throw the nazis the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans to achieve world technological supremacy consequently everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of german people in the 24 hour bombing the concentration camps stayed open the war was prolonged and led to the cold war with weapons based on german industrial achievements technology and scientists taken from the germans in world war two br br the 1946 nuremburg war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder perpetrated by the allies as retrospective justice to the nazis it was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the german resistance overthrow the nazi political regime br br tens of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the german resistance to an agenda but they inflicted retribution against the german chiefs of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at nuremburg war crimes or not although the allies had perpetrated genocide to achieve world technological supremacy
<START> the silent one panel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios billed as the world's funniest human in this dull little cartoon betty long past her prime thanks to the production code is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long five minutes a bore
<START> this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies poltergeist the legacy i'm not so sure it may have been loosely connected to the movies it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it br br it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents in the 1st episode i believe and the amount of parents were disappointing with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies you'd expect there to be more parents but oh well br br freddy is basically the narrator for the show he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved br br the acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone 4 more movies came after the series so it wasn't a total loss
