<START> do not waste your time or your money on this movie my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad it was i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself i honestly feel emotionally scarred it went from being a semi low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick and really not a good one i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him almost all in all an awful movie that was definitely rated nc 17 for a reason don't waste your money and don't let your kids watch it
<START> othello the classic shakespearen story of love betrayal lies and tragedy i remember studying this story in high school actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship love and racism perfectly i mean when you really do study this story you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness br br othello is the big time soldier in his city he is loved by everyone including the king but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter desdemona the king is infuriated but excepts it othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend cassio his side man instead of iago who has stood by othello due to his insane jealousy he's out for revenge still pretending to be othello's best friend he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio never says that they are just makes othello think that it's happening othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out br br othello is an incredible story i highly recommend that you read it it's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him this is a terrific movie great acting good sets and good direction this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story br br 10 10
<START> what can you say about this movie it was not terrible but it was not good two days earlier i had watched lillies and that was one of the best gay films i have ever seen so this was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay flick br br the story was silly and the acting was ok it was not bad enough to turn off but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping it was not very well cast either br br would i recommend this movie no you would be wasting your time and money i don't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them spend your time watching noah's arc on logo instead i think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there
<START> this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000 but when i see this film i don't think about that wonderful tv series i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would be brides an old hag and her two bizarre sons one a giant idiot the other a comical dwarf angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter who is kind of a stereotype but still fun to watch my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie i don't want to spoil any of this film so go out and rent it or better yet buy it for a couple of bucks
<START> gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made but not the bad kind of bad movies this one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting he should go back to gymnastics but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion i don't think it was meant to be this bad but who can tell it's not art but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation rent gymakta makes for an evening of fun
<START> watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes there are a million options to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop br br there aren't many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative cliche's make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as leak as a sieve etc that makes this movie a waste of time and money br br
<START> i watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago i still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity the first few scenes alone were hilarious i won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it i wouldn't want to ruin the laughs needless to say the entire time i watched this movie i was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off there is no plot and not a trace of decent acting the characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten learn to read book they even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting
<START> two thirds of nearly 2 000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes was this a record or merely a faulty vcr although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim's original book my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing although in no way syrupy and was also very well written i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film and so decided to buy her the videotape i am now very glad that i did and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre mussolini italian atmosphere the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together away from their families in a rented villa in italy force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or man made disasters or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved films br br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book effectively unrolled before my eyes perhaps italy itself has some part in this the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccio's decameron on tv generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story great credit is due to the director mike newell and all members of the cast particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies
<START> james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting br br we meet a selection of gamblers gun fighters indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles bank heists etc the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief br br the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop throw in some good old western action fist fights shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure 8 10
<START> los debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to santiago from the south after their mother dies the confident and streetwise silvio the elder brother gets a job working for a sleazy strip club's owner after taking the naive victor there for his 17th birthday br br as silvio blossoms under his boss's tutelage both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress gracia as the film unfolds characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one manipulates the next br br the film is well made with good cinematography and fast pacing it's also pretty sexy with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes it uses the now popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view out of chronological sequence many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on memento pulp fiction reservoir dogs and many other good films use this device the plot itself is really nothing new there are elements of body heat pulp fiction and many other good film noir br br as the different layers are revealed our understandings of the characters and their motivations evolve while the plot may be somewhat clichÃ© it is also clever and entertaining br br i would call it an enjoyable movie worth watching but nothing memorable i haven't seen many films from chile and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries other than that rent it if it's available but don't lose any sleep if it isn't
<START> i won't argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable as is january jones's performance but please check her out if you haven't already in the amc tv series 'mad men starting later this month she's excellent as is the entire cast i'll charitably assume she took on the taboo role strictly for the money and realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation don't know if that's the case but i now know for sure that she can act br br at first watching taboo i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot no such luck hard to believe the director didn't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw br br ironically her winning performance in mad men comes as a character who at least in her early appearances is very repressed reserved unsure of herself and rather colorless not unlike her taboo role but as the tv series progressed she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early 60's whitebread mom role can't wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd season br br to sum up avoid taboo like leprosy but definitely check out mad men
<START> i was greatly moved when i watched the movie how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want and fuss about all the things they don't have and they are such small things like chothes money a new car i've seen people in tears because of a blemish this movie brings everything back to the basics love hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food a roof over your head and your loved ones around you you are truly blessed and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith strenght and humor with me thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above
<START> this film was absolutely awful i even feel uncomfortable calling it a film its the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out i have tried to give mumblecore a chance but lets be honest its just horrible br br i am not out of sync with cinema i appreciate dogme95 films idioterne is one of my all time favorite films so i do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some any substance br br everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing or was it all improvised the direction but most of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense the camera was never anywhere logical there was no consistency i got to admit being a guy i had heard there was nudity in this film so i thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity yea i know i'm a jerk well thanks to the uber crappy camera work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see trust me you do not want to see this film made me want to vomit on numerous levels br br the dialogue made me want to vomit the camera work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit
<START> zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i don't typically go for military war movies but this was worth my time br br it was serious but it was also humorous beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that he's got your back br br zane's character developed throughout the film he wasn't just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun br br the ending through me a little though it didn't really go with the action throughout the film but i'm glad that i saw it nonetheless br br it's worth checking out
<START> lily powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies she then goes to new york to work at an office building there she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want and what men want is her well you know alfred e green's baby face 1933 is a movie of high sexual content for a movie of that era anyway this was one of the last pre code films that were made barbara stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as lily other actors of this film include george brent courtland trenholm donald cook ned stevens alphonse ethier adolf cragg henry kolker j p carter margaret lindsay ann carter and theresa harris chico the young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy jr this movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good baby face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch
<START> although i really enjoyed jim carrey's latest serious performances the truman show man on the moon i've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy this is not to say he is a fantastic talented actor those bozos at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much he has never had a truly deserved nomination or award well any institution that nominates for 11 oscars a bore such as titanic shouldn't be taken seriously br br on with the review the grinch is the sweetest best looking best acted more enjoyable seasons film since the nightmare before christmas both movies seem very similar too with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas both make their principal actors seem like the villains one in a higher degree than the other both pack a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable br br that is until you realize that jack skellington is a doll and the grinch is a human being but a human being that is so incredibly expressive so fluid in his movements so cartoon like so unreal that never gets in the way of the movie he can be hilarious he can be a sad soul he can be angry he lives in a 3 dimensional world where 3 dimensional people live he jokes he laughs he cries and ultimately he saves the christmas i loved this film to bits and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd this is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 20 years from now as timeless as they come
<START> shamefull as it may be this movie actually made it to the videomarket bringing shame on my proud country any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing will be a fruitless attempt one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this then having either fallen asleep or visited the bathroom for puking br br note if you haven't seen anything else from denmark please remember this br br some things were never meant to be but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway
<START> the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of 50 000 bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring twenties a more drastic contrast could not be imagined raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening's entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple re takes the western inter titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day off duty entertainment by desert police becomes a policeman's ball the producers went on to make the docu drama chang 1927 and the totally commercial king kong 1933 the migration theme is used again in people of the wind 1976 and in himalaya 1999 recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into and then highly recommended for them
<START> yeah right br br i spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off it was horribly boring and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction then the hero comes into the picture born as an asian but when he grew up he became white obviously white he wasn't even close to passing for asian he looked like justin timberlake it was extremely distracting and the story did nothing to help the cause pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue it's an hour and forty five minutes long and by the end i was trying to eat my own face i watched this because people at the video store where i work are always asking me if this movie is any good now i have an answer it goes something like this ahem no good god no it's horrible don't do this to yourself i would recommend another movie perhaps one that's entertaining
<START> sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war painted natives this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
