<START> now this is one of big's best jack hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all they're worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdoch br br the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works it's very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays br br ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed
<START> huge exhaustive and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin scorcese needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director for anyone even remotely interested in american films or cinema in general a masterpiece and the best of the bfi's century of cinema series br br
<START> i'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film br br for content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybody br br i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off br br apparently a 'huge fight up on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people br br characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next day br br the fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo glitch soundtrack
<START> the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood whose work i admire immensely the leads had absolutely no chemistry not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them the story just didn't ring true add to that stilted conversation tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you've got yourself a real stinker kay lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled cheesy
<START> this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie and definitely the hottest women but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br here is the plot and if you read it with a little inflection you have the acting as well br br beginning bring in characters hot woman singing obvious lip sync music agent or producer comes in thinks that she is awesome asks her to race she turns down too many bad memories flash to war hero back from war has several fights and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone drive off in fast exotic car brother races then dies hero to avenge death cut away to getting weapons from friend you have never seen this friend before or after but seems to really care about him are you sure you want to do this yes i mean are you really sure yes give me weapons are you really sure yes ok i guess i can't talk you out of it be careful man i love you br br now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove finds woman decides to rescue her she drives off and he doesn't finish killing his uncle now there will be a race to finish the movie oh yeah need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter but maybe it adds a little plot race is not even that exciting of course it ends with two cars racing and one that should win throws in a surprise ending br br ok i just saved you 7 00 you can send all of your money to me because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does don't get me wrong the cars are awesome and nadija is beautiful but it is truly an awful movie
<START> a cry in the dark br br a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid if unremarkable film this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep's best actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groups br br little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama well constructed on every level if you ask me this is an under appreciatted classic br br the film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family fred schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy streep and michael sam neill chamberlain care for their children br br while the famous line a dingo took my baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured it is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questions br br the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects lindy of murder br br the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping as an audience member i was fully invested in the chamberlain's plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media but at the same the media public opinion is understandable i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their views br br the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas br br in terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill and they deliver in every way for me this ranks as one of if not 1 meryl streep's best performances for all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters i find this to be one of streep's more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park and neill an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park is a perfect counterpoint to streep's performance from what i've seen this is undoubtedly neill's finest work to date it's a shame he wasn't recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep's b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly br br more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams the dingo took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line br br a
<START> as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men Â whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide br br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the half way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary br br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies Â so those who aren't familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out br br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten maybe i'm the only one but it strained my eyes br br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you Â an interesting build up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country music montage about peace and serenity br br throw in some grisly from behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland asian thriller br br i just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions Âi thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us Â tetanus br br 4 10
<START> gunga din one of the greatest adventure stories ever told a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly water bearer named gunga din a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism their's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other gunga din longs to be a soldier too a bugler in particular but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing however heroes are not made according to their social credentials they're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks you're a better man than i am gunga din one of hollywood's classics and a perfect 10
<START> this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season the others in order of viewing were the uninspired the black tulip 1964 from the same director as this one but not nearly as good the surprisingly effective lady oscar 1979 which had originated as a japanese manga and the splendid cartouche 1962 actually i had watched this one not too long ago on late night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion br br incidentally fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore mentioned cartouche not just cast and crew members producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine cinematographer christian matras actor noel roquevert but plot wise as well Â in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier jean paul belmondo's cartouche had also had a brief military spell who's loved by a fiery girl in this case gypsy gina lollobrigida while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love here it's none other than the king's daughter as in the later film too fanfan an ideally cast gerard philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time is flanked by two fun loving yet cowardly men one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks the ageing roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl for the record lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film rene clair's delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit 1952 br br fanfan proved to be a big box office hit on its home ground and even copped a surprising but well deserved best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris 1951 detective story 1951 othello umberto d and viva zapata in fact its popularity ensured its re release in a computer colored version presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black and white product with a ten foot pole and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant being obviously a foreign language title there's also the dubious choice of an english dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done there's simply no substitute for the original br br fanfan la tulipe a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour contains about as much comedy as the expected action and romance while some may find this overwhelming i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski's equally droll the adventures of gerard 1970 that said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent and the film itself rather adult at times with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout when viewed back to back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax then is quite ingenious the enemy forces who amusingly are made to speak in speeded up gibberish are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the king's amazement who as portrayed by marcel herrand Â best known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne''s children of paradise 1945 Â is himself something of a lecher br br p s an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian jaque's promising champagne for savages 1964 for months now but despite programming it three times already with a tentative fourth one slated for next week they have yet to show it even so i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile equally culled from late night italian tv screenings the three hour epic la chartreuse de parme 1948 also starring gerard philippe the second twin 1967 and the legend of frenchie king 1971 with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale
<START> at times this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubrick's is more artistic more thought provoking and probably scarier it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book Â which i've only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death Â because the two don't have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously it's almost as if kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening and it that way it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made as well as one of the greatest horror films br br what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time it's the destruction of jack torrence some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film given his past roles and his appearance i disagree we know he's going to go crazy Â since most of us have read the book Â and jack's appearance only furthers this notion but it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared he's calm quiet patient he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family and with a wife and son as irritating as his it's a small wonder that he manages to do so but once he gets to the overlook he changes he becomes irritable angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and he utterly loses it telling her to leave him the f alone this is the first f bomb dropped in the film and it's a shock to the system from then on all bets are off br br another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film we're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost there's a mirror present showing that he may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the film's climax until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question Â how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel Â but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness it's easy to claim that jack merely loses it being trapped in a hotel with his family and wendy later does as well Â seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that Â but what of danny it appears that his body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and he warns of the dangers in 237 but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel and that final shot has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history Â probably on purpose to give jack's character more of a reason to snap Â and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a powerhouse part method part improvisation he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better or for worse he's the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid or nagging wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be able to do whatever we want who cares if it's haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubrick's long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long hallways and every other motif only heightens this and don't even get me started on that score i don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itself br br i know king doesn't like this film but king's input on cinema is nothing to brag about as great of a novel writer he may be his screenplays are terrible and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doesn't need to be and it really shouldn't part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on there's no reassuring source material kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and it's got everything else on top of that
<START> i felt this movie started out well the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end and i was begging for it to just be over with any movie with such a long drawn out and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater this movie pulled me in then just spit me out
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasn't needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents br br freddy is back but he's got something we don't know about a daughter maggie she's not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn't it but freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3 d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best br br 2 10
<START> this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there's nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they don't redeem the flat monotony br br the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation br br i went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it's a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part 2 i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing br br at the opening in la wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure
<START> where do they get the money to make films like this i mean there's nothing redeeming about this film none of the actors are known the writing is terrible the photography is blurry the story wanders between being a bad version of repo man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable for someone who watches all kinds of film good and bad i must admit that this film is about the worst i've seen since attack of the eye people back in the 50's i don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or heaven forbid art but this film would seem to appeal to no one the story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who's a bad version of the celtic soul eater although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones the bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from take it from there as that alas is the best part my advice is that unless you are into bad mythology amateurish writing unconvincing acting and tedious settings you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos
<START> this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome kerry was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played rory was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again
<START> very bad film very very very bad film it's a rarity but it defenitly is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub plots go nowhere if it's at the local video store you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies but it's not worth hunting down
<START> i was surprised when i saw this film i'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel how disappointed i was br br how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes the scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times but also ruin the feel of the period as for the cast gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine but then any 'hot' american star would be questionable in the role toni collette is miscast and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughable br br i really could not say a good thing about this film i seem to be among the very few who don't rate it but if you want my advice see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale believe me that is far preferable to this superficial trash
<START> an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first br br once again the casting is just wonderful i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness br br the second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband just like the first episode karma br br the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real
<START> an very good storyline good thrill to it but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a 1 in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that chris shadley could come up with a better end but maybe next time all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a 10 but it didn't the end destroyed the whole story i think most people aren't lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end even if it is intricate but the only lame here is the end sorry
<START> this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo
