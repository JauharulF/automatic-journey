<START> i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon a part of the world that always has intrigued me i believe a condensed form of the book was published in reader's digest soon after the actual event occurred br br because i am a baby boomer the character and the actress are my contemporaries and for this reason i related to the film i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character's following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help as well as other survival techniques most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude in conclusion i hope viewers learn something from it in addition seeing it for entertainment br br i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels
<START> i can't tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non existant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles fort a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode br br don't waste your time it would be better spent reading br br well anything to be honest
<START> one of the requirements of science fiction at least before it starts to become satire is that it be somewhat plausible i would think that an anti matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but i'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis br br it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand they're getting close to earth so much so that it's become unseasonably hot as if the entire earth were death valley the answer is an anti matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it's not in direct alignment with the earth br br who to deliver it but captain tim matheson and his crew that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son corin nemec taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston matheson's father and nemec's grandfather br br there's a villain here too peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors the idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking he's doing his best to sabotage matheson's mission br br solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts accordingly br br the rest of the cast are stalwart true blue and dull except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him br br the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films allen smithee the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving
<START> joshua seftel's first film a satire of memorable proportions is about just as the title suggests the corporations effect on war br br the film is about a mercenary john cusack traveling to turaqistan not a real country fyi to help the american government 'get their message across' to turaqistan's leaders he meets a reporter marisa tomei and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man a hot reporter somewhere in the mix a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan's most important people a son of the president a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star well somewhat the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar no more than fifteen seconds later the film hooks you with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics the film's running time blows by you the film has a lot more action than i expected with the occasional scene of war well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder though the story isn't much deep the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike br br in the final act of the film the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled i thought it was executed very well but other may disagree and i could understand why twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hit miss situation regardless the three writers on the film mark leyner jeremy pikser john cusack did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas br br joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity not reducing the material to the most redundant of films which i was afraid would happen seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities contrasting them perfectly as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely no missteps here hopefully he takes on more directorial jobs for he is one director to look out for
<START> this film has nothing whatever to do with the sphinx and the title is just a come on the story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the valley of the kings of king seti i second pharaoh of the 19th dynasty new kingdom period it is not a bad yarn and a great deal of the film is shot on location even the scenes in the winter palace hotel lobby in luxor were really shot there and not in a studio the second unit stuff is endless and they must have been let loose on egypt for weeks frank langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated egyptian he should take it up as a sideline the film is essentially ruined by one of the world's most irritating actresses lesley anne down who plays the lead she spends the whole film wondering how she looks are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle do all the fellas lust after her etc having started life as a model at the age of ten what hope could there be for her she epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dim witted inanity and to think that this film was directed by franklin shaffner who won an oscar for 'patton' he allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film hysterical one moment flirting the next in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another either screaming or making bedroom eyes it matters not she is supposed to be a young egyptologist but she has never been to egypt before she takes a taxi to giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids gushes in ecstasy 'but they're so big ' barf ok so that was the script but she takes to the banality too readily giving the impression that it is her natural element which i don't doubt for a minute elements of the story are sound there is indeed a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there true well done the novel by robin cook which i have not seen may be ok for all i know it was fun to see the name of cyril swern as sound recordist on the film as i knew him pretty well long ago stanley kubrick's step daughter katharina is described as 'draughtswoman' i wonder what that means maybe she did some set work anyway the antiquities in the film are pretty good actually and we get to see lots of the cairo museum and numerous scenic locations they actually go inside king tutankhamun's tomb i don't imagine that would be allowed today for a movie a lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques that would not go down well today but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda the music for the film is absolutely appalling worse than lesley anne down in fact but there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic one being the cacophony of traffic noise of cairo which is accurately rendered in the background and would make anyone who knows cairo chuckle nervously also the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time another touch of authenticity why didn't they get this right it could have been good
<START> i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler
<START> guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals musicals were made to entertain not to to preach nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando the guy can't sing it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldn't understand him if it weren't for marlon i would have given this 10 stars guys and dolls provides old fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days watch it to have a good time
<START> ossessione adapted loosely or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m cain's the postman always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i can't be certain by first time director luchino visconti is no less outstanding with usage of mis en scene music both diegetic and non diegetic and the acting i didn't know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material after seeing la terra trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit but this is a totally character and emotional based drama bordering on melodrama however without the conventions that bog down lesser ones and with the style in the finest path of the budding film noir movement visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo realist film neo realism by the way could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather along with de sica's the children are watching us which that would take shape after the war although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo realist efforts it's dealt with in a bare bones storytelling fashion and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo realism the lower class death desperation br br aside from the story which is simply as it is described on this site the artistry with which visconti captures the images and then layers them with objects a shawl over gino costa's profile when in guilt shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film usually over gian and giovanna and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes domenico scala and aldo tonti who would lens some of rossellini and fellini's films help in envisioning the look of ossessione which is usually moving in on a character then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly sad and dark and romantic i think i've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along even as i was in fear of the futures of the two leads the two leads massimo girotti and clara calamai portray all the compelling truthful and near operatic emotions and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes br br it's a brilliant crushing adaptation and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for visconti in his career
<START> what's up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works by candlelight br br don't waste your time in fact don't waste your time with anything altman makes it's all a pretentious waste of film
<START> before the regular comments my main curiosity about this is not a love song is that while there's a running time listed on imdb of 94 minutes the dvd from wellspring media in the united states runs 88 minutes any input on this is appreciated br br two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure what they wind up in is just that with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside rather than just a big chase the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike spike behaving inappropriately and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character spike but without a bit of frustration added to the story the film would have been too easy you'll notice the way the more stable character heaton refers to spike as big man in contrast to spike's kid out of control attitude and behavior frankly i too was aggravated by spike's ridiculous actions especially the spray can sniffing but in a desperate situation it's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape but heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well br br kenny glenaan as heaton is a marvel and after a while i quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick spike up from prison and continue a friendship due to glenaan's great performance after all there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for heaton to just ditch spike and try to save himself i suppose heaton felt like a protective older brother to spike and the loyalty between the two is hard to break until things get too desperate br br while some of the cinematography is indeed artsy it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness the beautiful landscapes rain and vast gray skies offer a somber tone that increases the feel of the tragic circumstances the score is unusual as well and the use of public image ltd 's song this is not a love song and as the title of the film is quite smart br br overall it's understandable if you don't care for this is not a love song as it's focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down played by a cool quiet david bradley it's not big budget action entertainment for the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic it's time worthwhile spent and it does offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit br br i'm really enjoying the films coming out of scotland recently with the likes of this one dog soldiers and the devil's tattoo i'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this dvd as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand br br frustrating dark and often tense this is not a love song is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling br br
<START> susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt i'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers i'm not one of them br br i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn br br young mr rijn contributes the worst performance in the film in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time no wonder he's not gone anywhere br br i will say that seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot but her work with her live performers didn't measure up i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with br br look fast and you'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler br br if you like punk rock you might sit through this for the soundtrack i'll stick to bing crosby
<START> the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera deeply character driven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable self effacing crumpled self and the bride kidnap victim is a whimpering one dimensional damsel in distress she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor come on i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you know what in 2 seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of reality the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours
<START> the premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd br br believe me i'm a fan of kevin kline but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds br br for her part meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being br br this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well paid for it so i can't really blame them
<START> a friend clearly with no taste or class suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins if this is representative of his oeuvre i never want to see anything else by him it is amateurish self indulgent criminally shoddy and self indulgent rubbish the whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers there is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose the lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention atkins was one of those featured he spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this i see nothing of any import whatsoever there is no style either and the horrible video effects like solarization only enhance the amateurishness not even so bad it's fun avoid
<START> best show since seinfeld she's really really funny her total self centeredness the hulking gay stoner neighbors the departures into song or cartoons make this the freshest show on tv one of the few shows i make point of watching the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore oh wait now that you're close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol the cough syrup overdose sleeping with god it's all so funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun the shows weak points are her sister and the cop only because they're too darn normal i really can't wait until the next show something i haven't felt for any show in a long time
<START> i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard in these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far fetched but it was very true and i'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing i'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i don't like it's a wonderful life either
<START> mardi gras made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions americans seemed sad hurt and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own br br m pitts
<START> i enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate from reading other comments here i suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full size screen in the cinema in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience i was lucky enough to have that experience borne up on ripples of laughter from all around and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy br br for it is as a comedy that it shines if it shines anywhere at all the music is nothing special in fact i hadn't realised it was a musical and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half spoken lyric but i do have to admit that the half threat half promise of 'oh what i'll do ' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time as it's still going round and round in my head br br the plot such as it is largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous francesca a sixteenth century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur coat her idea on the sanctity of marriage don't quite jibe with those of her distant descendant the countess angelina and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the production code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much delayed marriage bed with the right man br br the romance is scarcely earth shattering and in fact the first few scenes played pretty well straight verge on the tedious but where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows the impudence of douglas fairbanks jr's courtship of betty grable's married angelina is equalled only by betty grable as francesca's pursuit of him in turn culminating in complete role reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she literally sweeps him off his feet this is probably the comic climax of the plot although the consequences of the colonel's understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two 'acts' of the operetta structure and the spectacle of fairbanks' blissful bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own br br grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters wisely gets almost all the limited singing opportunities and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned but in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set up and humour is worthy of the silent screen br br this film is too uneven in style to be a classic varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium but at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up out of tune with its times it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences but on this showing really didn't deserve to be disowned by both grable and preminger the uncredited director this is no masterpiece but a thoroughly entertaining minor work and i for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home
<START> it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen but hostel is definitely much more worse this movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary i laughed most of the time when watched it low quality effects when you gonna watch it you'll understand what i'm talking about and how low quality is that bad actors i hear of them for the first time and it seems like it's shot by an amateur camcorder so it looks more like a tv show than a movie but at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end like comedies watch it wanna horror go watch ju on the grudge or some other good horror movie br br if i'm talking about the legend of diablo i don't even know if i can classify it to a horror genre just some low budget crap br br i rate it 3 out of 10
<START> carl panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him the book panzram a journal of murder by thomas e gaddis and james o long which came out the better part of a century after panzram's death gives the historical context to a first generation american's account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy getting caught thrown in the boy's home getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized as panzram grew huge and strong he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to south america europe and africa and it didn't matter what people he raped robbed or murdered because we are all equally worthless br br this film casts skinny james woods as the rough neck mean ass son of a bitch carl panzram who in the film is a drunk overly dramatic and emotional and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys the film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner like robbing former president taft or being released from the oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return in short i don't think carl would be too happy
