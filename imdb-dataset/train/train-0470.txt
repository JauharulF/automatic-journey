<START> de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbÃ© who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van huÃªt but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked 'spoorloos' the vanishing's original screen adaptation
<START> about three minutes into this thing i started fast forwarding pausing only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women in ten minutes i was done and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa come on writers the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control that's the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years burt reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movies br br this movie is just a waste of time run away run away
<START> since most review's of this film are of screening's seen decade's ago i'd like to add a more recent one the film open's with stock footage of b 17's bombing germany the film cut's to oskar werner's hauptmann captain wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler's fuehrer bunker once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cut's to one of many conference scene's with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer's to ultimate victory while werner's character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen's are caught up in a fantasy world some non bunker event's are depicted most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit's and his family's difficulty in surviving this film suffer's from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 year's after ww2 should not have included the actor portraying goebbels willy krause wear's the same uniform as hitler including arm eagle goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband the ss soldier's wear german army camouflage the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy's of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker it was done outside in the courtyard and lastly hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922 most account's agree it was a walther ppk some bit's of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a cabaret skit with a intoxicated wounded soldier his arm in a splint maniacally goose stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease belly dance all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watch the most incredible bit is when werner's captain wust gain's an audience alone with skoda's hitler hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench drugged and delirious when werner's character begin's to question him hitler start's screaming which bring's in a ss guard who mortally wound's werner's character in the back with a gunshot this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account werner's character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare's his own ending hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off screen the final second's of the movie show hitler's funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner hauptmann wust this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film's such as the 1973 remake hitler the last 10 day's or the german film downfall der untergang if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story these last two film's are based on first person eyewitness account's with hitler the last 10 day's being compiled from gerhard boldt's autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and downfall being done from hitler's secretary's recollection's the screen play for der letzte akte is taken from american nuremberg war crime's trial judge michael musmanno's book ten day's to die which is more a compilation of event's many obviously fanciful than eyewitness history it is surprising that hugh trevor roper's account the last day's of hitler was never made into a film
<START> i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination there's also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable and horrifying to a kid but i can't imagine a grown up buying into this shlock although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them
<START> after the glories of the snare it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better and this doesn't breach that expectation but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment the screenplay comes from yasuzo masumura and has some parallels with the snare as well as the expected hi jinks of a hanzo film but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by amping up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a quieter reflective edge the film opens with hanzos assistants scared by a ghost and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a stash of stolen coins and from this set up unfolds a story of theft corruption and usury with expected violent and sleazy results shintaro katsu is terrific as expected as hanzo coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling the expected comedy comes off fine as well his moments with snake magobei are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are kookily entertaining as ever though neatly laden throughout with nice moments a fair amount of action and a little sleaze the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach there are shades of both prior films the plotting pace and smarts recall the snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence equally though director yoshio inoue presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per kenji misumi's less well handled work in sword of justice with consequences sometimes very nice as with a man playing a tune on the koto with close ups of his fingers plucking at the strings as unbeknownest to him hanzo ploughs his wife and sometimes a bit weak as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic whirl of limbs in motion that just looks confusing the nudity and bloodshed is generally downplayed which is a pity though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and unrestrained nudity and violence are most appropriate but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff the predictable moments are wrought with aplomb and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement even some effective surprises to go around its a film for the fans really playing off the work laid down in the previous instalments and working sweetly if not spectacularly with it altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiasts of such things
<START> all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you plus jessica is just all kinds of hot the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen
<START> i'm a huge steven seagal fan hell i probably weigh as much as he does although i don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy mullet ponytail having stated my own bias and affection for america's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero it is with a heavy heart that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever i'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this br br in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post production it's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline that results in woeful voiceovers in which steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad gets even worse and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead yes it's that bad br br after this i don't know what to expect from steve my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs if you are tempted to watch this movie rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this
<START> this film has an interesting plot but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor i was very disappointed the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was i stuck it out to the end but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable
<START> this reminded me of spinal tap on a more serious level it's the story of a band doing a reunion tour but things are not harmonious between them i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray you felt sorry for him yet he had a certain creepiness about him it's a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly old and pathetic bittersweet highly recommended
<START> when i saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that i had it is easy to watch because it is animated which makes it unthreatening it has no moral bias or preachy aspects so nobody should have any objections to it it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring matter of fact way i hope to show it to my daughter
<START> i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film br br jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss lakhan singh english the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh who is also known as bhaiyyaji but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji lakhan singh is a don in the meantime bhaiyyaji hires a man bachchan pandey to track down jimmy and pooja br br starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and akshaye kumar the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra br br tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember now br br there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain lastly never mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie br br conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression
<START> la chute de la maison usher or the fall of the house of usher as it's know amongst english audiences starts with allan charles lamy heading for the castle of his good friend sir roderick usher jean debucourt who sent him a letter saying that his wife madeleine is ill once there allan finds madeleine very sick her husband roderick determined almost obsessed to paint her portrait as roderick paints madeleine becomes weaker weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes br br this french production was co written produced directed by jean epstein was the second of two filmed the fall of the house of usher adaptations during 1928 honestly i don't know the original novel was published in 1839 i mean you wait 89 years for a filmed adaptation two come along at the same time anyway i feel that i have a bit of a problem here as i have read plenty of positive comments about la chute de la maison usher maybe i'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but i have to say that it simply didn't do anything for me i didn't like it obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film therefore it relies on imagery but even so i thought the story was weak i thought as a whole the film was boring dull even though it only lasts for about an hour it really didn't do anything for me at all la chute de la maison usher was made almost 80 years ago that is literally a lifetime the world cinema tastes have moved on a lot since then i found no enjoyment in this film i feel this film has dated badly probably wasn't that good to start with anyway i never felt for any of the character's i never cared about anything that was happening i found it all rather tedious to sit through i'm sorry if i've offended any silent film fans out there but that's the way i felt br br director epstein does an ok job a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in la chute de la maison usher i will freely admit it definitely has it's moments but i thought they were few far between shots of people's mouths moving not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me i didn't like the music the version i saw kept the original french language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick french accent which was also off putting based on the story by edgar allen poe i doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements stick with the fantastic roger corman house of usher starring vincent price br br technically the film was ok considering when it was made you simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try suggest emotions or reflect what's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft br br la chute de la maison usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era who live in caves or who are stuck in the past for me i like my films to have a story not to bore me to have sound i'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that's how i feel the world has moved on since 1928 for the better
<START> in a poor village in mexico the colonel fernando lujÃ¡n lives with his asthmatic wife lola marisa paredes in an old house lola still grieves the death of their son augustin some time ago the colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty seven years however for political reasons the present government wants to forget this old fight without having any possession or money but a valuable gamecock they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries in brazil most of the retired persons has to survive with about us 80 00 per month the debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son otherwise he would be buried as an indigent outstanding performance of the cast in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries my vote is eight br br title brazil nÃ£o se escreve ao coronel' do not write to the colonel br br
<START> victor mclaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history br br i think we can all feel for gypo because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong this was one of the first art house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio rko radio pictures br br joseph h august's cinematography is at its very best here however august's stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved br br this is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible
<START> i had never heard of this film until i came across it by accident when browsing imdb i saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk of course this meant i had to see it i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie i watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed hollywood fluff comedies this is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter sex and dating without the usual hollywood fakery i distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life if you've never dated or partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters if you have you'll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion the ending was also good as it did not portray women as unreal helpless virginal romantics in contrast to many hollywood movies
<START> most would agree that the character of wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history i'm no marvel expert but i did grow up with the adventures of the x men and definitely approved of hugh jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy logan i enjoyed the first x men found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment all through the three movies i probably enjoyed jackman more than anything else i figured the idea of making an origins movie about wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three x men movies if we concentrate on one character i figured there could be a movie that achieves what i found the second movie failed at being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure br br the reason that the wolverine movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after the dark knight it's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary even though that certainly isn't good no it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try to begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment there is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic with no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an uwe boll movie imitating an action adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of bolls t but when everybody's talking clichÃ©s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough br br but there is an even bigger problem even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities i think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title i mean origins really what to the people behind this movie think about that title what do they mean you want to know the origins of wolverine he grew up with his brother they ran away from home during dramatic circumstances then they went off to war all of them the civil war world war i and ii and vietnam too why did they do this still unknown eventually the brother sabertooth played by liev shrieber became evil how you ask i don't know it was somewhere between omaha beach and hanoi yeah but why you still ask i just said i don't know the movie doesn't explain he's evil alright yeah but you know 'origins' yeah well that's an origin i mean duh anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers something with the government ho hum wolvie gets enough and leave his brother for six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one who ends up a little defenseless around the time sabretooth suddenly appears again yeaaah but whyyyy oh shut up and wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh covered metal war animal he goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue x men the first movie br br there that's the origin you can also find it on the back of the dvd cover the actual movie won't tell you anything else with no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general lines from my couch audience fat suit token black guy oh i give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie that is supposed to be gambit mmhm yeah well uh huh right not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a t shirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right fans will check this out or have already there's no stopping that but if you liked the x men movies for no other reason than that they were well made and entertaining see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none
<START> what a fun movie st ives is it reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's classic story rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated in fact it isn't over anything robert lewis stevenson's story here adapted for the screen reads like jane austen for men we do get a tale that has a romance at its heart but there is plenty of fun too battle scenes sort of prison escapes mistaken identities swordplay and the funniest line i've heard in years only in scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball there is much hilarity hardship and not a little heartbreak as st ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew br br the cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen jean marc barr absolutely perfect in the title role anna friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful flora and miranda richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and worldly been there and seen it all aunt susan richard grant provides comic relief of the highest order br br this is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen but its charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life
<START> playing kaddiddlehopper col san fernando etc the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream i love watching him interact w amanda blake or don knotts or whomever he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a disciplined 19 take kind of production relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there br br he reminds me of guys like milton berle benny hill maybe jerry lewis some too great timing ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades sheer enjoyment about what he was doing his sad little clown he played was good too but in a touching manner br br personally i think he's great having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from '61 or so it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so br br check this out if you are a fan or curious he was a riot
<START> a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfield's slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think why am i watching this ' that question will be coursing through your minds in 5 Â 10 minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching br br just my opinion br br
<START> most 70s and 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really br br but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a 'style' it's really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works br br second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today's measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future br br least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfolds' the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn't know who he's seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre br br the 'five venoms' idea is the template for tarantino's 'deadly viper assassins' from the kill bill volumes
