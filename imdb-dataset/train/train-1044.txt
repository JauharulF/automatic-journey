<START> the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out something no uncommon for me in recent years i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but i believe the at one time pre amelia talented director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool
<START> a female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood she has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker after a few kills the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl br br what can i say about this movie that its pacing is over slow that it has some strange sound effects never a bite sounded so strange and ambiance new jazz here i come and that lights don't seem to be included on the set it looks like an auteur horror movie with all the self sufficiency inside br br the plot is completely stupid and as you can guess it's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't have to do it of course crosses light garlic and sticks don't work br br it's not even a funny lousy movie perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers it can't have its funny sides to be honest it's funny during 10 15 minutes near the end of the movie don't be fooled by the troma sticker it's one the bad movie they present
<START> billed as the story of steve biko played excellently by denzel washington as you'd expect this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin kline br br this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role br br attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across br br the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past
<START> foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it porky's fast times at ridgement high the movie holds up well against time br br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio remember him lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching br br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy away br br but rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike br br the film's opening Â a long and loving pan sets the tone for what follows we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola while donna summer's on the radio is scored beneath br br from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life annie runaway rocker cherie currie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill deirdre kandice stroh is the boy crazy drama queen madge marlilyn stroh is the shy girl in over her head and foster is the one with the plan it's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line sally kellerman br br it's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at br br despite its age foxes remains a pleasure to watch dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill haven't hurt the movie br br the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the l a basin at dawn dusk and at night giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian br br perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmo's fire 1985 or empire records 1995 foxes shows why they should have but perhaps like bowling for soup's song 1985 they just hit a wall
<START> one of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market by the mid 80s the routine plot has echoes of the magnificent seven believe it or not the action scenes are lamely handled and the special effects are non existent you could do worse but the film is still just a waste of time 1 2
<START> this movie is about a cop ching wan lau trying to catch a super clever thief ekin cheng who blackmails an insurance company headed by a kelly lin basically whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand this movie covered by handsome lead actors beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of hong kong scenes really has no substance at all it's all flash and the flash quickly becomes dull too i lost all interests a third of the way into the movie and there is no redeeming quality after that except for the cinematography which looks good only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free also consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it's all the same to the end boring 6 10
<START> knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say the plot i really shouldn't call it that there wasn't any plot wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes like warning i'm summarizing the plot br br in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs the bad guys but after the climax nea found out that there were many many more left of them and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill but after a month's training nea could kill them with a single blow br br the movie was just pure kicking i wasn't surprised at all when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer br br there was one positive thing in the whole movie it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends i recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter
<START> i thought the children in the show did a very good job i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character well done the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes i enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her the ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along there wasn't a lot of slow scenes the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching
<START> the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show quack pack shouldn't even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales it's about a teen aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg there's no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales
<START> a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth bragana a fat bellied gas station tenant who has been getting on in years picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of br br the arrival of gino a young migrant worker finally provides her the longed for opportunity and you don't have to ask her twice at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance br br the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside giovanna aims at another goal to get bragana killed to inherit and in addition to that to collect the insurance premium in her hands gino degenerates into a self sacrificing tool being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold blooded killer br br but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level the very taking over of bragana's place which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man causes a deep loathing of himself and later after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna's cunningly devised plan he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute br br if visconti's film ended at this point it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino's love her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate it also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start br br
<START> immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago a friend and i decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale there was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was to this day we still rate movies even very bad ones by how much better than the lonely lady they are br br a long time ago i saw an interview with eleanor perry who wrote the screenplays for among other things last summer and diary of a mad housewife and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold robbins' book the lonely lady she said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in hollywood she then said i think they got someone else to write it the interview was filmed before the movie was released she died in 1981 and i bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result
<START> the history of the fbi as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks interwoven with his personal life story stewart and miles as his wife are pretty good as is hamilton as an earnest agent the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved it's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters some of the episodes are too long some too short and some just look out of place stewart's daughter's school sequence overall it goes on way too long nevertheless it's worth a look for its handsome production values
<START> the film school intellects can drool all they want about the important imagined meaning of this film but it's just that intellectual drool this film is creatively bankrupt and some mistake it's endless self indulgent wanking as substance yeah br br obviously godard wasn't a stones fan too bad because this could have been great he's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap br br then there's the endless shots of what looks like 60's librarians spray painting words on people's cars and then there's the seemingly neverending interview where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions there's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book which goes on for oh only about 20 minutes and black panthers or something in a junkyard br br it almost sounds intriguing well it's not br br but for unwashed film school hipsters who don't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag's this film's a real winner br br more accurately maybe godard just blows
<START> first of all excuse my bad english of course only a movie starring jessica simpson can include serious goofs like this i'm a norwegian and i felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this american norwegian movie even wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country br br so i'm posting my corrections out of my frustration the country is named norway not norwegia da is russian not norwegian norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far it's true we have a native traditional folk outfit that we only use like twice a year but the outfit in this movie is more like a german outfit i could not understand the so called norwegian in this movie jessica was not making any sense neighter did the norwegian priests br br the only thing i recognise is the norwegian flag and the viking hats but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway vikings o gosh br br well i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment but at least i cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration br br i'm proud of my country and i'd love if people in the us were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country br br that was all lenge leve norge p
<START> this is possibly the worst of all the columbo movies andrew stevens' acting is poor as the villain and the plot is weak in fact none of the cast seem able to act other than peter falk who puts in a creditable performance as the lieutenant
<START> telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trend br br george c scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set ups yet relying on the depth and clarity of on site shooting and strong backdrops a movie that certainly stands alone
<START> deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg zombie like machines which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected br br technically superb horror comedy is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying good taste prevents me from describing what happens here but lets just say its pretty gruesome if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on as revealed in the end i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to there is an internal logic rare in these films br br 7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else
<START> seriously can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget daniel day lewis ray mcanally brenda fricker hugh o'conor and fiona shaw there's no doubting that fricker and day lewis deserved their awards but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen o'conor as young christie and mcanally awarded the clichÃ© is true here they don't perform the roles they inhabit them day lewis' performance is a tour de force such a transformation that it is awe inducing but it was truly a mark of the academy's intelligence that alongside this performance they also honoured brenda fricker's beautifully restrained still and heart wrenching work as christie's mother by the way if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in swann that's another film well worth checking out for her contribution and the sublime miranda richardson
<START> show me your boobies is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i'm coming from i don't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then that's what we get stupid little kids acting like stupid adults i know it's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and 1st grade who can't wait to see this i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it my daughters won't be watching it i'd love to block nick but don't have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i'll have to
<START> i try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years i have not seen every episode br br the show is about danny tanner who is guy who does news for sports his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair joey an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls donna joe they call her d j stephinie who is the second oldest and michelle the youngest br br they all live under one roof with no one to help them out br br later in the show jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins nicki and alex this starts to happen in the new seasons this show is awesome if you like the suite life of zack and cody that's so raven boy meets world and designing woman you will love this it starts to get better in the ending seasons watch it you will love it
