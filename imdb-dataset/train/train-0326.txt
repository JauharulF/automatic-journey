<START> when the magic of lassie opened at radio city music hall i was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart warming as some of the first lassie films were not br br the story was abysmal the songs by the sherman brothers were way below their usual level the characters were uninspired and james stewart and mickey rooney had both seen much better days br br then too i was interested in seeing what alice faye's contribution would be like since she'd been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so fetching in her earlier roles at fox alice too was letdown by the foolish script and the unflattering photography another disappointment br br nothing original here nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy and clearly no magic present for anyone you can skip this one without missing a thing
<START> i like end of days movies i like b movies i was hoping i would like this movie br br i could ignore the poor effects the often atrocious music the cringe inducing lines i could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys none of these things kill the movie what kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers at the cost of actually having a coherent story or any kind of suspense br br if you're looking for an entertaining b movie look elsewhere this movie is just boring
<START> first of all jon bon jovi doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable if you keep that in mind and you're a total vampire movie fan you can have some fun with a few of the scenes don't expect any tarantino style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow
<START> horrible people ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things then look out of your window at real life but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things you'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh the characters talk at length but never actually manage to communicate with each other why not presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and he wants to film real life but we're not and he failed
<START> oliver twist was to have controversy as well as success following it after dickens published it in 1837 his picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another innovation br br one day he was walking in london and passed a young woman he had been friendly with he said hello but she was rather stiff with him he could not understand this a few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to upset her well if you must know i did not like your last novel she said really everyone else thinks highly of it he was puzzled what's wrong with it oh charles she said i'm jewish how could you make up such a character like fagin he had not expected this well you know that trial last year of ikey solomon the thief trainer he's a model for fagin and he was jewish br br dickens found that did not settle things yes she replied he got what he deserved but charles they did not call him solomon the jew like you call fagin the jew moreover solomon did not plan a murder fagin does dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away he left thinking about what she said br br oliver twist was published in several editions dickens tried to improve on fagin a bit then he got an idea he reworked the chapter called fagin's last night alive showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging he also added some additional details br br he let his female friend know about his resolve to change fagin a day or so later he met her at a friend's house she looked at him as though he was crazy didn't you like the changes he asked charles what changes he's still a vile villain called the jew she replied yes i did keep those in but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison the young woman had noticed this but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears ah then i was right about that and did you see the little details i added he asked what details she replied when you first see fagin now he is cooking himself dinner you read that dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition instead the lady looked confused i read he was at the fireplace but i must have skimmed the passage dickens smiled as though he was brilliant he is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner a what she exclaimed he's eating pork my dear see he's not a good jew his friend looked at him shook her head and to his dismay left their friend's house she didn't speak to him for years br br dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel in our mutual friend 1865 he has a minor character mr riah who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants the landlord figures that mr riah will be blamed because he is jewish br br but mr riah is a good man he is a very good man he is a very very very very good man so good as to be unbelievable if fagin saw mr riah in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick br br the anti semitic image of fagin lingers to this day it is a measure of dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it however in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors how after the holocaust can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry david lean showed how by having alec guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity sir carol reed in his musical version of the novel did it better yet due to a rewrite in the original musical's script br br oliver had been made into a west end musical hit in the middle 1960s and then taken to broadway where it was again a hit with a wonderful score by lionel bart including food glorious food i am reviewing the situation consider yourself boy for sale who will buy as long as he needs me it deserved it's success reed did well in his casting the roles including his nephew oliver reed as sykes ron moody as fagin mark lester as oliver jack wild as the dodger shani wallis as nancy and harry secombe as mr bumble there had been no big musical successes in hollywood for a decade the last musical to win the best picture oscar had been gigi in 1958 oliver won it in 1968 br br and fagin how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature well in the musical fagin is not captured tried and executed for the murder that is committed after all even lean showed fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions but here fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life although he loses his treasures those stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty he decides he can reform he is allowed to do so accompanied by his faithful acolyte the artful dodger i don't think dickens would have appreciated the change his female friend might have but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting
<START> my dog recently passed away and this was a movie i loved as a kid so i had to see it to try to cheer up br br beware of dog i mean spoilers this movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary it was set in new orleans in 1939 first and foremost the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with br br in the beginning charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner carface he is money driven greedy and just escaped death row as he states in the start of the feature the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others anne marie and his sidekick itchy carface will not even listen to the fat ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him br br carface attempts to murder the hero because he wants 100 of the profits in their business and won't settle for only 50 a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die also being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not this is a cartoon and that's why it is logical here br br carface's method of revenge is through murder while charlie believes success is the best revenge financial success that is after surviving death he starts a business by taking carface's source of financing a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals they win a whole bunch of races and charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor hint hint charlie and itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor he uses the money toward his casino bar theatre and not the other poor the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens carefully she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses she added the ethics that his business needed while charlie did management and itchy provided construction br br carface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlie's business which is unprotected by the government charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl in the end he had to choose between her life and his own he first grabs the watch out of self preservation and sets it down when the girl started to sink both the girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one and he chose the girl br br the great part about this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn right from wrong over time and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet is that it never shows anyone dying the watch symbolizes his life and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped all the deaths were suggestive even for the villain i didn't cry during this movie until now and i have gotten so much more out of it that i had to write it down and share it with you
<START> this is one of three 80's movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva a movie horribly overlook due to salva's legal sexual problems another would be cameron's closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated not great but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean 10 years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether
<START> sorry for my faulty language i am no native speaker br br yes this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around but i won't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here because those perfect the one and only best ever reviews make some people turn away including me br br so if you are looking for another 'hamlet' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones then don't miss this one if you happen to find it anywhere unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it it seems there is no dvd out there and the german language version which is quite well done is not available in any format br br just in case you decide to get a copy spare out that cut down two hours or so version of this movie it is no use and no fun and gives a wrong impression of a movie that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture and its also crippled down to 4 3 aspect ratio br br greetings from germany f l
<START> a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love describes this odd david lynch film this was especially odd because it wasn't the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years those were dark and shocking films blue velvet wild at heart mulholland drive and this is the opposite i know it disappointed a lot of his fans others were delighted by it count me as one of the latter and i own all three of those dark films too br br this was another supposed true life story here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western iowa all the way to wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies well i guess that premise an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles still makes this an odd film of sorts so lynch stays in character with that br br richard farnsworth plays the title role he is the type of guy face wise voice wise low key personality wise that just about everyone likes the wrinkles on his face tell many a story it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released br br the first 25 minutes of this film isn't much and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally challenged child sissy spacek and her tragic past but once alvin straight farnsworth begins his trip the story picks up i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up but i am more generous with it i think it's a hidden gem to them it was a sleeping pill br br i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story it is slow and if that's okay with you you might like this charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble henry cada as daniel riordan is a standout in that regard harry dean stanton gets third billing but that's a joke he's only in the final few minutes of the movie br br the iowa scenery is pleasant i lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil it's a nice state with nice people like this movie
<START> after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show's credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and dÃ©cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that's like shooting the first episode of gilligan's island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 Â 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
<START> i don't think i've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing's there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half formed story lines the characters weren't well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and i'm just here to warn you all of that
<START> 'sherrybaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs related conviction and fights to stay clean to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal an actress at the top of her career who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders this is not enough however as the story line is too simplistic and expected and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script writer wanted or about the innocent kid who is in the middle even maggie gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid
<START> this is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the united states we are still working on it too however despite the fact this is true it's still a movie and this is a movie site i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors but wow the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis but even he couldn't make up for all the actors including the one playing him as a young man absolutely atrocious acting granted the script was terribly clichÃ© but even then you have got to get some decent actors i wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category read some books about the true story of the u s s mason because they give these men the respect they deserve
<START> perfect cast for a few person drama simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside what he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by german avant garde composer werner henze simon is haunted by his death comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side his girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to decides to follow him after his finally occurring death very touchy and moving deeply psychological but a bit slow and somewhere even boring
<START> i felt this film throughout i waas impressed with russell crowe's talent in developing his relationship with lillie such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive br br gosh didn't russell's talent even in 1993 shine and i have yet to see gladiator
<START> well i said it all in the summary i simpley adore the movie and the cast i would give each actor an oscar great great movie i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do about 2 or 3 times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy irons also just brilliant i wish the movie received more awards i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was close to her parents
<START> like many people on this site i saw this movie only once when it was first televised in 1971 certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how i remember being affected by it i would be fascinated to see it again if it was ever made available for home video br br possible spoiler i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 british movie originally titled city of the dead retitled horror hotel for the american release there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man br br one detail remains with me years after seeing the film it's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film as i recall a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road circa 1870 somewhere out west the friendly seeming ray milland introduces himself and his daughter yvette mimieux a beautiful young mute woman while the preacher is helping ray milland with the wagon a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly unobserved by any of the characters except yvette mimieux she doesn't look scared at all but stares at the snake with silent concentration until it goes away with this strange little moment we already realize there's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time br br that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years along with many others the film has a haunting quality about it that won't let go and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly someone ought to make this available for home video
<START> dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father br br several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder jack's search leads him through a trail of beep that doesn't end until everyone is dead br br through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels the game play is basically kill 30 people find switch to open door kill 50 people find switch to open door over and over until the level is done there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club or bomb disarming br br dead to rights is also a hard game you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck br br dead to rights is as gory as it is hard if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls ceiling and floor and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood br br family fun for everyone
<START> this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldn't explain the blood and gore the only good part they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but don't say i didn't warn you two things how could vinny say welcome when he didn't have a tongue its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role second thing that bugged me why were we shown vinny jones' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role why not i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldn't waste my time wish i'd have watched mirrors instead
<START> if derivative and predictable rape revenge thrillers are your thing then you're in for a rare treat they don't really appeal to me so i couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale it seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near rape and by his work on documentaries but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer i don't think i was the only person in the cinema laughing what i can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film filmfour and verve pictures both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years verve distributed bullet boy code 46 and red road straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath filmfour and verve take note is this really the best you can do what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement it's a big blot on both of your reputations listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair
