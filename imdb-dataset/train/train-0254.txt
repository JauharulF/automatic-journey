<START> spoilers through br br i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating br br perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original br br there were a few things i liked about it one was the casting of kowalkski viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was this was a great role for him br br another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television i had no idea this was the case when watching it it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release br br i also found the story to be very absorbing i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama mysticism a love story quirky people every which way you turned i didn't even recognize priestly and it was touching this was not a great movie but it is watchable br br and then there's the ending it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end i am not sure how i feel about the ending the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie br br so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which i don't usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plot could the villains have been anymore stereotypical but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well however having said that i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because though i have not seen the original i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results my big dislike is actually sequels but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality br br people have compared this to smoky and the bandit how about a road version of legends of the fall meets thelma and louese as well i sure felt touches of both films both of which i'm a fan of i do not think however that this was a great film it was better then average to me but far from great but it was an absorbing adrenalin fueled touching movie with excellent casting of the main character my vote is 7 of 10
<START> yep lots of shouting screaming cheering arguing celebrating fist clinching high fiving fighting you have a general idea as to why but can never be 100 certain a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points but then you'd probably spot the many flaws not an awful film hackman washington are their usual brilliant but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on i'm still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other don't argue but then you probably wouldn't have a film br br 4 10
<START> david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication the troubled talent and it is a role he plays well br br this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene but that aside a movie worth seeing
<START> seriously i'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as goodfellas but this movie it doesn't make any sense and i'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense why does her family live in england or at the very least why doesn't she have a british accent she's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years on that subject no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long and what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party i'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her that could've been overcome by better movie making i'm just saying that the characters the setting and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story oh and the worst part in my opinion is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on deborah messing's nose i'd have sued the filmmakers if i were her i mean honestly i'm all for women being who they are but why in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is oh because those producers are kind to her this movie like my other least favorite movie ever armageddon is the fault of the filmmakers not the actors i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better writer director and producer br br this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i've ever wasted time on i'm just glad a friend loaned me her dvd so all i wasted was time if there were a way to make this review zero stars i'd do it
<START> this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this movie there was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
<START> wow this film is truly awful i can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast the story is disjointed fragmented and incoherent the telling leaden and predictable no wit no charm no humour not sexy in the least the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake there's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on when your lead carrell is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there despite it's phony turn around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed
<START> i found a dvd of i dream of jeanie in the 1 00 bin at wal mart when i saw that it was the story of stephen foster being a musician and music educator i had to see it i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover just that it was a remake of 1939's sewanee river bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful sometimes laughable the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs without paying him for them in addition to that ridiculous notion there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black faced christy minstrels performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch to say the least i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten fortunately stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten also eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history
<START> to me this was more a wake up call and realization that most all we see hear read and think about most anything is dependent on what the media feeds us this is a classic example of high level spin doctors attempting to control the masses through controlled information it is also an excellent example of how people that have a constitution that they freely bought in to will not be swayed by this media control or any attempted mis information once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will in fact outweigh the needs of the few it is also enlightening to see that in in a country where there is no religious civil war going on that democracy is not a real hard thing to implement
<START> stewart kane gabriel byrne vanity fair heads out with his local jindabyne australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest recreation and relaxation but when stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face down in a river things appear to have turned out for the worst the largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense they don't hike out of the ravine and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches then they head out and report the body br br the town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess the local media swarms them and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives stewart's wife claire laura linney the exorcism of emily rose senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did but has to battle with it through her own mental illness br br amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle splayed out on a morgue slab her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of jindabyne a division of men and women black and white social and outcast br br the only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids stewart and claire's son who is being led around by a half breed aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before the young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can and the discovery of a new body seems Â strangely enough Â a method in which to accomplish this again the underlying current of jindabyne is surmised br br everything and everyone in this jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of jindabyne under its surface none that is until claire forces them to br br the movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted there are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done too many loose threads the acting was okay but the filming was terrible wobbly cameras grainy or dark shots and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production br br i enjoy symbolic films northfork being one of my all time favorites in that vein but jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems which simply didn't happen
<START> how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production br br i don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow and no one knows how to stop the car yeah right br br the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word check out the acting skills of the bridge operator pure oscar material
<START> written and directed by steve gordon running time 97 minutes classified pg br br it was the quintessential comedy of the decade it won sir john gielgud the academy award it was even featured in vh1's i love the 80's and it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire played with enthusiasm and wit by dudley moore in an oscar nominated performance who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to while the basic plot is one big cliche there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce arthur bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk but you can't help but like him especially when he delivers lines such as don't you wish you were me i know i do he's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen he's not ashamed of being filthy rich in one scene a man asks him what does it feel like to have all that money to which he responds it feels great moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience and gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional it just comes naturally the screenplay which also earned a nod from the academy is saturated with authentic laugh out loud dialogue this is the kind of movie that when together with a bunch of poker buddies you quote endlessly to one another it also looks at its characters with sincere empathy there have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star including both grumpy old men's but few can carry it off because we just don't care when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler it actually works because we genuinely like these people why should you see arthur the answer is simple because it's an all around non guilty pleasure at a period in which films are becoming more and more serious arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time br br classic
<START> i saw an interview with rob schneider who plays the lead character marvin mange in this film he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you'd be laughing at this movie obviously that must be the secret i had the volume turned up i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster and completely unfunny a major disappointment after schneider's hilarious performance in deuce bigalow male gigolo br br the story is stupid mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr wilder michael caton and as a result starts to lose control of his animal instincts this makes him a supercop he can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses of course he also has a nasty habit of eating people's cows and trying to seduce their goats but surely that's a small price to pay it just didn't do anything for me br br the cast left much to be desired is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley here he plays sgt sisk mange's commander on the police force as a repugnantly cartoonish character much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series scrubs i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell's first serious acting job can anything in this movie be called serious she of course gained her fame as a contestant on the first survivor and she proves here what we knew from that she's cute as a button what she doesn't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress and what's with ed asner as police chief wilson i mean how old is this guy now he's the size of some of the cows mange tried to eat and he seemed out of breath the whole way through i'm surprised he made it through the filming there's a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler who also served as executive producer of this br br anyway i chuckled twice mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan the orangutan has more acting talent so for two chuckles 2 10
<START> i have to say i was very curious on viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th century fox in 1970 it has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films and this only deepened an interest as i just had to see what made this movie so bad upon seeing it i think i have my answers although i will say it does make for curious viewing the acting direction and script are so laughingly bad that the supposed satire is completely missing racquel welch seems to try to carry the film but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone john huston as uncle buck loner is certainly no help as he licks and leers at the screen he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there rex reed bounces around as myron myra's alter ego and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene bravo for debut performances farrah fawcett plays a dumb blonde she certainly seemed convincing in this role but of course arguably the most notorious role went to mae west the sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film i don't mean to put this cast down personally but in this film no one comes out looking good the direction seems so unassured and non existent that the film is not only bad but boring as well throw in some old film footage of old stars and the movie becomes even more disconnected to each his own to anyone that enjoyed this and i was glad i at least saw it but myra breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning
<START> the only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches br br moderate spoiler alert death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in twilight zone the movie which delivers death by cartoon still this was handled nicely especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out br br additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle br br having said that i was glad i got the dvd cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful i bought soul survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream however where soul survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above br br interestingly the dvd lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this the scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable br br 3 out of 10
<START> well chuck jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an american drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir don't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less don't dump all over their original creators dreams yes and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more but won't every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay you're right set it in the future make them all descendent's of the original characters and change all the names slightly but not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics br br well that's the only reason i can think of why this even exists if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons then it looks like an ok show but then there is already the teen titan's which is the same bloody thing all the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traits br br this kind of thing falls into the it's so ridiculous it's good kind of category think of the super mario brother's movie and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out if you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoy br br if you enjoy this cartoon i don't have a problem with you it's the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up inÂerr pirate costumes and charged money if this show wasn't using characters ones that didn't resemble the looney toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine but no for shame warner brothers for shame br br if i saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the simpson's or family guy i would love it as it is i just can't believe this was ever made i would bet anyone that 80 of the people who work on this show hate it but whatever it doesn't really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on foreverÂor at least until the world ends br br coming 2008 snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar tune in and see
<START> another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never ending crop of crud emanating from hollywood this is a story of life and living no definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial hollywood movies but rather the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves br br the dynamics of all of these lives intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse and particularly its aged owner are magnificent heart touching and highly thought provoking br br sit back relax and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life there is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it br br you will not be disappointed
<START> as a sequel this is not a bad movie i actually liked it better than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the 1st one did not have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for return to cabin by the lake is 7 10
<START> the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly our main actress orked was seen in a chinese language class later in the film she was asked on why by mukhsin that she was sent to learn mandarin her answer was simple for a child she is coz she's already known the malay language well br br it's a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once you've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it you'll notice the typical elements of malaysia the movie basically focuses on 10 year old orked who met 12 year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy's game running out of players mukhsin who was new in that village was forced to allow orked into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school bullies throwing one of the bully's bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on mukhsin's brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town br br now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin they started out as friends but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr you would notice the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you'd be stuck on the screen for a long time you will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes coz it means much more br br as the movie envelopes around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards orked's parents her mother who was educated in england speaks very good english and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english which was humor all the way indeed let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness often more than not we don't learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned often when we are ourselves we don't see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another person's body then only would we learn to see who we really are and that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignity br br the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be br br the other focus of this movie was on how orked's neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another pak koboi as what he's nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it having interrupting on other people's business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use after all what goes around comes around and that's probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her in every time being nice to people around you won't hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again what's it worth the movie also centers around mukhsin's brother hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding 'girls' he's the total opposite of mukhsin but that's all perhaps because of family problems both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all she wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the character's position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you
<START> this is one of those movies that's trying to be moody and tense and instead ends up tripping all over itself having seen it at a queer film festival i was intrigued by the young college threesome gone wrong write up however over all ended up quite disappointed br br it's hard to critique a true story since there's not much that can be done about the plot but i found this disjointed melodramatic and wholly depressing it's dark and almost sinister painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close ups it just doesn't work some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes br br the story has an interesting premise but this just spins downward into a dark miserable spiral
<START> not a movie but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond but a lot of them did featured are herman's hermits billy j kramer and the dakotas peter and gordon honeycombs nashville teens animals and of course the beatles br br it is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts
