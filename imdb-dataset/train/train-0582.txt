<START> another rape of history br br this movie is a catastrophe it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story with bad acting and low budget production br br the movie should be 1 3 the time they just dragged the time to make a mini series br br the battle scenes are so stupid and illogical the solders log stupid the costumes a catastrophe the romans were good in fighting in opened areas one of their armies was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest in this movie the romans choose to fight in side the city i mean get real br br and by the way cleopatra was from a macedonian origin which means a light skinned person
<START> spoilers br br a buddy of mine said next movie was the best cheech chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and the blues brothers next movie has no plot has no pacing really has no anything of what defines a movie but it is funny and for what it is worth cheech and chong show some heart br br well in this little paragraph i put in the plot but being that four fifths of the movie nothing happens that would usually start a story i will just say that cheech 's cousin shows up br br was there no other funnier moment when chong made cheech drink the pee twice what about the rooster was that pee wee herman's first movie appearance you would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it i don't think next movie has strong enough balls to make it awesome but the movie has heart and hey my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7
<START> this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget fonda's acting is decent but everyone else's acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut scenes bad transitions and acting that should have been re shot read the book and don't waste your time with this film
<START> i saw an american in paris on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since both in the cinema and on tv it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century george gershwin and features the greatest male gene kelly and female leslie caron dancers in hollywood history the supporting cast of oscar levant as quirky as ever georges guetary why didn't he make more movies and nina foch brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form the closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post impressionist artists all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are it's very clear caron and kelly on the banks of the seine and i got rhythm the kids of paris joining gene kelly in une chanson americaine if you love paris see this movie if you've never been to paris in your life see it but see it
<START> i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director gregor jordan buffalo soldiers basically ned kelly heath ledger is set up by the police especially superintendent francis hare geoffrey rush he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names that's really all i can say about the story as i wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne naomi watts as julia cook laurence kinlan as dan kelly philip barantini as steve hart joel edgerton as aaron sherritt kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick kerry condon as kate kelly emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what it's worth and the film does have it's eye catching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i can't say i enjoyed it as i didn't look at it all okay
<START> my favorite part of this film was the old man's attempt to cure his neighbor's ills by putting the strong medicine in his bath there is more than a sense of family there is a sense of community
<START> i didn't really expect much from the night listener and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore however the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension on occasion it drags a little but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly when as the movie progresses the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of cat and mouse spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no one seemed to have ever seen in person the night listener is an interesting story which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real however in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had it doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character which would have been helpful and interesting

<START> cinderella br br i hadn't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it the magic remains there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel the songs entertain and the secondary character's all please the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile then there is the most magical of all disney the mice making the dress and well you know the rest to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience watch and enjoy oh and of course cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie br br if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it you simply can't help but smile br br they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper's in this film it's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling br br and of course the rest is cinderella
<START> this movie is a ripoff of james cain's novel the postman always rings twice apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties despite this the movie isn't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie in some ways it's a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not br br the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people in fact the male and female lovers are a bit icky looking the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive they are a very very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version and the ill fated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtless and his counterpart in the american film cecil kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads actually and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed dish like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway i am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers whereas the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable br br part of the italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway they never actually get around to sex this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic in addition to the casual sexuality of the film it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life with lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath br br the movie is also pretty fast paced compared to the over long american film and what you get due to brevity isn't all good the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film with grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets it sure ain't a pretty film but the neo realistic like style makes the film seem more realistic but it cannot make up for the short cuts in the plot many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american film br br so which is the better film well a lot of this probably depends on you as for me the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles but it packed a great ending and the italian film was much much more realistic until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed so neither film is exactly great but i'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better it's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film
<START> i made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago god i'm still trying to recover this movie does not even deserve a 1 4 average imdb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one a 1 4 is too high br br i had heard how awful this movie was but i really did not think a movie could actually be that bad especially in this day and era i figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s my god was i wrong trust me folks this movie really is that bad it is beyond horrible it is beyond pathetic it is beyond any type of word that i can think of for it battlefield earth looks like best picture of the year compared to this movie snake island which up until now was the worst movie i'd ever seen looks like it deserves a few oscars compared to this pathetic effort br br i seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a hollywood movie this has no business being called a movie in the first 25 seconds of the film i seriously thought i was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie or better yet i thought it was some saturday night live ripoff skit of the real thing i mean it looks exactly like that the acting is horrible the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old vhs video camera the special effects well good lord bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie the scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy i mean seriously my intro to acting class from 4 years ago in college all of us could have put together a better movie than this and the worst part of the entire movie where arthur is naked in the bathroom oh my god i almost thew up right there i have a strong stomach but wow that was horrible some people should never be naked and he's one of them the plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere they talk about legal issues that we never hear about again ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop everything about the movie is just horrible br br this really doesn't have much to do with my critique but just so everyone knows i am not a gay man i do however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals and i would support any gay person in my church unlike the cruel priest in this movie who by the way seems to cuss every other word where is the f ing white out hahaha but i didn't want anyone to think i hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys it has nothing to do with that this would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was ben jill instead of ben arthur br br i just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say and yes it was even worse than i had read let this be a warning to everyone only watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be if you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment i have no sympathy for you whatsoever br br on a final thought how in the world are there 7 movies ranked below this on imdb there is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this
<START> john cassavetes' 1977 film opening night is what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist 'overlooked' it is an excellent film in its own right and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film it's not a perfect film in that at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long and there's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon played by gena rowlands the wife of cassavetes long after we've gotten the point but only woody allen's masterpiece another woman which also starred rowlands eleven years later is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman yet rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal and it was well deserved often this film written by cassavetes is easily compared to his earlier and inferior film a woman under the influence but it's a spurious comparison rowlands' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start as well as coming from a blue collar background while her characters in this film and in allen's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions in this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtle's younger doppelganger while in allen's film it's her character's own pastÂ many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic seeing myrtle surround herself with enablers such as a stage manager who tells her during opening night 'i've seen a lot of drunks in my time but i've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up you're great ' but this is wrong for alcohol isn't her problem nor is her chain smoking they are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction and much to cassavetes' credit as a storyteller he never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with myrtle and despite her coming through in the end there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence this sort of end without resolution links cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience and forcing their viewers to cogitate even if it hurts br br yet the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama whether or not myrtle gordon does recover after the film's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide and as we have seen before that lid closes one's choices do matter
<START> ever since seeing this film as a child over 30 years ago i never tire of watching it from the opening scenes in the horn factory to the car motor running from the back seat of the car to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan i think this was perhaps their best latter day film after this they moved to 20th century fox and while those films weren't terrible they lacked the comic timing of this movie jimmy finnlayson their long time foil in his last appearance with the boys showing up as the doctor is super quote i said goat milk his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost charlie hall and even ben turpin show up i'd say all in all one of my favorite l h comedies

<START> nicole eggert was listed as the star of this despite micheal dorn stacey keach being much bigger stars than her br br basically this is a bit of a spin on the alien lands on earth film eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise a bit of nudity and partial nudity a pointless sex scene all feature along the way br br the film stumbles through a few obvious set pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene br br it was fairly obvious that stacey keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to eggert
<START> this tiresome plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in it's something you 'look at' if you have absolutely nothing else better to do the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she'll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears many great shots of mid 70s las vegas when it was still a cool place to visit and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well otherwise one big yawn the rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ain't worth it in my humble opinion
<START> as a gamer i can't say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group br br to me there are several reasons why br br 1 the characters seem unnatural i've met lots of players of all different walks of life i don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film it's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active lives br br 2 the style doesn't work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking i e cleanly put together it isn't very good br br 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear i'll admit that but we don't have tourette's syndrome br br 4 the humor is lacking while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i've encountered this is less self deprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes br br 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don't mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that's definitely like gary
<START> any movie that shows federal pigs persons in government to be the power mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me br br alas the script supervision and editing and even at times the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments br br i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it despised it loathed it thought it was a terrible irrational piece of junk br br now though i don't remember why br br i believe the two should not be compared or even connected br br consider them as two different movies br br rate them as two different movies br br this vanishing point provides a rallying place a banner for people who want to encourage individualism who believe in human rights who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is especially the federal government br br the voice wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire live free or die at one time it would have been the motto of most americans br br despite its obvious flaws vanishing point is a film to cheer
<START> a low budget effort from texas that's at least filmed well but that is little consolation bad acting or should i say bad over acting a pretty limp story line that's nothing new bad special effects bad bad bad seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween which is done every year but this year things are different has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots of which there are a lot putrid puerile definitely avoidable at all costs
<START> utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a drop dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull string doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling late night feature this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat anti heroes alain delon and charles bronson really they don't get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy mid section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10 000 possible combinations oh fun but this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronson's characters after a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve ball still their encounters early on suggest there's more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that 'what just happen there ' ending that might just make you jump yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh glad to get that out of the system br br the pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting the taut complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good but there are some neat novelties coins glass and liquidsÂ try not spilling and visual symbolisms jean herman's direction is efficiently sophisticated and low key but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere the sound fx features more as a potent note than that of francois deroubaix's funky score that's mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening top drawers delon who's quite steely and bronson a jovial turn are solid and work off each tremendously bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows there's more going on than what is being led on an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georges picot br br a cryptically directionless but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions
