<START> this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing br br well directed well acted of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you'll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better all in all 8 10
<START> warning don't even consider watching this film in any form it's not even worth downloading from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the so called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives it's an insult to any human being if you're looking for a fun filled movie go look somewhere else br br let's hope this mr unterwaldt the jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slow painful death and never makes a film again br br in fact it's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap that's why i'll stop right now and rather watch a good film
<START> got to this show late believe it was the 3rd and final episode when first watched it and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn't been seen on american tv since 'all in the family' br br was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place br br which is merely to say the last time cbs 'had a set' if you know what i mean was back in the day of 'all in the family' the most controversial decision they're willing to tackle today is how much eye make up to put on katie couric br br if you want to make a bunch of folks really really mad let them discover the truth about themselves and if you want them willing to pull strings make calls and get a work of art removed let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths br br the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve and this show is no different somehow it snuck under the cbs 'corporate social political censor radar' to get it onto the schedule perhaps the 'big brass' never really watched it till it finally aired but once good 'ol middle 'merika heard and saw themselves being themselves well can bet the farm that message or the messenger won't last long br br now if only the 'missing episodes' can find their way onto usenet or bit torrent br br thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla
<START> very good western this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the townÂ´s businesses there are some similarities in the story with warlock which was made in 1959 this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge
<START> i love buying those cheap lousy dvd's from alpha video one day i happened to buy this one it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's all sexed up replete with unscientific everything scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama it's an enjoyable film to those who appreciate this kind of stuff and if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough you can actually get creeped out not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet but toward the end with the character of 'the perfect body' it's so what's another word for mindf ing
<START> it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school if you liked this movie then i would suggest you watch valentine i just found out today that the guy who played marty simon killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it when he was changing in the showers carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready camera electric shock pole when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling they picked him up dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed and they electricuted him slightly when the kids are in detention given by the coach 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was the lab blows up disfiguring him badly 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded one by one the people get killed off i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned she could have gotten back up after marty left she almost got out the first time
<START> by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynnâs hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually â adventures of don juan 1948 â but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways â albeit for a modestly budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers âaâ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peakâ¦ br br still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen oâhara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie â the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 â a viewing of which preceded this one â against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels br br for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie iâve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of todayâs generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but itâs a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it â despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars â is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the kingâs pirate 1967 with doug mcclure br br for what itâs worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out âpirates of the golden age movie collectionâ set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneerâs girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald oâconnor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytykâs mutiny 1952 the afore mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961
<START> i won't say this movie was bad but it wasn't good either i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love br br despite of being engaged they have to take permission for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many meetings i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was crib madly br br hey we have kids too but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream happy family one cruel woman good in laws and a man who loves her to death in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie anyway i believe i wasted my time i give it a 2 10
<START> as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view if you've never watched this show you're in for an extended treat yes there is violence and nudity but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano the thinking man's gangster with the reality of the life he has been born to and quite frankly would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew take a break sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football even carmella his wife when given a chance for a way out finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own if you followed the whole thing you know how it ends if you didn't trust me you've never seen a tv show end like this
<START> may contain spoilers br br all dogs go to heaven is a great movie i saw it in 1989 when i was two years old i didn't understand it that well but as i saw it more and more times i started to love it i love the songs in this movie my favorite songs are let me be surprised and soon you'll come home those are beautiful songs the only thing that bothers me about the movie is charlie dieing when i was little my sister couldn't even watch that part other than that this movie is wonderful br br my favorite part of the movie is when annabelle and charlie are flying around heaven heaven is beautiful in the movie and the clocks are very clever i also love itchy in fact i have 3 dachshunds of my own they are so cute br br overall i love this movie and suggest everyone should see it i give this movie 10 10 stars
<START> i guess that gunslinger wasn't quite as god awful as most of the movies that mystery science theater 3000 shows but westerns just aren't roger corman's forte portraying rose hood beverly garland becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies the movie is pretty predictable john ireland is rose's new hubby secretly working for unctuous allison hayes yes the 50 foot woman also appearing briefly is frequent corman co star dick miller as a mailman miller nowadays stars in joe dante's movies br br i do wish to assert that you'll probably want to watch the mst3k version to really enjoy this movie they had a great time with it
<START> every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize 1 my life isn't as bad as i thought it was and 2 how important it is to adopt a child in need there are so many out there to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be corrupt but that corruption doesn't have to reach your home we all have a choice definitely recommend this one and while you're at it i'd like to throw in the color purple and woman thou art loosed by t d jakes br br these are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life
<START> i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery but i did really like the concept if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie that said having just watched the restored 137 minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it though not as much as when i was seven i remembered the ending br br there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music listen to the lyrics br br for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing when seven i though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing br br for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of shogun era warriors the makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and lets face it humorous i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid and i am not ashamed to say that i still do br br i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum they've got heavy calibre machine guns mortars rocket launchers a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal japan theirs which is what i'd like to think any vigorous imdb user would do in their boots br br in short the movies worth watching it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like g i samurai is so unique
<START> while bondarchuk was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project he was still a novice director with only a single pictures a successful adaptation of a short wwii story to his name bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale and it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes often unfortunate camera positions performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements br br vidor's war and peace was probably the main reason that prompted the soviet government to spare no expense on this production the ussr release of the vidor's picture made quite a splash certainly bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the hollywood film and find his own audrey his final choice lyudmila savelyeva a big eyed sprightly dark haired thing indeed somewhat resembles hepburn unfortunately she was a kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent so unsurprisingly the most kind word that i can find to describe her performance is awful br br though it might be expected that soviet actors speaking the same language as tolstoy's characters would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this war and peace often proves that not to be the case the revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of russian cultural soil that the world of war and peace grown out of so a good share of these big name soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as americans performing shakespeare i don't mean of course that american actors can't possibly play shakespeare credibly but you'll know what i mean if you witnessed american members of the cast in branagh's adaptations of the three main characters only bondarchuk's pierre is commendable but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going
<START> if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film i recommend the following br br dragon the bruce lee story br br rapa nui br br timecop 2 the berlin decision is an awful film awful production values awful acting awful script i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood this film does neither br br i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing if you are curious perhaps a rental from netflix but this film is definitely not for keeps br br if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness and came away disappointed then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing these are well written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors br br better luck tomorrow br br mulan
<START> they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life this accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry far fetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it
<START> from the what was she thinking file whoopi goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age straight to tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous a high concept in search of itself apparently this was a labor of love for its writer director jonathan betuel who also served as one of the producers sadly the end results are anemic to be charitable goldberg's mere presence on screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results no stars from
<START> mary poppins is definitely much better but this is a lovely film nonetheless angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price and david tomlinson has great fun as mr brown their chemistry was just brilliant as well the children however just lacked the same sparkle though paul is very funny and cute the songs were actually not as bad as some people say beautiful briny sea is the best in fact all the songs are outstanding the special effects were wonderful that had plenty of magic and the story is original enough the highlights though like mary poppins were the animated sequences the underwater sequence was beautiful but my favourite was the football match which was absolutely hilarious the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it all in all a lovely film that is hardly ever on 8 10 bethany cox
<START> the man from snowy river ii doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes br br for those fans wanting the elements that made the original man from snowy river film a hit breathtaking scenery sweeping score sweet romanticism and cracking action this film really delivers this story picks up a few years from the end of the first jim tom burlinson has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses he returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well bred sweetheart jessica played by aussie divine lady sigrid thornton who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station harrison is now played by american brian dennehy the foil to jim and character that shakes the plot is the well to do upper class snob alistair patton nicholas eadie who has his sights on jessica add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot br br the best thing about this film is the acting tom burlinson fits snugly into jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour sigrid thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen filling the solid shoes of kirk douglas was never going to be easy and brian dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part br br the music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a victoria tourism reel there are moment however that feel very self indulgent like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama a little more grit would have sufficed here we are aussie's we can take it there are some very jawsish moments with the stallion that defy belief however the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichÃ©s there are some really inventive and touching scenes jim putting the saddle on the stallion very horse whisperish before its time jim and jessica setting up home the fabulous scene where jim shows up alistair's riding with his trusty whip i can see why this character is such an icon br br altogether a very pleasing sequel here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another the man from snowy river iii the craigs i'm sure we'd all love to see how jim and jessica are doing on their farm br br the aussie dvd has a couple of extra scenes in it worthwhile if you are already a fan
<START> the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts demons named brother dominic francesco carnelutti is found dead cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier heath ledger is contacted by top brass cardinal driscoll peter weller who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominic's death along with his girlfriend mara willims shannyn sossamon fellow priest thomas garrett mark addy alex travels to italy to delve into his mentor's death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a 'sin eater' someone who absorbed other's sins lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully that the church wasn't happy about his activities alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes br br also know under the title the sin eater this american german co production was written produced directed by bian helgeland didn't really do that much for me if i'm honest i usually am honest that is anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it's throughly predictable excruciatingly dull boring really silly at times it takes itself far too seriously the whole concept is daft while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious lazy way to end things there's the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief prophecy's blah blah blah you know the sort of thing then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clichÃ©d hollywood ideals themes that get reused every time it deals with the church the order has nothing new to say as a serious piece of film making it sucks a lot i'm not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to as a die hard horror fan i didn't see much horror in this at all as a thriller it's less than thrilling as a mystery it's too predictable there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting action packed as the average episode of sesame street 1969 present harsh maybe but it's what i think br br director helgeland does an ok job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme it all looks a bit drab grayish dull for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason don't ask forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable according the imdb's 'trivia' section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now br br i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about 28 000 000 which is a hell of a lot of money i just can't see where it all went apart from the sets production design which are good the whole film looks feels very average utterly forgettable the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul mouthed comic relief irritates a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than this br br the order i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i'm concerned is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it not recommended
