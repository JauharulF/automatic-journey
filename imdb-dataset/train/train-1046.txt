<START> based on the idea from gackt moon child took place in a poverty stricken country called mallepa in a futuristic timeline the story followed the lives of the two main characters kei hyde and sho gackt and their friends growing up together br br despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship even amongst all the hardships between each character in the end each of them wanted to have someone on their side to have friends br br unlike most vampire characters kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy sho who's not afraid of kei regardless of what some might've thought i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives on the other hand sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games that death exists and able to take away his loved ones br br i love the part where lee hom the actor who played son first appeared on the screen the way they met up was quite cool indeed son also has a big part within this movie the fact that he's from a different race a taiwanese made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie br br i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs they've done great acting jobs moon child really made an impact for me it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes the movie shows a lot of hope despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that there's always hope life can be cruel that it seems hope doesn't exist anymore it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other even when son became the enemy sho did have some sort of fun at their last battle every single one of them desired peace in the end no matter how far apart they've become the ending scene showed it to us
<START> there is a lot of talk of torture these days that's all this movie is it's about a good person who makes a bad decision because of his kindness he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women from then on its a just for kicks assault on him i don't know at what point you do something about it there is a wife and child out there somewhere he has great feelings of guilt and fear but there should have been some times when he could have acted the movie seems to be somebody's joke i suppose in the wake of the manson murders we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two nevertheless why would someone make a film like this what appeals does it have except for sadism the conclusion is totally unsatisfying but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist oh well another hour and a half of my life
<START> i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot i'm an open minded guy after all and iâve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say here goes this film was mercifully short that's all i got br br okay okay the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd br br by the time of the chicken dance at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall i don't know what could have salvaged this film the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film either way i'm not watching this film again unless i'm really depressed then i can tell myself âat least i wasnât in âdr tarr's torture dungeon â iâm better than those guys
<START> jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming talking movies br br this story of love deceit women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done the story never really got lost in this frantic pace br br some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time br br jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never loosing his composure as the ever working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest nan she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change br br the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end these were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didn't seem to fit in the story the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater in this way the sitting on a backyard fence was much more appropriate to the story br br the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well br br all in all a great film with a sour ending br br 9 10
<START> excellent film the whole picture was filmed in budapest so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways mÃv and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations apart from this the film is superb
<START> good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman i almost always like the movies she's in this was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy truth about cats dogs maybe they're too implausible ebert didn't even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible bringing up baby etc if you've seen one implausible comedy you've seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s weird birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer app for home video
<START> this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman mark hamil as the joker etc the villains are really good such as the joker two face catwoman clayface etc so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it's touch and go whether you should revisit it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober br br the first power is not a very good movie sad to say it's chock full of those cop clichÃ©s and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the over confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case br br ahhh this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70's demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and i've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor br br the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a brain switch off is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i'll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy
<START> director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like 'greedy' and 'clue' this isn't one of them more akin to a 'police academy' film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act nothing much happens really it's all quite dull it's not very funny martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin material
<START> i did not expect much from this film but boy o boy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they don't show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh
<START> god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i'm a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron
<START> in this excellent twentieth century fox film noir the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism br br a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway it contains a microfilm and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information br br anti hero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors so he taunts them go on he says to captain dan tiger murvyn vye drum up a charge throw me in you've done it before in this pitiless world the cops are just one more gang on the streets just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information br br it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age the 39 year old star coming to the end of his contract with fox plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face but by the mores of the period it signified toughness and candy after all is a fallen woman br br jean peters is radiant as candy here right in the middle of her five year burst of b movie fame she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart she is the story's victim a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else she means well but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men joey skip and the cops br br the real star of this movie is new york haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living malevolent force like maggots in a rotting cheese human figures scurry through the city's byways elevators subway turnstiles sidewalks even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity people cling to any niche that affords safety moe has her grimy rented room skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river as the characters move and interact they are framed by bridge architecture or lattices of girders or are divided by hanging winch tackle the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan and the card index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline when joey's exit from the subway is barred it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him br br a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close up character drives the plot as it should and the close ups are used to augment character when skip interrogates candy the close up captures the sexual energy between them belying the hostility of skip's words jean peters' beauty is painted in light in exquisite soft focus close ups the device is also employed to heighten the tension the opening sequence the purse snatch contains no dialogue the drama relies entirely on close up for its powerful effect br br snoopers and snoopers upon snoopers populate the film moe thelma ritter makes a living as an informant and her place in the hierarchy is accepted even by her victims when skip observes she's gotta eat he is chanting a recurring refrain just as 'straight' new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber the underworld traffics in the commodity of information br br and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends joey's feet on moe's bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code joey is beyond the pale moe will not trade with joey even to preserve her life even in our crummy business you gotta draw the line somewhere br br pick up was made in the depths of the cold war richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vice presidential candidate having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose bogus communist microfilm and all the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality we see the cops in the movie inveigh against the traitors who gave stalin the a bomb br br new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats squeals and murders containers form a leitmotif throughout the film moe carries her trade mark box of ties and candy's purse container of the microfilm is the engine of the plot skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate symbolising his secretive street wisdom the paupers' coffins moving down the hudson on a barge are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis br br the film is a masterpiece of composition candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack signifying her moral ascendancy when the gun is placed on the table the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy violence is beginning to dwarf compassion the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore's hook reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage a predatory phantom of the night camera shots from under taxi hoods inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis we are civilisation's mulch
<START> was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun truly i love documentaries so we started watching it at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another kleenex then cried some more once jonni kennedy's time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart
<START> rumour has it that around the time that abba Â the multi award winning swedish disco favourites Â's star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue soon after problems began to emerge in the onetime wed locked watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent the band dissolved albeit unofficially in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists although they have never admitted that there's any truth in those rumours the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue if you want to appeal to the largest money making media market in the entire world then you must cater for english speaking audiences br br it's amazing for me how such a small island that's located a stone throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world everyone speaks a little bit of english whether it be simply 'hello' or a common swear word you'll find an english speaker almost everywhere pedro galindo obviously didn't agree because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd that's a real shame because it's actually a decent slasher movie that's a lot better than many of its english speaking genre compatriots br br the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown after some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft spoken opponent but as of yet he hasn't succeeded br br later that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partner br br they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary br br after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store keeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland hunters become hunted as they learn that the 'bear' is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin br br i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room next door to me i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled which meant i never got to see the final scenes thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection br br gallindo's slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac's playground br br despite gallindo's obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a claw fingered glove a la freddy kruegar trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown from here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'the majorettes' which is not necessarily a good thing br br as is the case with many latin films especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer's throat over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner it's a sugar coated point but it's handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature br br trampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentine style mask and the attempts at originality just about work it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing
<START> why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century with great acting directing effects music and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic
<START> if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s in l a then you've missed a special treat this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in it covers everything from raising a child prejudice more than one way love adultery empty nest syndrome selfishness etc and the list goes on this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life makes us ask questions of ourselves have we done enough for others are we like this etc sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime br br take note of mary mcdonnell kevin kline and danny glover's wonderful performance through this whole film these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now i still enjoy it again and again also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie hmmm i almost forgot this is probably steve martin's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done he too does an excellent job in this movie this may come as a surprise to most of you sit back relax and enjoy truly good film making
<START> have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more even from a score of 5 8 imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting don't waist your time this movie Ã­snt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy br br i give this 2 10 it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isn't
<START> the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her the films wipes away the i am not amused impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman br br as i love history particularly victorian history you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas i was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate but it was and i loved it i found out new facts about queen victoria that didn't know before and it interested me greatly br br queen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest monarchs and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like she was treated so badly by her mothers adviser sir john conroy because he wanted britain to have a regency this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen which she was the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend who were both brilliant the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history i love it 10 10 no doubt
<START> this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non latinos there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill but the script is incredibly shallow and lame you actually hear serious dialogue that goes i love you more no i love you more i stopped watching the movie online after the first half hour i couldn't take it anymore her southern girl charm just doesn't work and is really quite annoying her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page br br poor luke wilson did he not read the script before agreeing to do this or did he fall for papa joe's jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie promise of big profits hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this luke wilson is actually a good actor i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue br br also i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging br br jessica has lots of money right maybe buy some acting lessons
