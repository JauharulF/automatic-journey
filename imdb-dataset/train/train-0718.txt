<START> nicholas walker is paul the local town reverand who's married to martha ally sheedy but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair veronica dara tomanovich however in so doing he gets a bout of amnesia hence the name of the film sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of misery type of way it's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator in a film billed as a 'black comedy' one has to bring both elements into said movie while this does bring the former in spades it sadly contains none of the latter furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no vested interest in them technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one br br eye candy dara tomanovich gets topless sally kirkland also shows some skin br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime showcase
<START> a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young gay black artist br br if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is it's well directed fairly well written and for the most part well acted also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black white also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes not that explicit and no frontal still i mostly hated this br br the film meanders all over the place is full of unlikable characters including the main protagonist and this is the killer moves at a snails pace three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored but the director was there so i stayed br br his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete i really wish i could like this more there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks but i can't unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this
<START> you might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made for from the beginning since the credits list susan dey as special guest star um why would a one off mow like this have a guest star well if you stick with it you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but ms dey's butt wiggling in a flowered bikini as the partridge family house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes susan's derriÃ¨re is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene sadly susie and her tush fight a losing battle the jiggle tv craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role in 1976 fat freddy silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as susan's audition tape for charlie's angels as is our susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber neurotic women br br the view beyond susan's heinie it must be said is not very compelling the scenery is nice and photographed in a bizarre hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera nope it's just a typically suspense challenged 70's made for tv thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash and collect some cable residuals though they obviously didn't know that at the time and show off their range here we're treated to a tv scale nuclear family squaring off against tv scale thugs who can't decide whether they're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television don't mess with dennis weaver see mccloud and duel the only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage son character of steve played by the long forgotten if ever remembered kristoffer tabori who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is supposedly menacing his family but steve as played by tabori gosh why didn't we see more from this wunderkind is actually just grumpy and moody and isn't one bit conflicted when big d gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial and literal sand for the sleep deprived and susan deyniacs there must be some of you out there only
<START> saw this on sbs tv here in australia the other week where it was titled laputa castle in the sky i had enabled subtitles and i think sbs provided their own for that which as usual was of very good quality br br just looked up laputa on wikipedia and it confirms what i suspected the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic jonathan swift novel gulliver's travels which was published in the early to mid 1700s br br anyway this is an engaging japanese fairytale which features an english speaking voice cast it's suitable for young children i think but it does run at just over two hours in length so it may be too long for some though not for an adult like me br br the story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it the children are not the only ones looking for this island they have pirates the army and spies looking for the island too and looking to capture the children sheeta the girl voiced by anna paquin and pazu the boy voiced by james van der beek in order to help them find it br br the graphics are magnificent sort of photo realistic at times especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch light or the pretty scenes of bright sunny days with white clouds or mist br br recommended
<START> even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland you have to love my left foot and especially daniel day lewis' performance in it he plays cerebral palsy afflicted christy brown due to this he has spent most of his life ostracized even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part his left foot he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry bringing him to prominence br br daniel day lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration in the name of the father but the boxer was unnecessary my left foot can make you feel many ways sad hopeful or something else but in any case daniel day lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here a great movie in every sense
<START> i first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released room with a view was also newly out enchanted april had so much more to offer i found it much more real and earthy the characters more believable for being 'normal' by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting but in the heat of the spring in april everyone's lives loosen and unravel in line with the victorian corsets and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction what a little gem of a film how come it isn't more well known
<START> i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses it's slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few non important characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think oooo funny let's make some old lady's high on pot let's make them giggle let's make them behave like little children oooo yes that's absolutely brilliant and original br br this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years
<START> but the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying enjoy br br tom hulce is magnificent as dominick a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother eugene played by ray liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours br br due to eugene's work schedule dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls he really just wants to be a good boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started br br not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate but you hear it in a bar br br i thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie since he was for 'amadeus' i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning no such luck liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget
<START> saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent poor al looked really really haggard and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than pacino's close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re shoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters
<START> the guy who wrote directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change yes rob stefaniuk i mean you seriously who funded this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey but do it with style this movie is screaming 1995 saturday night live skits why i say again why do studios give money to hacks like rob stefaniuk never give a comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his own movie duh
<START> there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a killbot factory here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke but what patricia foulkrod's documentary does is show us scarily that it is not that far from the truth after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of 'me or them' since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who don't think of combatants as people to develop in them a most unnatural state the sustainable urge to kill br br first off this isn't an antiwar movie as such whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesn't get as much media attention as say the debate over the legality of a war or it's physical successes or failures the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being it's the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts especially vietnam painfully clear this isn't about any particular war it's about the problems caused by war in general br br structurally the film seems to be split into three sections how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive how they are treated once they are in combat and what happens once they leave the army once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple how word like democracy and freedom are banded around but once the training begins they become enemy and kill and destroy how once in action soldiers don't care what they are ordered to do as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order whatever it may be they are one step closer to going home they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that's what they've been trained to do br br but the ground truth's main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up this is the final indignity that once they are used they are cast away br br if there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesn't attempt to show another side to the argument you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome it would have been interesting to see those of aÂ less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known br br but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary and foulkrod's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war
<START> robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their 30's who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding russell somewhat reluctantly to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact williams is ok but russell is flat out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams' wife who could live without this rematch film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action highly recommended
<START> this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things parts of high tech equipment presumably it isn't really made very clear the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory and talking with his crew as he does so this is a world of relentless industrialization it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry 'our daily bread ' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e waste and a town many towns really being wiped out by the biggest dam ever with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is some of these scenes the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places might have been shot memorably by the premier engagÃ© photographer sebastiÃ£o salgado but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz br br all this happens in china of course though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive there are a good many stills of the photographer's work or were some of them made by the film crew it isn't made clear br br edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring he admits himself that he takes no political stand when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification and hence falsification but he is showing us places that if we look closely reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be br br logically but not entirely fortunately it is burtynsky whose voice overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites burtynsky's epiphanies may have inspired his decades of fine work but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably are dependent on oil which will run out that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it the reasons for watching it are two to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully and to observe scenes from the vast awesome daunting and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china br br because of the limitations of the narration the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed it even seems a misnomer new landscapes they are but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than manufactured 'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions
<START> i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one save for the lack of an internationally known top drawer cast this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn and you don't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers bravo to director herbert wise writers susan hill and nigel kneale top production design by jon bunker art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century i gave it a 9 out of 10 because with the production and budget constraints of television they really pulled of a great show
<START> this version of anna christie is in german greta garbo again plays anna christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version it's a good tale and a must see for garbo fans
<START> my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office space br br now i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times i love it it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films that's where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better it didn't we couldn't take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental i'd have been p ed if we'd actually paid for it we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it now since we didn't see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself i doubt it br br haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny it's painful just mail the friggin letters already the premise is asinine the jokes are awful we got as far as the printer doesn't work scene and had to stop we couldn't take it anymore this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth br br if you are a fan of office space don't waste your time with this turd 0 10
<START> how wonderful yet another movie about america by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times a day a piece and believes himself to be an expert on the country sheesh i should take a trip to germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about germany as the land of nazis or some such wim il boy you should get together with lars von trier and make the ultimate movie about the americans of course we all know it takes a pretentious left leaning we are the world european to make a real movie about america br br yeah right for a continent that started not one but two world wars europe sure has a lot of opinions about america's wrong foreign policy br br p s don't worry wim il boy there's plenty of uc berkeley americans that'll just love your movie of course these are the same people who thinks george w bush is worst than hitler and that a painting of a can of soup is sheer genius
<START> not as bad as it's credited to being hooper's done far worse Â more so disappointing for me such an imaginative concept which is never really tapped in to by hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky excuse the pun writing it goes so sinister and over the top in a dead serious tone becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery conspiracy laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt because of that the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and brad dourif cool to see him in a leading role seems to struggle with an off balanced performance despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off colour character even though it's cheaply done there's a competent technical attitude to it however it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts which some do work and strikingly steaming special effects flames flames everywhere instead hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery more so towards the latter end and the camera work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating the performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of william prince cynthia bain dey young jon cypher and melinda dillon also geroge buck flower and john landis have small but amusing cameosÂ especially landis nothing surprises but it's passably engaging
<START> this is an excellent movie as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar the winter canoeing trapping hunting and the like it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me br br the story of grey owl is well known to many canadians credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson for expanding the story br br brosnan does well portraying a complex man a very fine performance annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role the rest of the cast is solid
<START> urgh 3 things a movie needs a good script a good plot and good casting i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible i lost the will to live halfway through the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne who was the reason for me watching it in the first place she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13 it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast and i don't think she ever quite got the character br br i give the movie 2 out of 10 and thats only because of rose
