<START> this is amazing looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors when it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork br br the characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all over the top especially the villains the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing flatop pruneface lips mumbles etc br br meanwhile warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart and she's as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino dustin hoffman william forysthe paul sorvino mandy patinkin madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed br br the only negatives i found were pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile madonna's off key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun movie a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion like nothing you have ever seen
<START> a big surprise probably because i was expecting it to suck the reviews were pretty dismissive of it even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero and finds when he wants to break up with her that she's kind of a psycho i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did sure it doesn't make as much of its awesome premise as it could and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe but i can't blame it for that uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero g girl and i've discovered after several years of disliking him that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub he's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex it's one of the funniest sex scenes ever my only real complaint is that they make g girl a bit too much of a psycho like almost unbelievably so maybe with some background i could have accepted it better i can forgive its flaws though because i had a really good time watching it underrated for sure
<START> this was an excellent 2 part episode although i had never been seen the older ones i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal extra terrestial of course but not paranormal br br this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans in a futuristic time would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible br br being that it's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith especially if its also going to entertain american audiences but who care about what yanks say we rock doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 first being so harmless to scary from fun to serious from light to darkness i hope many old fans will one day soon say the old doctor who has returned br br 10 out of 10
<START> here are some examples of pat robertsons dubiously claimed relatively good track record on predictions br br in his widely reported comments from the january 2 edition of the christian broadcasting network's the 700 club during which he predicted that there would be very serious terrorist attacks and mass killing in the united states in the second half of 2007 host pat robertson boasted that he had a relatively good track record on earlier predictions but a review of robertson's 2006 new year's predictions undermines that claim he predicted for example that br br president bush is going to strengthen wrong br br the fall elections will be inconclusive but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge wrong br br the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion we'll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year way wrong br br further as a january 3 associated press article reported robertson has a history of making dubious predictions br br the broadcaster predicted in january 2004 that president bush would easily win re election bush won 51 of the vote that fall beating democratic sen john kerry of massachusetts wrong br br in 2005 robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term he said social security reform proposals would be approved wrong yet again br br he claims to speak directly with god if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again
<START> david lynch's 1999 film of john roach mary sweeney's story is set in iowa and wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release br br we come into the life of alvin straight richard farnsworth late on in life his medical condition is poor his life is mostly behind him and he knows it br br this makes what he decides to do even more remarkable and endearing he decides and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions to put a few things straight br br alvin is by this time in his life a man of great experience but modest means his daughter rose sissy spacek struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf but it's worth it because rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses br br this film is the story of a journey but like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense early on in the film we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey which no elderly gentleman of alvin's age should reasonably undertake br br but along the way we slowly learn how alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective his objective is very simple and straightforward his brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him he has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time br br along the way alvin meets many people the way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film we come to know who alvin straight is from what alvin straight does and at the end of the film we know who we are better
<START> this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town br br storyline br br essentially 20 years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film completed br br the storyline is flimsy one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek but it had no real oomph the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about it seems irrelevant it is weird hearing kylie's accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role but that doesn't redeem the film at all goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to 80s films bad horror films but really an aussie actor would have done just fine br br as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated some of these kids especially the two main chics they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act that is never a good look also the shots had a rough feel about them over lit perhaps just not as smooth as one is used to br br the killer lord could it be less frightening there are some shock factors though and a couple of gross scenes i did like the film but it was not great it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better they had a lot of characters get killed but no real build up to them getting slayed maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better br br now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny or so unbelieveable they were funny but i am not convinced br br lm
<START> being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the direct to video movies as i have mixed feelings of them as well br br while watching the lion king 1Â½ i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latter br br the lion king 1Â½ definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos br br i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i don't think many kids are really concerned about disney's profit margin on direct to video movies br br however i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie i'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me br br as for the music it wasn't too bad but don't expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of fun br br so all in all the lion king 1Â½ isn't a perfect movie but it's cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends' perspectives br br my imdb rating 7 10 my yahoo grade b good
<START> basically the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scotts ridley and tony let's make it straight the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner thriller ever made br br when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie one would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road it's a success that they created a super dark mexico city with a lot of shits happening one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire i don't know what would the mexicans think when they watch this br br well let's face it again it's among the best of the death wish genre but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence it's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the missing sheep type of tragic hero in the end they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that so that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony br br at the end i hope one would not take this movie for real br br 8 10 for art direction editing cinematographic denzel washington
<START> this film is about the life of queen victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of great britain br br the young victoria has amazing production every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail the extravagant costumes lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make the young victoria very impressive i was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography how every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out every scene is well composed the scene that strikes me the most was when victoria talks to melbourne melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from victoria's angle while from melbourne's angle victoria was situated between the space where melbourne held his arm on his hips br br story wise it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of queen victoria many events are rushed through or not even explained i expected a grand scene of the coronation and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds br br overall the young victoria is a good film and it would have been even better if it was longer so that events could be properly explained without rush
<START> oliver the musical is a favorite of mine the music the characters the story it all just seems perfect in this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical director carol reed brings the broadway hit to life on the movie screen br br the transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one you have to have the right voices the right set the right script and the right play all signs point to yes for this play it almost appears that it was written for the screen br br our story takes place in jolly old england where a boy named oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage he winds his way through the country to london where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents headed by dodger the smart talking quick handed pick pocket the leader of this gang is named fagin an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods br br but all is not well in london town when bill sykes played by oliver reed and his loving girlfriend nancy get tangled up with oliver fagin and his young troops and the law what ensues is a marvelous tale of love affection and great musical numbers br br whether or not you like musicals or not one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long oliver is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art
<START> i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i'm a big francophile and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw requiem for a dream i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film
<START> the story is being told fluidly there are no interruptions the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly casting was superb young ya'ara looked very much like ya'ara would have looked at that age her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story the cinematography is very good you feel like you are with ya'ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely it is interesting to note that even though out of sight is not a direct translation of lemarit ayin both names are very appropriate to the story
<START> there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately br br a friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise it's awesome br br i turned it on and couldn't stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist imagine if romeo as in shakepeare had a super power it is sad and poetic at the same time hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist granted it's not perfect but nothing ever is you know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story i don't want to see a remake it is too cool as is the hollywood system would as usual mess it up acting is top notch all around directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there kudos to all involved and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic a br br if you can find i watch it
<START> a far as b movies go scarecrow is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him apparently the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers this scarecrow aside from having a snappy one liner for each of his victims can also do matrix like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight also why did he always look like a rotted corpse just like the two needless sequels that followed this this isn't even worth a laugh
<START> this movie features an o k score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr hackenstein the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist horror comedy or low budget movies not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either this movie is simply here anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well if you are curious as i was and can actually find this you will realize the truth of the one line summary
<START> i've heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it a massive murdering of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually cause a cheerleading camp to close up fast forward to 1982 and bambi a former student opens it back up with new recruits among them candy carol kane glenn judge reinhold and sandy debralee scott one by one they are murdered by the killer until only one remains it is then when we find out who did it and why br br also in the movie are tom smothers doing a terrible accent as a canadian mountie and paul reubens doing his pee wee herman schtick the plot overall isn't very well developed and quite lame but some funny scenes do occur namely the house of bad pies and the strip poker scene the ending seems like it's thrown together which is a shame br br overall good for about ten or fifteen minutes total the rest you can just fast forward through maybe catch it on tv but it's not worth buying
<START> when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spells recopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 no i'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offended br br love yours truly dakota you can email me at dakota loves it hot mail com if you wanna
<START> poor performances by sinatra martin and hyer grossly underdeveloped supporting characters annoying talky with no real plot ending leaves you flatter than a pancake with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels that is if you even cared about these wooden characters maclaine is the only real asset that penultimate sequence in which the chicago hood searches for the sinatra character is laughable the music in that sequence also is poor and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a pig almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen
<START> dieter bohlen germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like you're my heart you're my soul felt the need to tell his story and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer the result was a funny book about his life well more or less a fuzzy image of it he didn't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself no word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital however it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the german version of american idol especially his unforgettable comments br br this should be the end of the story really in the hype of the mentioned idol tv show called deutschland sucht den superstar abbreviated dsds somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book the result is dieter der film br br i have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely none of the gags really hits the point naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although verona's voice should have done that more obvious childish predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes the content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on bohlen's sloppy idealized memory they could have used this freedom to do almost everything it was supposed to be a satire but they failed the story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all br br it's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release the probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of dsds turned out to be a mediocre success with the friendly help of germany's biggest yellow press newspaper bild and the desperate situation for the tv station rtl to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show wetten dass is running on channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television unfortunately br br watching this movie is a waste of time there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at br br therefore 2 10
<START> wonderful actors br br lousy script and not too great direction either my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people not the killer not the victims the settings were pretty drab dennis quaid's character was so poorly written in i didn't even care when the end came he got his kid back big deal i wanted my money back
