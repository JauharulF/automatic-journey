<START> as a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such i have to say i loved this movie it is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one i'll be watching for the next one i gave it a 10
<START> the power to dream is a wonderful thing there's a saying not all dreamers achieve but all achievers dream by exploring our imagination we shape our own futures or build empires perhaps overcome our fears limitations and obstacles gain wisdom and benefit mankind or put simply just find our way to true love and happiness freud might express such things in symbols the language of fantasy br br tristan ventures out of a rather twee english village called wall he goes through a break in the wall a portal in search of something that will prove his love to victoria sienna miller victoria doesn't take him very seriously so he pledges to bring back a falling star br br stormhold is the world outside the wall he discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl yvaine claire danes to complicate matters three evil witches want to get hold of yvaine if they can eat her heart it will replenish their youth one of the witches is played by michelle pfeiffer who does fabulous young old transformations of looks and manner the 'good guy' they meet on their way is captain shakespeare robert de niro he has a fierce swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath heirs of stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the kingdom ricky gervais is an added extras a buffoon trader throwing in standard gervais type gags well tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of yvaine so there is a nice little triangle going till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women br br stardust is a full on large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars wholly positive and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of harry potter romps production values rival hollywood and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping misogyny religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies br br that is not to say that stardust is without its faults plot and dialogue have many predictable elements and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences but if you want an excuse to let your heart fly this film may well provide it br br as a boy i remember listening in wonder to albums by the moody blues who practiced in a house not far from where i lived they made records with names like in search of the lost chord and wrote lyrics like thinking is the best way to travel i would fill my head with books on magic and mystery from timothy leary to aleister crowley shaping dreams learning to make them real nowadays people might talk of nlp or positive thinking adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity do you still enjoy that feeling br br you are advised not to wait for stardust on dvd see it on the biggest cinema screen you can find and dolby digital surround sound if you can get it the actors look like they had a ball maybe you will too
<START> delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time not just from france but from everywhere br br my favorite segments br br 14th arrondissement carol margo martindale from denver comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her life br br montmartre there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic paris br br loin du 16Ã¨me an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the citÃ©s ana catalina sandino moreno spends more time taking care of somebody else's kid she's a nanny than of her own br br quartier latin so much fun to see gÃ©rard depardieu as the tenancier de bar with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorce br br tour eiffel don't tell me you didn't like those mimes br br tuileries such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist who's making high contact a no no with a girl in the metro br br parc monceau nick nolte is great ludivine sagnier also br br i've spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back br br seen in barcelona another great city at the verdi on march 18th 2007 br br 84 100
<START> karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island they capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island whom after a while fight back well the survivors this one has non stop blood gore and carnage which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money i may be overexxagerating there it was probably just a couple days worth the horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and i suspect if i had been really drunk some of it might have been slightly humorous maybe but as it is at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by oh i don't know 78 minutes don't waste your time br br my grade f br br dvd extras bonus movie zombie '90 extreme pestilence and trailers for other shock o rama released films
<START> this movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending it's still well worth seeing the film begins as claudette colbert is about to marry robert ryan when the minister asks if anyone has any objections a guy jumps up and announces that colbert can't get married because she already is married colbert insists this isn't true but when they investigate they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license slowly it becomes apparent that claudette's mind is slipping and people around her seriously doubt her sanity then when the supposed first husband is murdered all evidence and suspicion falls on colbert br br the film is an exciting mystery suspense film as what i have so far described is only the first half of the movie what follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating unfortunately the conclusion though is a bit of a let down as the guiding force behind all this turns out to come right out of left field and is baffling since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer however in spite of this the film was so good i can even excuse the limp ending in particular robert ryan did a great job as the knuckle busting fiancÃ© though apart from him the other performances were also excellent
<START> i thought the kids in the movie were great i deal with kids in that age group and i thought their behaviors were very believable i did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5 year old i didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie br br i think luke benward is up and coming star i would like to see more of him on the big screen i enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie br br i also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group it is a major problem in schools today br br the ending was quite unexpected billy's thoughts on whether he won or didn't win the bet were very surprising how he handled that situation was excellent too often today kids are not willing to compromise the actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life
<START> when samantha eggar as phyllis dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck and it is not entirely eggar's fault in the original film wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house and she doesn't come out she appears almost as if by magic walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than neff fred macmurray when they are first introduced it is not just the towel the towel adds to the seductive allure her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation she has sexual even magic power this person is no ordinary housewife this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within br br back to 1973 the remake has crenna knock on the front door stanwyck's stand in eggar answers the door with a towel around her there is no appearance she simply opens the door the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 she opens the door with a towel around her it may be sexy in a charlie's angels sort of way but it's not nearly as mysterious the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilder's point the script may have said phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel the point is not the towel the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis and the potential power she wields wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that's what wilder did and in the choice of shot lost all of phyllis' mystique br br richard crenna also seems miscast he seems like he's acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70's actor he can't get into the 1940's when macmurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face no sweat on crenna and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning in the original neff says i didn't get the money and i didn't get the woman in the 1973 version crenna says i didn't get the money and i didn't want the woman did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story or were they dumbing it down for a television audience br br this made for tv movie is a by the numbers rendition all the sharp edge of the original is lost the only stand out maybe is lee j cobb in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tv movie made probably by the same people who did gilligan's island they might as well have tried to remake citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocrity is the best one can hope for what's the point the 1944 classic is a film with a capital f this made for tv remake deserves an f grade or maybe a d for dumb
<START> this show seemed to be kinda good kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong br br first of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way as stated above i hate it br br all in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed
<START> the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens br br it is my belief that this film would be the 1 worst film on imdb if anyone had actually watched it the plot is disconnected and in several way too many instances makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous but still somewhat better film br br i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh
<START> jamie foxx is my favorite comedian however i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker martin lawrence and dave chapple who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept see money talks blue streak br br okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream or in living color's tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire bamboozled
<START> this video nasty was initially banned in britain and allowed in last november without cuts br br it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 ursula buchfellner the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures i am not sure what the purpose of that was it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene br br laura buchfellner is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom peter al cliver the beyond zombie is sent to find her and the ransom of course one of the kidnappers antonio de cabo manages to pass the time productively while another werner pochath whines incessantly br br the ransom exchange goes to hell and laura runs into the jungle will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal oh yes there are cannibals in this jungle why do you think it was a video nasty muriel montossÃ© is found by peter and his partner antonio mayans angel of death on the kidnapper's boat montossÃ© is very comfortably undressed peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura who has been captured by now they pass the time having sex and don't see the danger approaching guts anyone great fight between peter and the naked devil burt altman br br blood decapitation guts lots of full frontal some great writhing by the cannibal priestess aline mess and the line they tore her heart out which is hilarious if you see the film
<START> in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine whoopi zonked out tranquilizers whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right that's how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time post coital teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to get moving only when ex go gos' charlotte caffey's the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up and then it's over br br this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer's day in the deep american south
<START> however i am not one of them caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and self centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self indulgent mess moretti says he feels a need to make this movie but doesn't want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesn't want to either a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating but this is not that film at one point moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them interposed with moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument but they never come i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity
<START> now i haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here so i'm not going to go down that path here br br but i have some time ago learnt that stephen king movies simply are not horror films with perhaps a couple of exceptions this was not one of them it started well enough and for once i'm not going to complain about the acting although fred gwynne was as usual wonderful also i will forgive the total lack of parenting skills as they were necessary to make the story here move forward br br but there was one consistent point that i couldn't help but get annoyed with and that came pretty close to the end of the movie and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity the moments i refer to are thus there is a tiny zombie running around the house you suspect it is under the bed do you br br a get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you or br br b move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety or at least see the mini terror coming at you giving you a little reaction time br br i know let's go with a i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today bleh br br fun enough film though just not very scary
<START> the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction two brothers andy and hank will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most br br andy hanson philip seymour hoffman and his younger brother hank ethan hawke couldn't be more different andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina marisa tomei who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed hank however is divorcÃ©e who finds himself at the mercy of his ex wife his daughter's expensive school bills and endless amount of child support payments a man who means well and has good intentions hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it br br however andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears the pressure of his life and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again of course like hank he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it how by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers their families and several other lives will be destroyed because of greed pride and fear br br the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told after the robbery goes wrong and nanette hanson rosemary harris who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles albert finney to the death of his wife the relationship between charles and his two sons especially to andy is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story br br philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also in contradictory way as a man we can sympathize with ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions br br before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face more than that our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected in what should have been best picture of the year we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives in other words there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse br br 10 10
<START> oh man it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science well i guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics al gore tries to make this issue sound complicated even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda br br how have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet by estimating the sun spot activity has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate no not even gore himself so how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past according to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be how come the temperature in the entire universe has risen relatively equal much as on earth does our suvs cause temperature on jupiter to rise br br use some common sense you do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a hoax please research it yourself what does al gore and his elitist friends like rothschild banking family that arranged live earth event to gain from this well the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits that is tax on everything that gives co2 omissions and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers al gore has even a company that sells carbon credits is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world especially if it goes into his own company br br i do not want you to blindly believe me please do your own research and use your own common sense and i am sure you will come to the right conclusion
<START> i watch lots of bad films lots it's kind of a hobby really almost every saturday nite a group of friends and i get together and watch trash from around the globe anything turkish super hero movies vampire flicks from brazil italian gorilla transplant movies kevin costner films anything except maybe raising helen but ihave never seen a worst film than theodore rex never and it's not even entertainingly bad in an ed wood kinda way it just sucks now this film was famous in hollywood at the time it was made because whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of crap she tried to get out of her contract she whined she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see yikes and you can just see her seething during takes doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him the dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible a third grade class could do a better job if promised cookies
<START> this is a good adaptation of austen's novel good but not brilliant br br the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to gimmickry but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialogue driven br br the acting is competent ms paltrow is aloof as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making endeavours some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level
<START> inspector gadget was probably my all time favorite 80's cartoon i enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's christmas special inspector gadget saves christmas some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season 1985 of the show but they need to compare it to dic's 2002 release of inspector gadget's last case claw's revenge for then they will find the second season to be absolute gold br br being a gadget fan i couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated inspector gadget in something that wasn't gadget boy related i purchased the film and i swore to myself that i'd be objective i knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series i was not even prepared for what i was about to watch br br there was barely a shred of the original show still intact br br here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie the humor is non existent from the original series br br penny and brain originally having a nearly equal part in the series as gadget are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals br br the original music by saban levy is not there and the score that exists is sub par understood that saban has his own production company now but at least inspector gadget saves christmas had good music even without saban don't expect to see any of gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing such as gadget copter gadget brella gadget mallet gadget coat which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets in this movie his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs that kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show and simply aren't necessary to change br br the gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast talking supposedly hip convertible all the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa br br chief quimby is now very short tempered and even mean to gadget he was always grumpy in the original series but this pushes the situation a bit much br br penny no longer has a computer book br br are there any positives to this movie ok here goes br br maurice lamarche does a good job of taking over for the great don adams as inspector gadget br br in one scene chief quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series the great wambini classic gadget villain from the second season voiced by louis nye br br looking for more redeeming factors for this movie well you're out of luck life is about making choices and living by those choices most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson the lesson learned here keep to the original formula if it ain't broke don't fix it true gadget fans should steer clear from this movie you will surely be disappointed br br hopefully dic and shout factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of inspector gadget the original series volume 1 containing the first 22 episodes of the series as a true gadget fan lover of 80's animation and many of dic's programs i urge you the viewer to purchase inspector gadget the original series volume 1 and inspector gadget saves christmas dvd's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories
<START> i just didn't get this movie was it a musical no but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it br br was it a serious drama no the acting was not good enough for that br br is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor definently not br br i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse br br see for yourself but in fairness i hated it
