<START> the only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again even for a tv movie it is flat the cast is boring the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand how two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise and it is shot in slo mo and cut short at the anticipated pay off if you are tempted to see this pop it in set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy with any luck you'll doze off quickly and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over namely this movie
<START> in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer the plot is thin to say the least the cantonese dialog is not funny see this movie at your peril br br david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom coms out there and just blends into the scenery it was like watching paint dry br br in short this movie was a total waste of time and space i've seen better movies on youtube
<START> despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and john lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is one note and irritating br br the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained
<START> i did not have too much interest in watching the flock andrew lau co directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels mueller i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study so they fired him and hired another director this usually does not work well let's remember the invasion but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected it's not a great film but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well also the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances now let's go to the negative points one element which really bothered me there was a moment in which it irritated me was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more attitude and style that tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary plus i think the film should have been more ambitious in spite of that i recommend the flock as a good thriller it's not memorable at all but it's entertaining
<START> i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the ft lauderdale film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a comment review on this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs excellent acting and an inspiring message ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life this is poignantly illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in various shapes and sizes enter into a pool of water this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes which hold your attention and imagination
<START> to die for has it all this film has a great cast lots and lots of romance and terror not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans there are a lot more vampire love stories if you are a fan of vampire love stories i strongly recommend this film 10 10
<START> at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don't waste your time or money
<START> this movie is a joke i mean a ha ha funny joke why because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting wow br br within this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how why are there four black women who are zombie's caretakers and what is their purpose since when does 6 people make up a nation of zombies and is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone anywhere even a 2 year old br br and lastly why was this movie made at all why why why no answer that's what i thought br br on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance lol at least they had the decency to do this much
<START> ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way through br br this film is mild inoffensive and lacklustre the story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles a tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'god' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised it uses the irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'oirish' accent all in all why do they pump these out
<START> this movie doesn't have an awful lot to do with it's predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot jox 2 robot wars br br robot jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn't very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch br br just like robot jox this is a b movie but with as a big difference that it's just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot jox got made during the '80's when b movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in 1990 this really can't be said about this movie it's just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking 'this is it that's all ' br br what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot line really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main characters br br seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he's god's gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone weren't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie br br for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle droids in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable br br you can better watch a mighty morphin' power rangers episode for some more action and likability br br 3 10
<START> redundant but again the case if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics in this case schneider then you should go basic comedyÂ man's life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him unfortunately he takes on each animal's characteristics former survivor colleen looks pretty good here now that she doesn't have open sores on her legs and a little makeup on her face d
<START> farrah fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker this movie not only makes you examine your own morals it proves that fawcett can excel as a serious actress both as a victim and victor
<START> brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore fests but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all the re animator sequels aren't as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series and society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging i'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear it's running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry doesn't frighten me but surprisingly i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner and his life isn't the only one as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger br br when it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not squeamish about going to the dentist yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level and while this won't be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while b class is actually quite impressive with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast doesn't massively impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i don't hesitate to recommend this film
<START> let me state first that i love westerns civil war stories i also consider john ford as an excellent director i also have the same high feelings for john wayne william holden's acting ability br br i cannot remember if i saw this film when it first came out in 1959 last night was the first time i saw it since then br br as per my 4 rating one can say i did not like the movie br br i now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings br br john lee mahin who wrote the screenplay from harold sinclair's novel was a very gifted writer wrote many fine scripts this script is poorly written badly researched they make mention of the awful conditions of the andersonville prison at the time of the movie andersonville was not in operation they also use rifles that were not used at the time br br john ford was directing films for over 40 years won 4 oscars he must have been ill during the making of this his usual style was missing it could be that this was film in the south east and not in monument valley br br he normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film most were missing this time this time only minor cowboy stars hoot gibson ken curtiss have roles of course anna lee has a small role there were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars see below mr fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were sadly missed here br br now we come to the main stars john wayne william holden the duke also must have been ill he seemed out of place here this sort of role usually fit his style perfectly he was just adequate here wiliam holden did the best he could but nowhere as good as he usually was br br it was required that there be an actress in this type of movie here in her first major role second film is constance towers a very beautiful person but not really an actress she is still having roles on television let me be kind and say she has had a long career more based on her looks than acting talent also in caas as ms towers servant is tennis star althea gibson i am glad she stuck to tennis br br the rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other john ford films there were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry not good at all the action scenes were good but come at the end of film br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 47 points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this one and although the ending made me angry i still give it 10 out of 10 br br four college girls baltron kelly stahl and cadby are driving down to florida on their way they meet 2 guys turner davis they really add nothing to the plot but are at least somewhat likable the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun but they have car problems and never make it one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help the other three stay by the car br br soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes soon she witnesses as a man march strangles a woman in terror the girl flees the area she doesn't get very far but manages to get lost br br her friends by the car go looking for her they too go into the woods and run into the same man one of them sees the dead woman the man responds by shooting the girls head off the other girl runs away manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed br br eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested this is when i started getting mad these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them br br they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell the remaining friend manages to escape but not without getting in dangerous situations br br this movie has nudity good actresses a shower scene imitating psycho graphic violence towards women and solid story some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending but over all this is a great little unknown movie
<START> we as a family were so delighted with 'the last of the blonde bombshells' we purchased a copy for our home video library br br the acting is a1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the music songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the 'plot' as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds br br full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music
<START> i really enjoyed doctor mordrid this is a low budget film which may be off putting to some but i have no problem with it i admire it even more for that considering it's way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year too bad this didn't get a theatrical release i don't know about anyone else but i would have went to see it in theatres doctor mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if they're into sci fi like i am i don't see why this is a r rated film only one f word is said and there are no gruesome death scenes nor is there any blood at all the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race while kabal wanted to enslave them gave the story a sense of enchantment while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself basically this a film that's just plain fun to watch there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie though seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit that makes me laugh every time i see it but i digress anyway the acting is great the main protagonists anton and his lady friend samantha are very likable anton is sympathetic and hospitable and samantha is friendly plus the settings were wonderful the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting we're only given a glimpse of it twice though it would have been great to see more scenes take place here the main setting was also very neat anton's apartment is very roomy and he has some cool devices especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar overall this a great film it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles if you can find anywhere that rents doctor mordrid' you should rent it or in my case buy it it was definitely money well spent br br my rating 8 stars out of ten br br
<START> of the spate of austen films from the 1990s this is my favorite more even than persuasion which was the one that converted me to austeniana before seeing this emma i had seen two previous versions but in one emma seemed all wrong more like lady teazle and in the other she seemed half wrong like a possible impostor whereas here she seemed just right young and silly and stubborn in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well indeed it is one of the sweetest merriest things i have ever seen rather in the nature of a christmas treat the script is unusually well formed and the adapter's additions like the shaft of light that reveals harriet to emma in church are all in keeping mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected but i enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain spoken practical side of the character in contrast with emma's affectations and his choleric outbursts against frank churchill are quite funny bernard hepton makes mr woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity samantha morton as emma's protÃ©gÃ© is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be and as in the same producers' pride and prejudice care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed uniquely in some cases for me this production was and remains a delight
<START> it's all up to you ed now you get to play the game the day my father left my mother he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood i was but fourteen years old i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing but i will never forgot it especially the scene with ned beatty br br watching it today thirty six years later it still gives me quivers br br my father was a huge burt reynolds fan hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie ' i had seen two films at the dome prior to this grand prix and the song of norway well this wasn't exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch after leaving the theater i was shell shocked br br but even at that tender age i appreciated the artistry and after seeing again today am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing yet extremely well crafted film br br suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend i don't blame my father for taking me but it was a bit much for a child to witness br br as an adult i still find it quite disturbing yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film making br br burt reynolds as an absolute wonder as are all the principles from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman everyone does an admirable job the sound quality is second to none from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks the photography cinematography all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate br br the moral questions raised from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life altering these four men city men suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined raise the bar from action to horror br br it's a classic to be sure and the phrase you have a pretty mouth has been quoted endlessly from saturday night live to off the cuff comments around water cooler at work this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture as much as make my day or i'll be back ever were br br so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city cozy bed wife and kids and if you took the measures burt reynolds did and i would have done the same would you bury the body beneath the soon to be lake or stand trial and take your chances the bottom line is deliverance delivers you can take that to the bank if this movie doesn't get under your skin then you are not human br br even if you have seen this before rent it again and ask yourself the above question br br my favorite part of the film remains the same ed failing to kill the deer then changing life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight in particular as ed gives the best performance here and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d roosevelt in pearl harbor his acting lifts the movie to another level climbing the rocks at dusk terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level br br briskly paced tense taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today times have changes but our choices as human beings have not br br ten out of ten stars
<START> and anyone who watches this film will agree this film was directed in the days when plot character believability and theme actually mattered br br jean peters widmark and thelma ritter steal the spotlight ritter is in top form as informer moe she survives in the bowery section of ny acting as a stool pigeon for nyc police br br the only other film in which i have seen peters is niagara and she certainly proves her acting ability here complete with brooklyn accent widmark is appropriately menacing as the anti hero who must discern what the right thing is despite his need for cash br br the photography is brilliant the neon the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient excellent use is made of the city with lightning louie in chinatown the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop 10 10
