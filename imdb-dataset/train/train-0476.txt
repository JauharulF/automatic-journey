<START> the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything i actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept br br i hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are which date we are at and especially what the characters feel and think i believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience br br but after the bad influencing intro a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time the lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations for example a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well i think the director is a very good observer about real life br br but that is it after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story telling i really felt like i'm having a big headache because of the non stop talking characters it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs it is realistic really but characters always asking really is that so etc to each other or characters saying no or are you listening to me ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache br br i also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes
<START> not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of j edgar's hoover's constant attention to maintaining a good pr profile they don't make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of jimmy stewart and vera miles in the blend too bad br br
<START> this and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera was the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year 1939 i will not not restate the obvious cary grant victor mclaglen who was a bengal lancer and douglas fairbanks jr give superb comic performances however i want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece the magnificent final battle sequence as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment is simply grand it never fails to enthrall me yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli's performance as the guru this is no fu manchu caricature but an well drawn articulate historically informed have you ever heard of changruputra maurya he defeated the armies left in india by alexander the great villain indeed one can see parallels between this mystical evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties a german not an indian gunga din anti nazi tract not quite but still a tremendous funny moving epic
<START> i'm a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn flic soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen
<START> three story lines and not enough tying them together inside man was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic though having its moments the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl jumped quickly between highs and lows and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes i will give credit to denzel washington he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical super detective with all the answers clive owen also did quite well with his duality part as evil genius and criminal mastermind both not the same in retrospect overall though each person individually created a great sub section yet when the parts finally came together and everything counted there was no sudden ah ha or summation of everything it all ended up with very little of the energy it began with with a lot of plot holes tons of questions and as i said earlier no where near spike lee's normal level i have to completely disagree with the so called professional critics this is not the movie they play it up to be
<START> i basically picked up this movie because i had seen kitano takashi's brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred asano tadanobu these two movies are worlds apart zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichÃ©s gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction br br first off i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in benkei's presence yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself instead of character development we get bloated boring gory battle scenes asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of asano's appeal but this movie doesn't serve him br br a lot of the camera movement is nauseating there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and i felt like vomiting the ending is ridiculous and rather anti climatic br br its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget the colors scenery and costumes were great but the rest is just a loooong waste of time i would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth
<START> this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey dovey romance don't waste your time and money br br on the other hand if you're into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood it's truly fantastic i really mean that br br ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruder br br in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the movie br br the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power br br bottom line the movie's flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding
<START> i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of one woman's struggle against all odds is an old clichÃ© by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple br br it also showed a different side to the african american experience showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portray white on black violence and win an oscar trend br br also the acting performances are superb especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for br br well worth watching but keep some tissue handy
<START> my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos battle for space shown on russia's first channel on april 10 13 2006 bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it's the case the number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first missiles even the u s half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions the audience is not told of any v 2 a 4 launches from the u s three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number 'ue' onboard apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon etc in the russian half each and every person is ludicrous korolev is scared of nkvd glushko is saboteur and traitor mishin is alcoholic etc men as functions no motivation no life at all uniform and decorations are awful gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch i think this was added specially for russian version
<START> fabulous fantastic probably disney's best musical adventure i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative clever and fun even despite the silly flying bed scenes the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins br br david tomlinson though he had few quality movie roles absolutely shines in this adventure he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays blustering prim and proper englishman nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice br br the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can br br bobbing along bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers all of them are fantastic and worth remembering portobello road being one of my favorites br br a great film that still holds up today
<START> i would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again the prince of annoying myles berkowitz has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo cool the only amusing thing in this whole mess is mr samaha's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust it is choppy and badly done in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny it is neither i seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film or tape but this one qualifies for that distinction if a date suggests seeing this film run
<START> having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising alive did not deliver very slow development loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up could have done so much more at the end most of the movie is just sitting around to put it plainly three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end it really needed more shock elements if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some and loads of disappointment
<START> i am going to go out on a limb and actually defend shades of grey as a good clip show episode which delved into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease br br the scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as 11001001 angel one and up the long ladder tragic moments were highlighted such as tasha's death in skin of evil as well as elements of pulse pounding danger in heart of glory conspiracy and the aforementioned skin of evil riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as an ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once after 3 days of intense pain the snake died this episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of will riker under extreme duress and yes i am biased in my opinion in proclaiming shades of grey as a solid episode because at the time of its original airing my face was covered in sweat wondering whether or not riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great galactic outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier br br of course in subsequent years i seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode but if an award should go for the best clip show episode in the history of television then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect
<START> hmm hip hop music to a period western modern phrases like cool and too many others to keep track of the sistahs are in tha house french manicured nails on hard riding girls microphone packs clearly visible on li'l kim's back i just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors br br the acting isn't as bad as i've ever seen the women did well enough with a poor script br br it was weird hearing louis mandylor speaking in his native accent br br the girls are beautiful the costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect i just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story i would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city br br
<START> this movie starts slow then tapers off after watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen i walked out i mean nothing happened zero zip nada there is no story the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture there is no motion i could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions the script is a joke it's just awful i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minutes of my life watching love in the time of money but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader i could have been the first to walk out but i waited a bit too long instead i watched about 20 people walk out before me
<START> it's interesting how 90 of the high vote reviews are all comprised of random username from united states no state pride who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies i would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselves br br let me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan this means i have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can wholeheartedly claim that facing the giants is in fact not a good movie it has good intentions but fails to meet many if any basic standards that i associate with a quality filmgoing experience br br the acting mostly terrible palatable at best hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me br br the dialogue clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you'd see performed in sunday school or youth group function the rave review robots revel in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is palpable let's just say the mean ol' head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than oh no when things are not going his way br br the plot mind bogglingly predictable it has been commented that this movie is not a hollywood clichÃ© and yet it's like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for dummies including the mandatory quasi romantic subplot for the ladies and just had a christian themed coat of paint slapped on it i'm not lying or bragging when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here br br the directing editing it too was patterned almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie template still acting aside there weren't many noticeable goofs so at least facing the giants was technically competent br br the message ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team's eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole if we lose we praise you part because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and it's good to be prepared for that but in the world of facing the giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating another interesting question being what if the eagles came across another team that had gotten religion would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last minute saves or would the universe simply have exploded br br the bottom line for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd lamenting the evils of hollywood facing the giants will be another mediocre at best christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film making for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else and a warning any attempt to show this to non christians will lead not to conversion but to derision i give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget
<START> this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which brian flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest his claims concerning the invalidity of paul's testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts like the existence of some formulated creeds within paul's letters these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ's death and resurrection the testimonies of the early christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period but only one of them has remained jesus why because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected even if the gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier br br what i am saying is that flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti christian view don't be fooled by poor investigation
<START> i like chris rock but i feel he is wasted in this film the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely when eddie murphy remade dr doolittle and the nutty professor he re did them totally so they became murphy films vehicles not just tepid remakes that's why they were successful if chris had done the same this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly so why does hollywood keep making junk like this because people go to see it because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place
<START> what we have here is a classic case of too much patriotism this is what happens when you live in a small country with very little next to none even cinema history whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project Â other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians Â everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries' borders this is especially the case when the writer director of this particular film is already a nation's sweetheart because he's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band any way the wind blows is by no means a bad film but it's definitely overrated if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer this is basically the flemish version of classic movies such as short cuts and magnolia and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end the only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of antwerp where they all live and work but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party the main problem with any way the wind blows at least according to yours truly lies with the characters they really are random uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary it was presumably writer director tom barman's intention to depict the average regular inhabitant of antwerp but then seriously what is the point one of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis two siblings recently lost their father and the most mysterious one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes there are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen but they're even less worth mentioning these people simply drivel on and on about very random topics like life in the 80's dates and each other's bowel motions and philosophy about matters nobody cares about some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles especially the interactions between the two twenty something guys from ghent but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable the film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of antwerp and as an extended versatile music documentary there are several stylish nifty sightseeing images of antwerp and there's always beautiful music playing whether really loud or subtly in the background generally speaking any way the wind blows is a competently made and stylish effort but too mundane and slightly boring and i honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren't a flemish production
<START> dream quest was a surprisingly good movie there were some noticeable goofs but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining it gets kind of silly at times but overall i recommend it they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good
