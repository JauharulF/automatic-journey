<START> i considered myself to be quite melancholy especially when i watch a great touching and tear jerking movies but not for this one which surprised me and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly br br there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies 1 despite guilt ridden ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly in the end this was a disturbing action to me br br 2 the movie story line is over dramatized but the logic is over simplified medically blood type match is required to be an organ donor toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period nevertheless it seemed that ben had the rare blood type same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently despite the rarity of ben's blood type he was able to donate not only his heart but also his kidney his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen br br 3 why the doctors allow ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself br br i might be over analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie however some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie if you go for a soap opera type of film go for it but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment give this one a miss
<START> this is a perfect series for family viewing we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america it is an up to date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike our teenager and tween ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robin's next exploits we can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free on demand viewing br br the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion there is a moral to each story it is entertaining the violence is not over the top or needless the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william's feel to it it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair br br there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting reality tv to senseless violence you should take this for what it is and that is an updated robin hood not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn this is a gem to be enjoyed by all parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls rather than stand by and do nothing she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the night watchman the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad guy br br the only question we have is where is friar tuck
<START> i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time an english major at that at the time i saw this film i was a high school student i want to say junior year but it may have been senior hard to remember my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like i'm not a phd by any means br br that said br br this movie is simply terrible it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science and they are numerous and she dismissed my claims because oh so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds in this case apparently so br br leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or in fact intelligent leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film leaving that behind the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when in fact he completely opposed them br br i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so br br http www intuitor com moviephysics bleep html
<START> it is written in stone that disney animations simply must be musicals right where show me because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for not containing the hokey made for five year old standard disney musical fare br br while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been it was still quite good enjoyable and adventurous i had hoped for a bit more yes considering the subject matter but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be br br the animation quality is average but the dialog is quite compelling as is the story line plot sub plot and amazing creativity i found within this production i will refrain from outlining the plot as it has been done and done but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy br br this is in my opinion the best disney animated feature length film br br it rates a 9 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement the acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible i would never recommend this movie to anyone i've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie i did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly but they have left out too many key components of the book the movie tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy while putting myself in the position who had not read the book i saw the celestine prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy b s i am thoroughly disappointed with redfield for the way this movie turned out
<START> the concept of this made for tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970's and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of the omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups seriously i'm not kidding that's what the movie is about during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself you'd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little damien in the omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky Â that's the dog's name Â is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because he's a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life director curtis harrington what's the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satan dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but it's definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor there are entertaining brief cameos of martine beswick dr jekyll and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and r g armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice cream in carpenter's assault on precinct 13
<START> first of all there wasn't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really it wasn't a bad movie just another movie where i said well that wasn't anything special after i'd seen it there was probably drama and stuff but it simply didn't grab me but more seamed semi dull as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way the quality of the film itself the images seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv movie than a well respected english film maker the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion didn't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes i haven't seen many english films and the ones i've seen didn't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work colors and such game tried to be more cool hip smart see my review of lola rennt about this if you wish but didn't succeed for me either overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't anything special at best i'm afraid and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted
<START> the title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but i would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of real candidates plan 9 from outer space battlefield earth and the adventures of pluto nash br br as i watched the 90 minute bore i found it difficult to even stay awake even while i was trying so hard to laugh at the film but alas i felt alone in the dark i was gonna try to avoid the pun but i couldn't resist as i looked around hoping to see mike nelson and his two robot friends alas my friends and i had to provide comedy throughout the film br br so about the film itself lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film the film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the xenos in aliens they even call them xenos and the creatures in pitch black the can turn invisible at random and i assure you it is random and get hurt by light also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie all of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997 the action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow people shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background br br and those were the high points the story revolving around a paranormal investigator slater whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater tshirt with a trench coat and not shaving for 2 days an archaeologist reid who is rather inept and a government agent dorff whose lines involve barking order all three should be ashamed at their performances not that they have really ever done a good a job before and the casting director should be ashamed reid and slater are supposed to be lovers in the film i guess the film contains the single most awkward love scene i have ever seen on film between the two br br then comes the plot quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all the rest is illogical at best the plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars the film begins with text and a voice explaining the back story this opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible this opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film and the ending did not make one ounce of sense not only did it not make sense in the world of the film it simply did not make sense br br finally the direction of one uwe boll disgrace thats all that can be said his use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense his lack of direction with the actors just watch reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot the complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects and finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers br br i payed a 1 50 to see this show at a second run theater and while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter i would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one br br shame on you uwe boll shame on you tara reid shame on you christian slater shame on you stephen dorff shame on anyone who was associated with this film
<START> i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle let's face it she looks good she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such it never claims to be either it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate it's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen br br the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure the score is amazing as well br br sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from david morrissey who's virtually unknown br br there's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for br br at the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it and that's the movie's only intentions so if you've got beef with mizz stone maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit
<START> i am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one or vice versa being that it is nearly fifteen years since i saw this film the fact that i remember so little about it does not bode well perhaps it is simply because i only watched it once or twice but i doubt it if there was anything worth remembering about this film you can rest assured i would remember it br br at the time this film was released the franchise was still entering its dying phase so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it it's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics one such article had to explain that freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans so he decides to go after alice's unborn son so far so good but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience it should not be left to some unrelated publication br br making use of the trivia given in part three about freddy's conception one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the horror for infants category but alas that was not to be it goes to show the sheer idiocy of the american ratings system that a piece of b'harni esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original br br by this time the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it lisa wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast either way given that her last role was in something called the all new adventures of chastity blade i doubt she really had anything else going for her even poor old robert englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years br br given that box office returns were in a steady decline and not just for this franchise at the time one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable in fact this particular film like its immediate predecessor was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise despite this part five must be given some credit for not having the bright luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at br br i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten by trying to appeal to everyone or the mpaa's idea of everyone it succeeds in appealing to noone like parts two and four one could erase it from the continuity entirely and nobody would notice the difference
<START> there are a number of problems with this movie but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little the base story is quite good but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice the non existent budget really killed this movie stuart gordon the writer director has writing credit on 'honey i shrunk the kids' which was a box office smash however that movie had some serious cash backing from disney honestly this is a good example of when to not make a movie had he waited a few more years technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects not to mention he could have found a company with money
<START> a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well it's about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people he's killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it but there's a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens next br br the plot is old hat but this isn't bad for what it is a low budget slasher film it's well made with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress br br no great shakes but not bad at all i give it a 7
<START> i have no idea as to which audience director george schlatter hoped to sell this comedy of ills with redd foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s norman plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings not to mention an elongated cameo by waylon flowers based on a play by sam bobrick and ron clark this tale of an estranged married couple foxx and pearl bailey learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay and living with a mincing prancing white homosexual has enough limp wristed jokes to shame any early episode of three's company bailey keeps her dignity and foxx's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles but the rest of the performers are humiliated from
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have seen i watched it on dvd and the disc does not have any special features or even a menu but that is not necessarily what i care about br br i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis depending on among other things if it is a big studio production or a smaller film this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things that said i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen br br i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin alan arkin has most of the funniest lines the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor br br this is not a movie for children obviously but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity there is quite a bit of adult language though but it can sometimes be very funny in particular alan arkin's character who can't even swear correctly br br also watch for the cameos from known character actors
<START> was'nt really bad for raw's first ppv of 006 but the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance the ones who were watching at home br br first match ric flair vs edge w lita for the wwe intercontinental championship not a bad opener these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match flair wins by dq after edge slams him with his mitb briefcase 3 10 second match trish stratus vs mickie james for the wwe women's championship not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these divas faced off in the ring together mickie goes for a modified chick kick but trish ducks nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title 3 10 third match triple h vs big show seriously good this match was really the whole match hhh focuses on big show's injured arm but big show still fights back later hhh is able to topple down big show nails a pedigree for the win 5 10 fourth match shelton benjamin w mama vs viscera this was a bonus match not that bad it was alright after viscera was down behind the referee benjamin's mama got a purse which had bricks in it slammed viscera on the head with it three times viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by benjamin for the win against the big man 4 10 br br fifth match jerry 'the king' lawler vs gregory helms boring slow sloppy both men didn't really put a very good effort jerry lawler wins after a fist drop for the win 2 10 br br sixth match torrie wilson vs victoria vs ashley vs maria vs candice michelle in a first ever women's gauntlet match it was pretty entertaining to me ashley i think eliminates candice last to win the first ever women's gauntlet match 5 10 seventh match john cena vs chris masters vs carlito vs shawn michaels vs kane vs kurt angle w daivari in an elimination chamber match for the wwe championship it was a cool elimination chamber match but nothing will top last year's elimination chamber which was the best the last three are masters cena carlito carlito turns his back on masters gets a roll up on him to eliminate him seconds later cena gets a roll up on carlito for the three count to win the elimination chamber retain his wwe title but his night was not over yet 7 10 after the match vince mcmahon comes out congratulates cena for his victory vince mcmahon states that his night is not over yet says that edge cashes in his money in the bank opportunity to challenge cena for the title edge comes out with lita gives the briefcase to vince heads off in the ring as cena has one more match to go here tonight br br eight match john cena vs edge w lita for the wwe championship cena who is busted open during the chamber match gets pounded straight away by edge edge then nails a spear on cena goes for the cover to his shock cena breaks out edge nails another spear covers for the shocking three count as he has beat cena has won the wwe championship for the first time in his career 1 10 so last year's new years revolution was better than this year's but it was still alright the ec match was also good the shocking of edge cashing in his mitb opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the ppv show br br overall i'll give it 7 10 a c
<START> i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great
<START> girlfight follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it girlfight is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with
<START> this became a cult movie in chinese college students though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4 uk br br full of arty giddy pretentions the plot is mediocre and unreal the 'spirit' it wants to convey is how independent artists 'resist the commercisliation of music industry' and maintain their' purity of an artistic soul' and wouldnt 'sell themselves for dirty money' that is really giddy and superficial the diologue are mainly pathetic acting is poor sceenplay is full of art pretention it is a fantasy movie for kids and that s all br br
<START> did anybody succeed in getting in this movie br br it's a total mess to me a vague historical sentimental context instead of a plot a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours br br shame on those who wasted money here
<START> kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial to my recollection rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time br br fawcett is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor james russo he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit transparent br br diana scarwid has a bit role as does alfre woodard as the house mate woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the culprit the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it she then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be faced br br a very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated physically and mentally highly recommended 8 10
