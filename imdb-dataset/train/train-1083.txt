<START> i really wanted to love this show i truly honestly did br br for the first time gay viewers get their own version of the the bachelor with the help of his obligatory hag andra james a good looking well to do thirty something has the chance of love with 15 suitors or mates as they are referred to in the show the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this if james picks a gay one they get a trip to new zealand and if he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25 000 how can this not be fun take my hand lets stroll br br the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body the one you'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me god knows there's so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv br br aside from his rather average physical appearance james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk even as such he has this arrogant smugly condescending aura about him however if james were standing up against a blank white wall he'd meld right into in it i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show he is that boring and forgettable in fact one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection i thought that was the best part of the show also james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt sound feminine or sound masculine but don't ing segue tones in the middle of sentences so painful to sit through i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag br br then we have the suitors a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening equally vapid they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair again astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones however in all their banality they still manage to upstage james which isn't all that hard to do anyway slightly that is you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man very sad br br also i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys br br don't get me wrong im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette br br i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box i can accept the mundane apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little no such luck br br if you're expecting drama intrigue sexiness or excitement you will be severely disappointed the biggest drama comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york how scandalous as titillating as that may be i guarantee you that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show br br sure there is the twist but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you you'll easily discern who's who it wasn't hard at all i was only wrong once this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else br br we get to watch as james co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke yawn sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway that's one of main problems with the show no one seems to be enjoying themselves they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame br br finally the physical aspect is not there there's no cuddling no caressing no kissing no endearment of any sort it's just ok that was a boring date im gonna go back to my ugly tacky wanna be sydney operahouse dwelling quick peck on the lips cya this show is so ing prudish it's ridiculous i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men but come the on people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses this show refuses to compromise br br sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling to summarize my three points boring boring boring go do something else you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment at least they have interesting magazines there
<START> i didn't expect a movie as good as in the line of fire or an episode of 24 but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best the good cast couldn't disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best i think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other better movies in it you had car chases big shootouts romance plot twists etc etc this movie has none br br spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba's character you know who's behind all this and all the hints you're being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly br br if it were up to me and maybe it's a good thing that it isn't i would rewrite the plot like this br br first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time
<START> i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it again even if it was without chistopher lee this time to my great disappointment this movie not only does without lee but it does without frankenstein's monster altogether was it a case of if we can't get lee we won't have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much i'm willing to suspend a fair amount but this movie got fairly ridiculous which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it br br peter cushing though is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well the supporting cast is competent but has little to do even the young doctor and his fiancÃ©e blackmailed into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced along with his put upon sidekick to generate some comic relief then they are completely dropped from the movie why we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein's brain transplant experiment there was no tension we weren't invested in the creature and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel br br also there are virtually no horror elements yes there is a beheading in the beginning off camera and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men's skulls off again off camera and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene 90 of which is again off camera i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show but come on if you're not going to give us a monster then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary br br on top of a weak script i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots but otherwise no excitement atmosphere or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was br br the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushing's powerful nuanced performance beyond that i found little in this movie worth recommending instead my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film
<START> what can i say an excellent end to an excellent series it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison ever the end of a great era sorry to see you go
<START> these are excerpts from a nine page memo to mr cohn from mr welles written after orson had seen studio mogul harry cohn's edited version of the picture he took an hour out br br the preview title music was written by a first rate composer george antheil although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable the only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer heinz roemheld is the rather weary one of using a popular song the theme in as many arrangements as possible throughout we have musical references to please don't kiss me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material the tune is pleasing it may do very well on the hit parade but lady from shanghai is not a musical comedy mr roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as disney in other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc etc if the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative i couldn't be unhappier about the results just before i left to go abroad i asked vi viola lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi cab and also quite a bit of dialogue i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the film's opening reel there is nothing in the fact of rita's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo what does matter is rita's beauty the evil overtones suggested by grigsby's character and michael's bewilderment any or all of these items might have inspired the music instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a silly symphony a pratfall by pluto the pup or a wild jump into space by donald duck there is no sound atmosphere on the boat a little wind and water is sorely missed there's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen at the start of the picnic sequence in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy latin american strain this has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel bad stock stuff this sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another whodunit there is a big musical outburst after grigsby's line i want you to kill him this is absurd the hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point as it stands now it's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we're kidding the aquarium scene needs more echo please don't kiss me is in again a bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of michael's run down the pier from the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort for some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo as a result the whole sequence seems dull the audience should feel at this point along with michael that maybe they are going crazy the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they're going to sleep the gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music the closing music again makes reference to please don't kiss me this finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture br br all of these edits from orson were ignored
<START> this may have been based on historical events and we know that the makers of this tv docu drama took liberties to make it more dramatic i can live with that but it was just so badly done i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid air crisis how calm everyone seemed surely someone would have panicked and what a smooth flight no passenger discomfort apparent come on not sure about the regulations nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems ott nonsense but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing common sense tells me this is not a good idea the shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors yet nobody appeared to exit from the front even though the drop was much less the captain went back into the plane after the landing why this was never explained we know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible as i am sure i would have done there were just too many inconsistencies errors and faked action in this i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed it had the potential to be quite thrilling but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing but no real danger the reality of course being somewhat different
<START> bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film it's too bad because it had some potential it's not even close to american pie or something about mary as previous comments might have you believe rent it at dollar night from you local video store if you're kind of bored
<START> this is a total waste of money the production is poor the special effects are terrible in my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as the mummy because of the success of brendan fraser s film i m sure that you can find better horror movies
<START> this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible br br there wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them br br scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix br br examples br br the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader br br the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and wait it hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them up uh hello br br and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrix or terminator br br there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazi's nazi's br br there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either br br just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money
<START> i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was it was a combination of every horror thriller clichÃ© trying to comment on many things including pedophilia satan worship undercover cops affairs religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty washboard the kid and the jesus dude were alright but apart from them anyways i admire the effort though slightly failed on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way even though they did that the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish but then again it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually i've decided it's just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible toooo over dramatic okay i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier it seemed like a poor student project i'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go
<START> as a former 2 time okinawan karate world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie about living living your life for yourself and respect for others empowerment god bless bend it like beckham i believe it is a true gem
<START> marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance i am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing
<START> when a movie like the dukes of hazzard brings in over 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe i'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no effort trash will appeal to br br hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen this is that i walked out despite getting a free movie pass the dialogue could not be dumber the stunts could not be more over the top and outrageous perhaps this bigger that big image appeals to texans but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater none of the big names were in this career ending flick except for burt reynolds which says all you need to hear jessica simpson don't make me laugh br br i wouldn't even recommend this film for video even if you were desperate this was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing they did despite the public being forewarned stupidity abound
<START> killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes aren't the same jokes are lame even the actors aren't as funny because that's the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be funny br br so now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy
<START> as a huge fan of the original i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise br br okay if you are looking for a retread of the original you're in for a big disappointment but if you are looking for something quite different a bit edgy and political then this is the film for you br br gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school where he's being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students when the student insists on meeting up with gregory a series of misadventures ensue that include torture breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved br br if you are looking for something original then i highly recommend this film i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is
<START> this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versions br br i hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time it's one of those rare perfect storms of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time br br dudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moore's performance in arthur doesn't win a best actor oscar it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankenstein br br steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm hearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem it's only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was released br br regarding the dvd that is available as of 1 2007 it's so so although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no widescreen version available br br the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as well br br this the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books
<START> this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life besides farenheit 9 11 all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80 of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies br br liberal blindness an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage
<START> i haven't liked many tv shows post 1990 but that 70s show is great never seeing it during it's first run thinking a gimmicky period piece i was wrong i started watching in reruns and the more i watched the more i liked now it is the only show premiering post 1990 that i watch regularly br br although that 70s show mimics some of the styles attitudes music and tastes of the 70s it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so much funny witty biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichÃ©s by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable br br although a hilarious sitcom no matter what time period the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues family problems teen angst marital issues peer pressure dealing with all of them with comic aplomb that gives the show a mass appeal br br the show's center is one eric forman played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace eric is a super skinny geeky looking non athletic teen and still comes off as super cool due to grace's brilliant self deprecation of the character eric has 5 friends donna hyde kelso jackie and fez played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon danny masterson ashton kutcher mila kunis and wilmer valderama we get to see life in point place wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see donna a forward thinking feminist is the object of eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is eric's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow zen cool one of the group and just sits back observes and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever jackie who starts out as kelso's girlfriend is a verbose self absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b c of kelso but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her and finally fez fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country we never know exactly where and he is a scene stealer i said good day you son of a b tch valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scene stealing moments often help make the show for me br br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble most of it on purpose they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in eric's basement plotting pontificating or just plain playing around br br also figuring prominently in the show are eric's parents the menacing commie hating red and the lovable happy go lucky kitty played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp these 2 adults give the show a much needed mature point of view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do wells red and kitty are ably supported by donna's parents the buffoonish bob played wonderfully for the full run by don stark and blonde bimbo daft midge the super sexy tanya roberts who was on the show for about half it's run additionally for 3 full seasons eric's sister from hell laurie played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents' sides kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps but unfortunately kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie didn't last thankfully and was gone after a few season 6 eps br br sadly at the end of season 7 topher grace eric and early in season 8 ashton kutcher kelso left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it's last grace and kutcher returned for the series finale though giving the show a satisfying end br br a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor top notch supporting players were eternally high leo played to the hilt by tommy chong pastor dave roy the terrific comic jim gaffigan big rhonda mitch earl etc they also got legends marion ross happy days and betty white the mary tyler moore show to play red and kitty's mothers respectively many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well from shirley jones partridge family to pamela sue martin nancy drew to charo to ted nugent to k i s s it goes on and on br br with great nostalgic 70s homages and references hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical take no prisoners style of comedic storytelling that 70s show is a television classic
<START> master cinÃ©aste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family in this film too we see resnais' family members like pierre arditi sabine azema andrÃ© dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death religion suicide love and their overall implications on our daily lives the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends they address each other using a formal you in 1984 while making l'amour Ã  mort resnais dealt with time memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence is love stronger than death it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories message of this film is loud and clear true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation l'amour Ã  mort is like a game which is not at all didactic it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped
<START> i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind movies by will hay and abbot costello especially as those are my favourites i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will hay's oh mr porter which is one of the finest comedies ever made i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago the movie finished at 12 45am i find that movies of this kind to do with ghost trains etc are best viewed at night time with the lights out that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie br br the one liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers i guess this depends on the viewer they are not dated to me though i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released my dad was though i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind sitting in the room in front of the tv with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this it is an escape from reality for a while br br i noticed that one of the men in the movie he has a black mustache he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station this man was in the will hay classic the ghost of st michaels as well just thought i'd point that out in case no one noticed br br the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes br br we need more of this type of movie in todays market but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour this sort of movie making era the ghost train oh mr porter etc to me is the golden age of cinema
