<START> black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us vampyres and much later rest in pieces among others i'm only noting the ones i've seen at any rate we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it and the man keels over not sure if it was good for either of them at that point fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something to that effect and of course everybody else except her is in on something which happens to be devil worship it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times to spice things up though there's a simulated bestiality scene i hope it's simulated with a black goat sure to be a crowd pleaser ugh at times this echoes rosemary's baby minus the baby because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too because that keeps getting remarked upon however the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film the end seems to be back to the beginning again and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part it's not unwatchable it's just not very good and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me 3 out of 10
<START> tasteless i can't even write intelligently about the movie i laughed the entire movie it wasn't supposed to be funny matt farnsworth has no clue what he is doing his story is written it seems without any knowledge of iowa culture and the meth problem i know farnsworth is from iowa which makes his movie even more puzzling to me why do the two main characters have accents it doesn't make any sense the acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch gratituous violence and sex filled the movie i am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy but it came across as unbelievable and offensive the ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all i could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief as i walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears but it did the exact opposite do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant sappy overacted clichÃ©d drivel
<START> modern original romantic story br br very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin br br miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br conclusion good movie br br les pays bas huit points
<START> i haven't seen the first two only this one which is called primal species in england i don't think i'll be bothering to look them out though br br this is an awful film terrible acting bad dialogue cheap rubber monsters everything about it is so nasty the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones especially one called polchak who is an incredible jerk no one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off i was having nightmares he was going to survive the colonel was rubbish too all moody pouts and clueless shouting and the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno i was waiting for her to take her glasses off shake her hair and turn into a vamp but she didn't pity that as it would've livened the film up no end br br didn't roger corman used to make half decent films once
<START> luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth unfortunately her role required no she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni's character he did a fantastic job for his performance set in ancient asia both actors were not asian but were very convincing in their roles i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for she must have been a breakthrough actress one of the first to method act this seems like something that hollywood does often al pacino has played an italian and cuban i felt luise's performance to be lackluster throughout and when she died she did not change in expression from any previous scenes she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice if her brilliant acting was so subtle i suppose i did not see it
<START> when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen i'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage however the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent the visual look including the animation gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically hammered over the head with most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece the voice overs from felisberto especially the one at the end very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing and even that wasn't properly addressed i'm afraid the whole piece came across as at best a 'reasonable first attempt' by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all
<START> it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc the original pilot episode the cage was rejected for being too cerebral when the series was given another chance roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon and did so by writing the menagerie which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still at the time an unaired episode br br this time rather than exploring a new planet kirk and his crew are on starbase 11 paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise christopher pike sean kenney now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident pike joins his successor on the starship where an unpleasant surprise awaits spock who used to serve under pike has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv a planet which is off limits the punishment is death since pike and spock's last visit there 13 years earlier naturally being a logical creature spock turns himself in and arranges a court martial so that he can justify his actions br br there's no need to say more about the plot since the rest will play out in part 2 what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe by coming up with a particular type of flashback to say more would be too much that allows everyone on screen and off to see what could have been of trek had nbc not turned down the original project in particular it's fun to see jeffrey hunter who was unable to return in the menagerie play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoy's early days as spock whose personality hadn't been fully established yet this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite vulcan spontaneously grins br br in short not just a great mystery episode but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down the cage in its original form it's available as part of the season 3 box set
<START> this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlin's best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an afterthought the real horror comes from the prison setting itself and renny h spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling leaking rat infested old hellhole with a sadistic warden too viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very authentic looking prisoners there are no pretty boys in this cast horror fans should check this one out
<START> not sure if i'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director devil hunter sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie br br the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like cannibal ferox and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages ' the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp br br to make matters worse this film has ultra minimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro trash film this one just fell way short br br 2 out of 10 kids
<START> another priyadarshan vohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie akshay paresh and many others but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie br br i was happy with the casting in general except rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit he does however extract some laughs but these were those standard slapstick non original jokes in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner for an extended period who are considered great br br which brings us to the other instrument the dumroo hardly requires any talent it has no variations and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances hmm sounds like rajpal yadav good analogy but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol does br br this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo sometimes both together but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got bored br br the movie has some good dhol good moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo entertaining initially then tolerable then irritating the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on mere bhains ko anda kyun mara if you haven't watched it watch it on filmy it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny br br this movie had its moments the actors did a fine job except rajpal yadav who can act though i've seen him in main meri patniÂ who annoys more than entertains i've said it many time and i'll say it again i really think sharman joshi and tushar kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi star comedies especially br br some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other br br but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added this mean that once the girl was in the following 45 60 mins was increasingly torturous the climax was so bad its almost good category i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable br br the movie is also extremely predictable there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag br br the movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump down or up and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl br br most of the really bad scenes were towards the end one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition the last 10 15 was especially distatefull and completely spoils this movie br br i didn't find tanushree datta quite the siren she was to play and her acting talent is in serious question especially in view of her non appealing looks if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survive br br technically also this movie was weak with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera work br br the songs except the title track were no good either when the songs played in the 2nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audience br br in all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast and the very low expectations br br avoiding it wont be a bad idea br br and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap matinÃ©e or something is a must if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed br br s lots of stale jokes rajpal yadav last 45 mins and last 15 mins especially bad technically bad songs br br s tries to be more than what it was not the regular cast i'm happier for it tanushree datta br br s some good scenes towards the beginning title song good acting and cast except ry br br total 4 5 10 i'm trying to be objective here i don't like rajpal yadav or tanushree datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations so i'm giving it the benefit of all doubts on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4
<START> i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing my first reaction was 'oh god not again ' it's so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable for some reason though i stayed and watched it 'til the end maybe it was my faith in the actors hoping they'd give me something to cheer about br br and surely ken and helena can act also the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point br br helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity then again she has a soft side that's just looking for love the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character this was a triumph of acting the movie itself is nothing unique br br see if you are an acting student if you're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one it's sean penn serious oh my that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokes not for escapists though
<START> we don't have to lose this movie this is one of the greatest i have ever seen jean pierre leaud is amazing more than usual and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue jean eustache is no more on this earth we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors you just have to love this masterpiece i'll never forget it br br p s sorry for the english
<START> this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn't funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i've chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george's mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me br br can someone explain to me how george's head being big is funny it's not even that big i've moved on from characters because they're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don't care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time br br i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive
<START> to borrow from dorothy parker this is not a film to be tossed aside br br lightly it should be thrown with great force br br this is an excruciating mess and i'm a greenaway fan br br mind numbingly awful br br the mummy returns has much more artistic merit
<START> zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining the zombie make up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget b movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
<START> i was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film i didn't enjoy the first one at all and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports after managing to sit through it all avoid avoid avoid
<START> if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it it's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it's not didactic in my opinion it's a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama nathalie press billed as 'natalie' press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually 'normal' but the real star as always is timothy spall surely one of the greatest actors of our time
<START> bogdonovich's mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors bogdanovich blake edwards billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip off of something else this is the high point of bogdanovich's fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off
<START> i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible they are rich little kids who don't have any talent and probably just begged nick to accept them alex has played the drums for one yearm i've played for 4 1 2 the movie is terrible and so is the show this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen it is so stupid it makes me want to barf it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb they are sooo stupid and weird i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off
<START> i gave this more than a 1 because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and i the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this god that and christ is our saviour stuff the movie and the story line did not need it if as i am you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been
