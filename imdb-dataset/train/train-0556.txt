<START> the john goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks the one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of patrick starfish as frosty the story is hopeless written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit everybody is unpleasant and for no reason the plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow
<START> everybody's got bills to pay and that includes christopher walken br br in vietnam a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows including christopher walken following a mad max 3 thunderdome fight and a short massacre later walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other br br cut to the present 1991 and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente he's successful at first but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly which leads walken to assemble the old squad even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people br br mcbain is a monumentally stupid film but for all that it's also a good laugh and action packed too this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window also it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering br br there's plenty of b movie madness to chew on here from michael ironside's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader being watched on television in america nearly brought a brown tear to my nether eye that bit br br it's out there for a quid buy it if you have a sense of humour see how many times you can spot the camera crew too
<START> if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then tigerland is the film for you i love this movie from top to bottom this movie's picture perfect scenes look so real it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama boy i tell you real drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill fated destiny after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an ill fated destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel i see this movie as a crossbreed between stand by me and saving private ryan what do men do when they are with a situation that's hard pressed in real life some men go crazy some men cry some men through fists others do drugs some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse physically this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball but don't get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny bozz collin's character lights it all up and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie i'll let you figure out what their in there for with dialogue war action sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like i said from top to bottom i don't why tigerland is heavily under credited the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing the best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that keep the rare gems coming hollywood 10 10
<START> this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris' outstanding portrayal of john lennon it doesn't matter that harris doesn't exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney wings' silly love songs is worthy of 1 status in america
<START> oh my gosh i thought cbs primetime television shows were the br br worst things gerald mcraney appeared in br br four people are experimented on by a crazed mind control br br computer that's it don't rent it br br i saw this under one of its many titles grey matter and it is br br perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory the other br br reviews are right it is awful never have so many establishing br br shots appeared onscreen never the cast is awful the direction br br is awful and the script is awful i cannot stress how awful this is br br avoid it like you would smallpox br br this is rated pg for physical violence some gun violence mild br br gore some profanity and some adult situations
<START> i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them the film was simply awful i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives it was awful matthew modine's days as a leading man are way over gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters i highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes i really think kettle of fish is a serious contender for the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> human tornado 1976 is in many ways a better film than it's predecessor the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray moore's limitations as an actor it's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted the performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in dolemite br br i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it just like his first film it's catered towards a certain audience i highly doubt that mr moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career check it out br br highjly recommended
<START> spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead br br when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with spongebob but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show br br first off toilet humor isn't all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clichÃ© joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross dressing lololol i just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss somebody help me but of course this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed australians they saw them as nothing but kangaroo loving boomerang throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all over used jokes the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever cosmo is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and cosmo would freak out and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e mail episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid's room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s to others br br if i'm not mistaken i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show thank god everyone around my area says it's like the funniest nickelodeon show ever i just can't agree with itÂ i think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse
<START> writing something genuine and true is challenging knowing how to shoot it and putting it together without making it trivial is even better ishai setton's movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty i have been touched by the big bad swim and from now on i will promote it as far as i can it is just a shame that i can't have something to show to my friends you know such as a dvd because talking is good but giving something to see is better everyone can't go to festivals to discover pearls like that and this movie's really worth to be put out there a big thank you to the staff of this master piece and i am waiting for it to be distributed
<START> roger corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors producers in history he was single handedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever like the edgar allen poe adaptations masque of the red death and pit and the pendulum as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies like creature from the haunted sea and she gods of the shark reef corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and Â simply put Â nearly impossible to judge properly the trip for example as well as this imaginatively titled gas s s s can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation in other words they're incredibly strange hippie culture influenced movies half of the time you haven't got the slightest idea what's going on who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going the plot is simply and yet highly effective a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25 this could be the basic premise of an atmospheric gritty and nail bitingly suspenseful post apocalyptic sci fi landmark but writer george armitage and roger corman decided to turn it into a trippy road movie comedy none of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates gas s s s is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre the entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny definitely not my cup of tea but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers so who am i to say that it's not worth your time or money
<START> stargate sg 1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg 1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole br br having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out i didn't know how good this series would really be 10 years after i had last seen an episode my old impression was that the series was great but my impression was far from the truth stargate sg 1 is more than just a simple sci fi series it is one of the most well made interesting long running exciting sci fi ever produced and why because it runs on an amazing premise br br this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film the sense of familiarity created by a long running series watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show br br stargate sg 1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show br br the first few seasons perhaps up to the 4th 5th focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul'd threat br br from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul'd and preventing attacks on earth after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg 1 in a place of goaul'd replicator ori conflicts br br the 8th season is probably the most mixed one it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments br br the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o'neil they are both good continuations although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak because they seem to be about little more than sg 1 and human jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori br br basically after season 7 exploration was pushed to the background which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery each planet episode presented on the other hand it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were br br even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome but ultimately things are as they are br br in the end because of the fact that i enjoyed everything it's a little hard to find that it ends the big picture however the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg 1
<START> this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen from the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission as it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non chalonte manner with pledge over reacting and over doing the whole eager to be popular role what really took the cake with this one is the final battle absolutely horrible special effects with the guns for example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and vice versa this is accompanied by stop animation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere br br overall this movie is crap just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place
<START> watchable little semi soaper but hardly captivating still two or three funny moments what amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable mcnicol is she plays an invalid a leg problem yet she not only isn't the ugly duckling whom men shun but she is even a man eater and we are supposed to feel for her oh poor little mcnicol with her leg problem poor little mcnicol she is constantly getting passes from men and even dumps them without so much as blinking at one occasion she even has a premeditated one night affair with a blond stud and then she tells her newly found french girlfriend quite non chalantly that it took him time to get an erection makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg conscious if every guy wants to hump her well almost every guy the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone but otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men no shyness no lack of success with men and she throws them away like toys the way she dumped carradine was ridiculous poor little invalid girl i don't think so and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness nervousness the rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems so this flute scene is absurd and doesn't fit into the bigger picture i was also surprised how quickly and eagerly mcnicol makes friends with a french woman who is screwing a married guy on the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled woman's struggle for acceptance or something like that but it's nothing like that at all the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves it's the 80s kind of movie very confusing br br as far as her leg it's not like she has a big fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle she only has a normal looking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg so i really don't understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female quasimodo or something at the beginning of the film it's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck though mcnicol is hardly a major catch kind of cutish but nothing special quite average br br but what the hell is carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy flirting with mcnicol and her pal this guy was in revenge of the nerds but i guess it's the same thing with the carradines in the movies as it is with the kennedys in politics no matter how ugly unable or dumb all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics respectively br br down with nepotism br br if you want to read bogus biographies about the carradines and other hollywood nepotists and morons contact me by e mail
<START> this movie makes me want to fall in love all over again i am naming my next daughter adelaide just so that someone who sings like ol blue eyes can swoon her one day and feel the butterflies i felt hearing it sung and it wasn't even to me i give it a 9 10
<START> my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political historical underpinnings like so many american reviewers tend to do this is not about growing up on main street usa it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else and esther is torn between the tovarish joe and the guys there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito i feel the movie is under rated and it is too bad we have lost the director movies like this make freedom feel more important it is not just another eastern european coming of age film it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom
<START> possible spoilers there is only one reason why i saw this movie and that was because i have a massive crush on richard belzer i don't know that much about humor there were some part that were funny like the barbie and ken spoof and the dealers and the president skit mind you this is sometimes raunchy dare i say crude it was at times funny but it could have been better probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women undress the movie would had been funnier some skits just make you want to gag and cringe others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think sadly this movie is dated if you have a mad crush on richard belzer so worth it it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase
<START> while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes br br unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier
<START> this is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time it has all the right ingredients a mystery corpse a weary middle aged cop corrigan walter kinsella and his rookie sidekick tobin john miles a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the tobin in the shape of a female botanist mary patricia wright who helps solve the crime there's also a terrific shoot out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard br br watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where lt corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'tatooed tilly' before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo confusing huh also later when tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point no wonder he didn't catch him
<START> encompassing virtual reality the potential of computers communication with the past the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society and the fascinating ada byron lovelace portrayed by the fascinating tilda swinton this film should have been great but it is lousy terrible if you consider the potential the acting aside from tilda swinton and karen black veers from tolerable to atrocious the plot construction is awkward to say the least the modern day programmer is a dull one note character but half the movie is spent setting up her character and then when ada finally appears it is to narrate the events of her life not to present an engaging story swinton almost pulls this off though you never fully get to know her as a real person just an icon from a grad student's history paper br br the digital effects such as a digital dog and bird are lousy and distracting considering it was 1997 and not 1985 and finally the script is just bad bad often pretentious dialog especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend which made me squirm cold and distant characters and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder the programmer successfully contacts a person in the past astonishing but it hardly seems to surprise anyone and her boyfriend says well be careful although we're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous and it never seems to actually be dangerous br br also despite being about computers and ada lovelace and her love of mathematics it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief br br one scene towards the end of the movie is quite good a monolog by tilda swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life poignant passionate and insightful it seems to be dropped in from another movie br br so i am disappointed in this movie because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film if you find the subject matter interesting you might want to rent it but be forewarned see orlando for another much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great tilda swinton performance br br spoiler question br br at the end of the movie ada asks that her memories not be preserved in what i thought was the best scene in the movie but then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway transferring the memories into her little girl hence the title of the movie am i correct that the programmer violated ada's wishes without even struggling over it or is this another confusing plot point that i'm misinterpreting
<START> i'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie i saw it at tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed major revision it didn't even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they're snorting the next scene they're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it also the ending just took the cake i'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot script see this movie for comedy if you must
