<START> robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines franchot tone and alan curtis and he does it i might add without a lot of help from his male actors i e curtis and tone it's raines all the way a pretty leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her noir counterparts br br siodmak's use of sex light shadows and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre the shadows lighting effects and camera angles are all effective but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook egged on by an excited raines it's this scene that brings phantom lady into new territory br br siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by raines who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man franchot tone phoned this one in alan curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived and he never except for a brief moment in prison seemed to be in love with raines br br the amusing thing about many of these films is that as world war ii progressed interest in psychiatry deepened but often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as possessed spellbound and the greatest show on earth tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder but he appears to be closer to a psychopath in actuality as evidenced by his headaches he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain br br phantom lady doesn't have the greatest plot but it's well worth watching
<START> this is a clever episode of twilight zone that was comic rather than strange or tragic buster keaton is woodrow mulligan a janitor from 1890 america works in a laboratory he is constantly griping about the life problems around him meat is too expensive it's like 1 00 lb unheard of he is always yelling after crazy speeders on bicycles autos haven't appeared yet griping to the end he sees a helmet like device by a scientist and puts it on and tries it suddenly he is in modern america the beginning was a seven minute silent film now it is all noise all talking all beeping all blowing keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better he runs into stanley adams a professor rollo who realizes that mulligan is from c 1890 he mentions president cleveland rollo has always wanted to live in that charming quiet age he helps mulligan get the helmet repaired and they go back in time rollo gets bored after awhile due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future but now woodrow is fully content with the quiet simple age he lives in he has found contentment br br in his last fifteen years buster keaton was frequently on television many times for allan funt on candid camera where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public he did make a few films as well most notably a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and the railrodder but he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes he is in his element here presumably advising the director old comedy film director norman mcleod he directed the marx brothers in horse feathers on the tricks he could do watch how stanley adams and he time adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs in terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like sherlock jr the episode does show keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties br br the appearances of jesse white here as a repairman of all things is always welcome but look a bit at professor rollo stanley adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977 plump with unkempt appearance and heavy booming voice his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of requiem for a heavyweight he wants anthony quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an indian his best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the starship enterprise in star trek to those furry fertile little creatures tribbles as in the trouble with adams was always worth watching like jesse white and certainly like keaton enhancing most of the productions he appeared in i have never understood his suicide but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer
<START> malÃ©fique is a very interesting movie it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures the central concept is great three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth who the audience identify with and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell br br the atmosphere is well woven it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes' in the chÃ¢teau d'if prior to becoming the count of monte cristo the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell particularly the character we are meant to identify with carrÃ¨re a white collar criminal whose crime is not specified but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud on one occasion carrÃ¨re dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell the claustrophobia is unbroken there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall so even though the film appears to be very modern it has a very old world feel of incarceration br br the characters are intriguing we have marcus a violent pre op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pÃ¢querette french for daisy a heavily retarded young man pÃ¢querette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and unfortunately this included his baby sister hence his current predicament i like this comment on internalisation very primitive lasalle is a withdrawn possessed elderly man in for brutally murdering his wife br br the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you and there's a ritual that goes with that i think that's what disturbs me the most seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically it has a real life ring to it the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong i'm actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self destructive br br i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently particularly with carrÃ¨re also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film not in terms of a successive revelation either i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish more by design than execution such as the famous vagina eye and the sodomy of lasalle for me totally hollow images br br at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with and some things don't seem logical for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about carrÃ¨re's child this doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird a pure horror movie there is no comedic dross or genre segueing like cube 1997 natali the obvious movie to compare it to it's a total immersion experience where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters this last comment i make about it being a pure experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point br br on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge this prompts lasalle to go insane that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge it's something i myself have felt br br one final comment is that two of the quite well received comments on the board have confused the characters' names to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character simply click on philippe laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936
<START> what a weekend two days ago i watched the first half of war games 2 dead code now while she was out i am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching i guess while she was out was worse br br it has all been said before in other comments unrealistic illogical etc the only thing i really have to add is that at some point i started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because i would have recommended her for a darwin award if she actually died only watched first half so i don't know soon i was at two darwin awards if that's even possible for her immense stupidity br br and hey produced by kim basinger so she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us the people i consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent which are idiots a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are
<START> after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound track i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so it was the director br br i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film these days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same br br so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film which you can find out for yourself elsewhere the sound track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss you will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound track and certainly not a cat's meow
<START> ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it's unisol's best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated intelligent and agile all of the new unisols which are faster and stronger than their predecessors are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth a self evolving thought helix when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts he takes matters into his own hands to protect himself killing those who try to shut off his power and unleashing his platoon of super soldiers led by the musclebound romeo seth spares deveraux only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours with the help of a hacker named squid seth takes human form not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin who won't leave his side but luc also must contend with general radford who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth seth has also kidnapped luc's injured 13 year old daughter hillary and is now holding her hostage luc is the only person who can rescue hillary because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks feels and fights now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just so happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and reform him terminator 2 another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it's completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that the good points are there's no dolph hooray and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many i'm still haunted by the scenes in 1 also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists if you don't believe me look it up
<START> being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb br br it's your basic 'who done it ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard br br to me it was worth watching more than once so i'll give it an 8 on imdb
<START> religious bigotry is rampant everywhere australia is not immune to it br br a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby i don't mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting knee deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison br br buy or rent the movie and discover how deep seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe br br this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors br br both meryl streep with her famous aussie accent and sam neill whose accent is his native born pronunciation are outstanding those with supporting roles are also quite good br br you will remember this movie for many years br br see it
<START> firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it incorporates perfectly timed slapstick sexual humour and cleverly thought up stand up but it goes deeper than that the souler opposite is an original love story something we don't see that often that gave me hope that there is love out there that two people who love each other can work through their adversity and that such a comedic take on life something i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future
<START> the first 45 minutes of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable the characters are believable and interesting the cloning lab looks really high tech after that it all collapses the characters start behaving idiotically and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor and this is supposedly present day going critical the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon only it doesn't the finish is incredibly weak one wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong br br all the characters except dean cain are played by russians this results in some weird situations and details like the character being played by vessela dimitrova being called bailey kent despite her heavy accent and despite her on one occasion inexplicably switching to spanish br br because of the decent start i considered rating this movie a 5 but it really was more disappointing than that so i only give it 4

<START> the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like Â¨jurassik parkÂ¨ and some scientists resurrect one of nature's most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey the human visitors tourists and scientific meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre historical animals which are deadlier and bigger in addition a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature's most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims br br the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair raising chills full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts running bound and leaps or dangling over walls and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realistic gory and violent attack scenes other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following Â¨sabretooth 2002 Â¨by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better Â¨10 000 bc 2006 Â¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema the man from snowy river zeus and roxanne robinson crusoe rating below average bottom of barrel

<START> i'm a big fan of b5 having caught on only at the end of season three i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated concluding that it was one of the most well thought out story arcs to ever hit television even the filler episodes were interesting the movies also were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters br br which brings us to 'river of souls' naturally after seeing everything else i had high expectations martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci fi story the story itself might have looked good in outline form even made it to the story board however it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out had this made the regular season it would have rated among the worst of the episodes
<START> the finnish version of robert altman's short cuts set in the small rural town of ÃÃ¤nekoski the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events problems and emotions of human life joy and love deception and disillusionment hopelessness and death i was particularly impressed by two episodes the first is the story of the young waitress who tries to stir up a romance for his co workers she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the routines of the hospital crew despite the signs of occasional empathy compared with altman's classic this movie is perhaps less professional but it is definitely a great piece of art
<START> joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors who have a four day shore leave in hollywood joe knows everything about girls and can't wait to see lola while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls they then run into a little boy donald martin who has ran away in order to join the navy they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan who wants to be a singer clarence wants susie to be his girl but his shyness gets in the way but he doesn't feel shy with a waitress who comes from brooklyn like he does soon joe notices he's in love with susie the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don't even know as they are in a fix with their feelings george sidney's anchors aweigh 1945 is a great musical comedy gene kelly is top notch once again in his singing and dancing routines frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra but he plays his part well kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88 the 9 year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor jose iturbi does great job performing himself it's magic what he does with the piano edgar kennedy plays chief of police station sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse there's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers just look at kelly and sinatra performing we hate to leave it's so energetic if you knew susie like i know susie is quite funny it's a nice moment when frank sings brahms' lullaby to little dean stockwell it's lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango jealousy the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse also tom cat is seen there as the butler they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused the movie was nominated for five oscars but georgie stoll got one for original music score anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment
<START> when i first saw this movie it was titled terror on a train and was the back half of a double feature glenn ford an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives the tension is slow and steady and this black white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes all these years later on tv the tension and drama has lost most of its impact this is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go br br along with ford are anne vernon and maurice denham the villain saboteur is played by victor maddern
<START> then you'd better not watch this movie they've completely ruined the premise of the show in the movie the duke boys are idiots daisy is trampy roscoe is sinister boss hogg is capable uncle jessie is a criminal only cooter and flash are true to the original characters at least enos is kinda close br br at one point they open the doors to get into the general lee nuff said br br the original show may not have been great tv but it was entertaining and the characters made sense this movie is like dumb dumber meets the simple life
<START> christ oh christ one watches stunned incredulous and possibly deranged as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied galapagos tortoise can such things be does this movie actually exist or was i the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen i've seen a lot of films and a lot of bad films but nothing prepared me for this by the end of it i was a gibbering snivelling wreck tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog clawing at the walls howling till my lungs were sore i pleaded desperately frenziedly for mercy to whom this appeal was made i don't know and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of ozu yasujiro sweet weeping jesus the memories sometimes they come back to me when i'm at my most vulnerable when i'm least able to handle them i shudder i break down in tears i bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood but i can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind i'm haunted i'm damaged i'm a shell of a man br br the other user comments here suggest that i am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience which can only mean one of two things a the film does in fact exist or b i am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions what is quite mind boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal or at least have not been left traumatised by it perhaps they're part of the operation god damn them the maniacs god damn them all to hell
<START> i was interested in the title and description of big rig while attending the sxsw film festival in austin tx however i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big rig ended big rig is comprised of several big rig drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states the characters are all wonderful people however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people instead the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide but never do at most we get lost we the audience end up going nowhere and like the direction of the storytelling end up somewhere but without direction location or plot why are we here where are we how did we get here the storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on humanizing a group of people who they regard as overlooked and invisible comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers the directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions overall the story lacks any tension the film is entirely too long should have been a 15 min sketch the big question of so what is never answered and the entire film is one piece of see through propaganda that does nothing to further enlighten as the directors claim the outside world about big riggers
